2009;"The next big company in the crypto space, will be the one that makes it easy to get into Fiat when needed, as fast as possible. Unless banks offer this soon, they will be made redundant, which of course is preferred IMO.

People will need, and do need, to get into Fiat to pay bills etc. There really isn't that much info out there at all. I know I shall be needing to change some of my Btc into Fiat this year - for the first time - as I am going to need the money to live on. Hence the post really. I have been trying various ideas out, while looking for crypto friendly banks, but although some of them are mega, the Fiat side not so much.

I want to be able to cash out some Btc, and have it available as Fiat in my bank account. Or better still, a crypto bank that does both. I could just sell a little Btc, the Fiat goes into my account, and I can pay bills etc. I get that coinbase do a visa card, but that leaves a horrible to sort out tax trail in my mind.

Just putting it out there. I have always hoped that I would eventually not need to get out of Btc and pay bills in Btc, but not yet. I won't be cashing out anymore than I need to as obviously compared to the dog that is Fiat, it's a no brainer. Been hodling Since Jan 17";3
2010;"Not investment advice.

The people most at risk are late 20s-mid 40s. I'm talking rekt financially in general.

For those 30 and under, they have only experienced working life of everything goes up, good economy, and easy credit. For the older ones, those who avoided getting rekt in the 08 housing meltdown actually benefited. This benefit shows up in the mid 30s to mid 40 year olds who have multiple properties and/or massive homes with significant equity. Many at the time (myself included) did not realize the game they were playing was stacked in their favor.

I think we are halfway through the run. I've never seen a market like this. Retail, institutions, the halving, money printing gone crazy, and supply shocks of commodities and products from covid.

I'm starting to see friends who have tons of cash wake up-they've lost 10-20% of real value. A house that they wanted is now out of reach...my guess in many cities it will be permanently out of reach. The days of 30% of income going to a house are over-you can do that, but you better have some rich parents or equity.";3

2012;"I wanted to share a story of my relationship with Bitcoin which started in early 2017. A coworker had first introduced this idea of bitcoin to me in our hallway chat and I ultimately have him to thank for being the type of person that could explain this to me really in-depth. Mind you, we are engineers so this type of nerd-tech is very appealing to us, at least more than the average joe. After he explained to me the significance of bitcoin and its potential use case, I was enthralled by its beautiful simplicity and used of computational mathematics to allow people to share money peer to peer. I remember watching YouTube videos and trying my best to understand how transactions were verified and what exactly the value was of this digital code in cyberspace. I'll be honest, it still is quite challenging to fully understand, but I think superficially I can understand its basic operation. Anyway, that conversation sparked an interest in me and I subsequently learned about exchanges and this new idea of a digital wallet. I promptly opened an account on an exchange and bought my first BTC, ETH, and some LTC. I remember watching my wallet like a hawk and even took some profits after what was probably a quick pump. Woohoo, I made $2k on that first position. I thought I was a fucking baller and for reference, BTC was probably around $1k at that time. I then do what all crytpo noobs did an invested those gains into other shitcoins and ICOs. Oh, the ICO craze of 2017. A lot of people learned lessons that year. I think I ended up only slightly in green after that entire fiasco. I had not held BTC all the way to $20k either. I just couldn't allow myself to buy something that parabolic. Then, I watched the market quickly crash and go into its bear cycle. I saw how low the demand was, FUD was at an all-time high, and not one peep about bitcoin in the mainstream media. For the newbies, when you don't hear about bitcoin -- FYI you're in the bear market. I ultimately forgot about BTC and thought all of the HODLers who's posts I read on reddit were fucking crazy. I decided to stay away for the time being because I didn't understand.

Now let's talk about how to lose big with opportunity costs.

Fast forward to the pandemic-induced crash of 2020. I knew the stock market had a nice juicy dip. I had been saving a bunch of money from salary pay and was just patiently waiting for some type of crash to occur, so I promptly opened up a robinhood account with $5k and acquired a variety of discounted stocks. However, I also noticed that bitcoin was hovering a price of $4500 or so. I thought wow, we've come a long way from that $20k rally in 2017. I used the leftover money in the RH account, about $200, and put in in. I thought eh, why not. BTC has been so sideways and now at $4k I figured it wouldn't hurt. I still wasn't a believer. 

Fast forward to end of Feb 2021. BTC rallies to $60k. Even for the past few weeks, it has yet to even dip below $50k. I now have been stacking sats more than ever before in my life. I watch a bunch of YouTube videos, hangout in the clubhouse rooms, listen to podcasts...the whole nine. I kick myself for waiting SO FREAKING LONG to just HODL and believe in this technology. With the money I had in a savings (pftt a fiat savings account, what a fucking joke), had I invested most of that into that delectable price of ~$4k, I would have been a millionaire this year. A fucking millionaire. However, as the great Michael Saylor said, """"You buy bitcoin at the price you deserve it."""" Truer words cannot be spoken. I deserved to buy at $47k. You know what though? I am more convinced in the revolutionary power of bitcoin at $47k than I ever was at $4k. I think that is the most important thing about becoming a bitcoin convert. When you don't believe, you stare at a price of 4 thousand dollars per bitcoin and think, """"meh."""" Most of you who have just started your crypto journey are probably on the fence too. I have a theory that it takes people a whole bull/bear cycle to finally take this seriously. It took me getting into this space in 2017 to understand what it’s like to lose faith, and then to have it restored in the bull run. Yes BTC can go to $20k, $40k,…$100k and beyond? YES. Even when this run comes crashing down, I'm HODLing my precious coins. So, I just wanted to share this story for those of you who might not understand yet. The maxis, the hodlers, the methodical sat stackers ... were all part of the ecosystem built on the hardest currency that has ever existed in our lifetime. 
TL; DR
It took me a whole bitcoin cycle to come to terms with how powerful and meaningful bitcoin is for our generation. I was not convinced in 2017, but now I'm bullish as fuck and HODLing for life. 

I have some quick tips to share, just keep in mind I am in no way a financial advisor or financial expert. I'm just a guy who wants to make life changing monetary decisions for his family.
1)	Take BTC seriously now, don't wait. Chances are you have residual income sitting in a savings account. Unless you have an immediate need for it, invest it in bitcoin. Keep enough fiat to have a safety net in life incase you lose your job or whatever, but always stack sats. 
2)	Try you best to learn from as many different sources as you can. Get different opinions. Talk to people. Read. Find what you believe in and make sure you can explain it to someone clearly. For me, BTC is king.
3)	Set up a reoccurring payment on cash app. This will help you dollar-cost-average your way into bitcoin. They also have an awesome boost on their debit card that rewards you in BTC. 
4)	Hold your own keys. Stop leaving BTC in an exchange. You never know when you’re most vulnerable. Stay safe and don't get rekt.
5)	Tell everyone you know about bitcoin to the point it makes you annoying. Wealthy people who own mass amounts of fiat would like to keep you poor, to hide their secrets to wealth. Bitcoiners want everyone to participate and share knowledge. As the network increases (nodes and hodlers), so does the power of bitcoin. We’re in this together. 
6)	Never underestimate how messy it can be to sell during the blow off top. You might think you’re going to cash out in the high six figure range. I’m here to warn you that everyone else thinks that too. How are you going to sell when Coinbase crashes due to too many users selling at the same time? Either figure out how to efficiently take profits, or adjust your expectations. After all, we all rely on pretty much a handful of exchanges. Expecting them to perform under the most burdensome load is not realistic. 
7)	Be happy. You are staring at the opportunity of a generation. You are not late. If you’re here right now, you’re still early. No matter what, if you just HODL you will come out on top.";5

Thanks!;3
2017;"I find it very strange that a lot of people keep posting about the person who bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in 2010.  They then go on to praise Laszlo for using bitcoin as it was intended and """"helping"""" bitcoin adoption and other nonsense.

He did neither of these things by selling Bitcoin for 2 pizzas.  In doing so he signaled to the market that 2 pizzas are worth more than 10,000 bitcoin.  If you believe this helps bitcoin's adoption or economy, I ask that you kindly take your economic ignorance and get the fuck out.  Perhaps you and your shitty Keynesian ideas would be better suited in /r/Economics.

What is almost never mentioned is the person who accepted 10k bitcoin for 2 pizzas.

2018;" 

When discussing the regulations about defi you may believe it only applies to altcoins. This is deeply wrong and misguided. First of all there are platforms being developed that use unwrapped native bitcoin. Second of all, any of these laws against DeFi in general will absolutely destroy the future of bitcoin as an independent government free tool. It will be fully controlled by KYC, globally, in every single area except private wallet to wallet transactions. anything that so much as looks like Local Bitcoins will be KYC'd with extreme prejudice. You will have no real fundamental freedom from the government. Microsoft is even developing bitcoin layer 2 smart contracts that have built in KYC. 

Chainalysis will be used against you with extreme prejudice, very little bitcoin will truly be fungible, and it will be dangerous to acquire. 

What the bitcoin community tries to convey as a antithesis to altcoins, to me really comes across as an antithesis to layer 2 solutions. 

Bitcoiners do not want to deal with the regulations that will fundamentally dictate layer 2 and lightning network, yet if the western governments get their way, none of these layer 2 functionalities will ever exist without KYC and mass surveillance, ergo you will never see the separation of money and state. 

This is why the definition of non entities, non companies, non custodians as vasp is a mortal threat to liberty and the values of bitcoin. It's why the travel rule is so bad. It prevents any real freedom from this state intrusion. 

You as a community need to realize what layer 2 is, what web 3.0 is, and defend it, because it is the most important cultural battle of our lives.";3

2030;"Just thinking out loud.  Tell me how dumb all of this sounds.

Current mining:

&amp;#x200B;

*  fee is added to every transaction.
* miners sift through the transactions and poach the most profitable ones (based on fee) to include in the next block.
* this leaves transactions out of blocks when the size of all incoming transactions is greater than the allowed block size for the next block.
* during times of high activity, this causes fees to rise.  Rising fees causes more investment in mining.  BUT, not more throughput into mining is accomplished.
* during times of low activity, the older transactions are cleared.
*  if a transaction becomes old enough without getting mined, it is forgotten entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

The above is based on a single decision, the fixed block size.  But, what if we had variable block sizes that were allowed at certain times?  What if we had classes/grades/tiers of transactions?

For instance, let's play around with the idea:

*  Three tiers of transactions are declared possible.  The first tier equates to the the bell-curve of the middle X% of transactions at any given time based on fee included in the transaction.  These transactions basically behave (are treated like) as they do today.
*  As a transaction is created, the software responsible for building the transaction should set the fee (based on user input), but also classify the transaction (this is new). 
* As a transaction is created, the software responsible for building the transaction should examine the mempool to determine which rates will trigger which classifications for this transaction.  

1.  If a chosen fee on a transaction would result in that transaction being within the bottom 15% of the mempool (based on fee average), then it can be/is to be labeled as a 'bottom tier' transaction before getting added to the mempool.
2. If a chosen fee on a transaction would result in the transaction being minable with in the next half-block (or some %), then it can be/is to be labeled as a 'top tier' transaction before getting added to the mempool.
3. Otherwise, transactions are labeled as 'standard-tier'.

* Top-Tier transactions are given priority over transactions of other tiers.  Full Stop.  As too many people try to create premium tier transactions, they'll end up having to have them labeled as standard-tier.  This means that during times of high demand, you'll know, during transaction creation, whether or not you can expect your funds to transfer during the next block.  You can up your fee accordingly.  It also means that only so many will/can get in.  During times of rapidly changing demand, there can be some top-tier transactions that have lower fees than standard-tier transactions!  This is different from the behavior today.  Today, every block is evaluated based on every transaction's current status regardless of the state of the mempool when the transaction was first created.
* Standard-tier transactions are processed much as they are today.  Premium transactions come first, but premium transactions are limited to a percentage of the block size, so some standard transactions will always be processed in every block.
* Bottom-tier transactions are guaranteed to clear within two weeks (ish).  Every x number of blocks (based on a week), a bottom-tier clearing is enforced on miners.  A single larger block is mined with transactions consisting of premium-tiers + standard-tiers + every bottom-tier transaction that is older than 1 week.  This block can be of any size necessary to clear the queue of older bottom-tier transactions.
* Standard-tier transactions are guaranteed to clear within about a week.  Every x number of blocks (based on a half-week or thereabouts), a standard-tier clearing is enforced on miners.  A single larger block is mined with transactions consisting of premium-tiers + every standard-tier transaction that is older than a half week.  This block can be of any size necessary to clear the queue of older standard-tier transactions.
* Bottom-tier transactions created one day earlier will have to wait until the next week's clearing.  In this manner, you must wait between one and two weeks for a bottom-tier transaction to clear.  But it is guaranteed to clear.

1. Standard-tier transactions created one day earlier will have to wait until the next half-week's clearing.  In this manner, you must wait between a half and a full week for a standard-tier transaction to clear.  But it is guaranteed to clear.

* We end up with a system where people who NEED immediate bitcoin transfers can get them into the next block reliably with a positive understanding of the fee necessary to make that happen.  This is, for the most part, possible today, but it formalizes the process and guarantees that it happens.
* Standard-tier transactions will end up working a lot like they do today.  However, there will be a guarantee that they will clear in a relatively soon amount of time.  This amount of time will be less than bottom-tier transactions.
* In the end, pricing can rise or fall based on demand just like it does today.  Mining profits can rise and fall based on demand just as it does today.  But, most importantly, everyone understands what cost is required to provide a level of service and transactions are guaranteed to clear rather than be dumped from the mempool.

I think this might be a decent compromise?  For instance, every \~10 minutes, people with a need for a nearly instant transaction will have the tools necessary to make that financial decision.  In practice, they are bidding on their right to enter the next block.  If they can wait (and most can, let's be honest), they have two other tiers to play with.  Bottom-tier transactions will probably always sit at 1 sat per v-byte.  But so what?  People who don't care to wait, do that anyway (I did earlier this year).  Within the standard-transaction tier, pricing still matters as higher fees will still result in shorter wait times for getting included in a block.

&amp;#x200B;

Ramifications:

* Someone could try to spam the mempool by including terabytes of transactions.  But they'll have to pay ***something*** to do so, so miners that can successfully pull those blocks off will still reap those rewards.
* This will remove many headwinds against people spending bitcoin on smaller transactions.  There will still be a lower bound (if 1 sat were $10, then you wouldn't buy a $0.35 piece of candy with bitcoin), but micro transactions can be handled by lightning, or some other solution).
* Businesses, in general, won't really care to wait on standard-tier (or even bottom-tier in certain cases) transactions.  There isn't an expectation of immediate payments now, in business, so floating something before payment arrives is acceptable already today.  If a business knows that a standard/bottom tier transaction is \*in\* the mempool and has a idea of when it is guaranteed to clear, then that will open up their ability to use bitcoin for customer transactions.

\----------

So, this is a very amateur pass at a thought experiment around variable block sizes (limited to certain reliable conditions).   The specifics in this post aren't the point.  The number of tiers, percentages used to determine which pier, time to wait, etc. are all fluid.  This is just meant to stir a conversation.  And, for all I know, there are alts that already do this.

This coupled with legislation to remove capital gains taxes on smaller transactions would go a long way toward making bitcoin truly adoptable for most everyday transactions.  It sure would be nice if our law makers could work in concert with bitcoin developers to perhaps formally define which types of transactions ***would*** be susceptible for capital gains.  Imagine capital gains, for instance, only people applied to certain tiers.

“The EVERYTHING Short

My fellow apes,
After writing Citadel Has No Clothes, I couldn't shake one MAJOR issue: why do they have a balance sheet full of financial derivatives instead of physical shares? Even Melvin keeps their derivative exposure to roughly 20%...(whalewisdom.com, Melvin Capital 13F - 2020)
The concept of a hedging instrument is to protect against price fluctuations. Hopefully you get it right and make a good prediction, but to have a portfolio with literally 80% derivatives.... absolute INSANITY.. it's is the complete OPPOSITE of what should happen.. so WHAT is going on?
Let's break this into 4 parts:
 1. Repurchase &amp; Reverse Repurchase agreements
 2. Treasury Bonds
 3. Palafox Trading
 4. Short-seller Endgame

Ok, 4 easy steps... as simple as possible.
Step 1: Repurchase &amp; Reverse Repurchase agreements.
WTF are they?
A Repurchase Agreement is much like a loan. If you have a big juicy banana worth $1,000,000 and need some quick cash, a repo agreement might be right for you. Just take that banana to a pawn shop and pawn it for a few days, borrow some cash, and buy your banana back later (plus a few tendies in interest). This creates a liability for you because you have to buy it back, unless you want to default and lose your big, beautiful banana. Regardless, you either buy it back or lose it. A reverse repo is how the pawn shop would account for this transaction.
Why do they matter?
Repos and reverse repos are the LIFEBLOOD of global financial liquidity. They allow for SUPER FAST conversions from securities to cash. The repo agreement I just described is happening daily with hedge funds and commercial banks. In fact, the submitted amount for repo agreements today (3/29) was $40.354 BILLION. This amount represents the ONE DAY REPO due on 3/30. So yeah, SUPER short term loans- usually a few days. It's probably not a surprise that back in 2008 the go-to choice of collateral for repo agreements was mortgage backed securities..
Lehman Brothers went bankrupt because they fraudulently classified repo agreements as sales. You can do your own research on this, but I'll give you the quick n' dirty:
Lehman would go to a bank and ask for cash. The bank would ask for collateral in return and Lehman would offer mortgage backed securities (MBS). It's great having so many mortgages on your balance sheet, but WTF good does it do if you have to wait 30 YEARS for the cash.... So Lehman gave their collateral to the bank and recorded these loans as sales instead of payables, with no intention of buying them back. This EXTREMELY overstated their revenue. When the market started realizing how sh*tty these """"AAA"""" securities actually were (thanks to Michael BRRRRRRRRy &amp; friends), they were no longer accepted as collateral for repo loans. We all know what happened next.
The interest rate in 2008 on repos started climbing as the cost of borrowing money went through the roof. This happens because the collateral is no longer attractive compared to cash. My favorite bedtime story is how the Fed stepped in and bought all of the mean, toxic assets to save the US economy.. They literally paid Fannie &amp; Freddie over $190 billion in bailouts..

A few years later, MF Global would suffer the same fate when their European repo exposure triggered a massive margin call. Their foreign exposure to repo agreements was nearly 4.5x their total equity.. Both Lehman and MF Global found themselves in a major liquidity conundrum and were forced into bankruptcy. Not to mention the other losses that were incurred by other financial institutions... check this list for bailout totals.
But.... did you know this happened AGAIN in 2019?
https://preview.redd.it/9htr7vn8g9q61.jpg?width=912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25995c33d0056f6108471baa373d1a371b5d0cd5
Instead of the gradual increase in rates, the damn thing spiked to 10% OVERNIGHT. This little blip almost ruined the whole show. It's a HUGE red flag because it shows how the system MUST remain in tight control: one slip and it's game over.
The reason for the spike was once again due to a lack of liquidity. The federal reserve stated there were two main catalysts (click the link): both of which removed the necessary funds that would have fueled the repo market the following day. Basically, their checking account was empty and their utility bill bounced.
It became apparent that ANOTHER infusion of cash was necessary to prevent the whole damn system from collapsing. The reason being: institutions did NOT have enough excess liquidity on hand. Financial institutions needed a fast replacement for the MBS, and J-POW had just the right thing.. $FED go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
\""""but don't say it's QE..\""""

Step 2: Treasury Bonds
Ever heard of the bond market? Well it's the redheaded step-brother of the STONK market.
The US government sells you a treasury bond for $1,000 and promises to pay you interest depending on how long you hold it. Might be 1%, might be 3%; might be 3 months, might be 10 years. Regardless, the point is that purchasing the US Treasury bond, in conjunction with mortgage backed securities, allowed the fed to keep pumping unlimited liquid tendies into the repo market. Surely, liquidity won't be an issue anymore, right?
Now... take the repo scenario from the Lehman Brothers story, but instead of using ONLY mortgage backed securities, add in the US Treasury bond: primarily the 10-year. Note that MBS are still prevalent at 19.1% of all repo transactions, but the US Treasury bond now represents a whopping 67%.
https://preview.redd.it/t5jkjj5bg9q61.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8add42402770ffcb76f2cfcb56e4f28196a42e96
For now, just know that the US Treasury has replaced the MBS as the dominant source of liquidity in the repo market.

Step 3: Palafox Trading
Ever heard of Palafox Trading? Me either. It's pretty much meant to be that way.
Palafox Trading is a market maker for repurchase agreements. Initially, they appear to be an innocent trading company, but their financial statements revealed a little secret:
https://preview.redd.it/8w7uhymcg9q61.png?width=723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2350bca6b44c8d470904525dc7dfca914cc7f7a
Are you KIDDING ME?... I should have known...
OF COURSE Citadel has their own private repo market..
Who else is in this cesspool?!
https://preview.redd.it/ah5775qdg9q61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad4ab23bdee3739d06f4443e97da4c6172199590
I made this using the financial statement listed above, showing all beneficiaries of the GFIL
Everything rolls into the Citadel Global Fixed Income Master Fund... This controls $123,218,147,399 (THAT'S BILLION) in assets under management... I know offshore accounts are technically legal for hedge funds.... but when you look at the itemized holdings of these funds on Citadel's most recent form ADV, it gives me chills..
Form ADV page 105-106....
https://preview.redd.it/ho4j0oghg9q61.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=147c10a38cfc2857b4b2691fe70f088a88e83091
Ok... ok.... let me get this straight....
 1. The repo market provides IMMEDIATE liquidity to hedge funds and other financial institutions
 2. After the MBS collapse in 2008, the US Treasury replaced it as the liquid asset of choice
 3. Citadel owns 100% of Palafox Trading which is a market maker for repo agreements
 4. This market maker provides liquidity to the Global Fixed Income Master Fund LTD (GFIL) through Citadel Advisors
 5. 80% of its $123,218,147,399 in assets under management belong to entities in the Cayman Islands
Ok.....I tore the bermuda, paradise, and panama papers apart and found that all of these funds boil down to just a few managers, but can't pin anything on them for money laundering... However, if there EVER were a case for it, I'd be extremely suspicious of this one...
The level of shade on all this is INCREDIBLE... There should be NO ROOM for a investment pool as big as Citadel to hide this sh*t.... absolutely ridiculous..
The fact that there is so much foreign influence over our bond &amp; repo market, which controls the liquidity of our country, is VERY concerning..

Step 4: Short-seller Endgame
Alright, I know this is a lot to take in..
I've been writing this post for a week, so reading it all at one time is probably going to make your head explode.. But now we can finally start putting all of this together.
Ok, remember how I explained that the repo rate started to rise in '08 because the collateral was no longer attractive compared to cash? That means there wasn't enough liquidity in the system. Well this time the OPPOSITE effect is happening. Ever since March 2020, the short-term lending rate (repo rate) has nearly dropped to 0.0%....
https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-repo-reference-rates
So the fed is printing free money, the repo market is lending free money, and there's basically NO difference between the collateral that's being lent and the cash that's being received.. With all this free money going around, it's no wonder why the price of the 10 year treasury has been declining.
In fact, hedge funds are SO confident that the 10 year treasury will continue to decline, that they've SHORTED THE 10-YEAR BOND MARKET. I'm not talking about speculative shorting, I mean shorting it to oblivion like they've shorted stocks.
Don't believe me?
Hedge funds like Citadel Advisors must first locate the treasury bond in order to swap them for cash in the repo market. It's extremely difficult to do this with the fed because they're tied up in government BS, so they locate a lender in the market. Now who would Citadel know that's an asset manager?
Perhaps the SAME asset manager that they borrow shares from - BlackRock. It's now obvious why BlackRock was tapped by the US Government to purchase their treasuries.
https://preview.redd.it/d83rby6mg9q61.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13f248c705140dade0d286a2108b1807f3b3ea6d
So BlackRock purchases a sh*t load of treasuries and keeps them on reserve for hedgies like Citadel to short. Citadel comes along and asks for the bond, they throw it into Palafox Trading and collect their cash. So what happens when they need to pay for their repo agreement? Surely to GOD there are enough bonds floating around, right? Not unless hedge funds like Citadel have shorted more bonds than there are available.
Here's the evidence.
There have been 3 instances over the past year where the repo rate dipped below the """"failure"""" rate of -3.0%. On March 4th 2021, the repo rate hit -4.25% which means that investors were willing to PAY someone 4.25% interest to lend THEIR OWN MONEY in exchange for a 10 year treasury bond.
This is a major signal of a squeeze in the treasury market. It's MAJOR desperation to find bonds. With the federal reserve purchasing them monthly from the open market, it leaves room for a shortage when the repo call hits. If an entity like BlackRock hasn't purchased more treasuries since lending them out, hedge funds like Citadel simply cannot cover unless they go into the market and PAY the bond holder for their bond. It's literally the same story as all of the heavily shorted stocks.
Still not convinced?
At the end of 2020, Palafox Trading listed $31,257,102,000 (BILLION) in GROSS repo agreements. $30,576,918,000 (BILLION) were directly related to repurchasing treasury bonds....
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
But what about their Reverse Repurchase agreements? Don't they have assets to BUY treasury bonds?SURE.. Take a look..
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
SeE tHeRe? I tOlD yOu ThEy HaD iT cOvErEd..
Yeaaaah... now read the fine print.
I know the totals are slightly different than the balance above, but they're both from 2020. It's just how they are presented. Check for yourself. (https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170)
So no, they don't have it covered. Why? Because our POS financial system allows for rehypothecation, that's why. It's a big fancy word for using amounts owed to you as collateral for another transaction. In the event that the party defaults, SO DO YOU.
This means that the securities which Palafox is waiting to receive, have ALREADY been pledged to pay off the bonds they currently OWE to someone else.
Does this sound familiar? Promising to repay something with something you don't already have? Basically you need to wait on Ted, to repay Steve, to repay Jan, to repay Mark, to repay you, so you can repay Fred, so Fred can.... Yeah, REAAAAL secure..
OH, and by the way, the problem is getting WORSE.
Here's Palafox's financial statements in 2018:
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
And 2019:
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
The amount in 2020 is STILL +100% greater than 2019, AFTER netting (which is even more bullsh*t).
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170

All of this made me wonder what the FICC's balance is for treasury deposits... For those of you that don't know, the FICC is a branch of the DTCC that deals with government securities.
Just like the updated DTC rule for supplemental liquidity deposits being calculated throughout the day, the FICC also calculates this amount as it relates to treasury securities multiple times throughout the day.
Would you be surprised that the FICC has $47,000,000,000 (BILLION) just in DEPOSITS for unsettled treasury bonds? $47,000,000,000!?!?!?
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW ASTRONOMICAL THE ACTUAL MARGIN MUST BE?!
https://preview.redd.it/zrkpzdb1h9q61.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f6b10aca2566bcf9b5d560967af3715104b839

There is TOO much evidence, from TOO many separate events, pointing to the imminent default of something big. That's all this is going to take. When Ted can't repay Steve, it means the panic has already started. Just look at how easy it was for the repo rate to spike overnight in 2019..
We are already starting to see the consequences of the SLR update with Archegos, Nomura, and Credit Suisse. This is just a taste of what's to come.. and now we know the bond market represents an even BIGGER catalyst in triggering this event.. and it's happening already.
With that being said, things finally started to make sense... Citadel doesn't NEED shares if their investment strategy to go short on EVERYTHING instead of going long. Why bother owning shares? BlackRock and other asset managers simply lend them to you when you need to pony up a margin call for stocks and bonds..
Their HFT systems allow them to manipulate the market in their favor so there's NO way they could fail.... unless.... a bunch of degenerates all decided to ignore taking profits...
But that would NEVER happen, right?
...wrong...
we just like the stonks

2048;"&gt;The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Bitcoin Institutional FOMO Hype train is still ongoing and so is the Bull Market!!

I have a question with regard to transfer fees and coin movement.

I recently decided to move my portfolio from eToro to Coinbase Pro and BlockFi. Unfortunately there was no way to move directly from eToro without using the eToro wallet. So I requested my BTC be transferred to my eToro wallet. After it arrived I attempted to make a deposit into my BlockFi account.

This is where I ran into an issue. The eToro wallet said I had an available balance and gave an estimated Blockchain fee. So I requested a transfer of my available balance minus the transfer fee to my BlockFi account. It was rejected shortly after saying that I requested more than my available balance due possibly due to the Blockchain fee. I kept trying to lower the amount in tiny increments until I finally was able to get a successful deposit. But just as I had feared when I went back to my eToro wallet there is a small amount  orphaned there. Now it looks like I can't move that tiny amount because the fee is higher than the value of that balance.

How can I get this last bit out of my wallet?

Also, how can I avoid this in the future moving coins between my cold wallet and Coinbase Pro/BlockFi? I searched all over for Blockchain calculator but was unsuccessful.

I’m lost on this one and don’t know what to do so I thought I’d try here and see what info I can get. Thanks in advance.

So a cryptocurrency exchange apparently had a """"system issue” (their words) that made it so you could buy bitcoin for much lower than the current price and I placed a bunch of trades to buy bitcoin and then they closed my account when they figured out this. But now the coins are bought are sitting in my account and they sent me a message saying that they are going to calculate the difference off the coins I bought and then let me transfer out the rest of the coins and they will close my account thereafter. I just want to know if they can legally do this or if the coins now belong to me. Any advice is welcome on this issue. 

Thanks.";3

 ***A longtime Bitcoin bull and the founder of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz*** [***spoke about Bitcoin's future.***](https://news.bitcoin.com/boomers-adopt-cryptocurrency-trillion-dollars-bitcoin-novogratz/)

He explained that as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, rich baby boomers will be the next generation to come to the bitcoin market.

&gt;*“It could be as much as a trillion dollars comes over the next year from that giant group of wealth."""" - declared Novogratz.*

Baby Boomers are those who were born around the end of World War II until the mid-1960s. They were the main beneficiaries of the massive stimulus packages that pumped asset values ​​in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Many of them see bitcoin as an asset that can significantly increase its value, as well as protect their savings from inflation caused by the massive printing of money.

&gt;*""""If you’re worried that the U.S. is printing too many dollars … you’re going to shift some of your savings into bitcoin.""""*  
*- Michael Novgorats.*

If the CEOs of JMP Securities and Galaxy Digital are not wrong, then in the coming months, huge amounts of money will begin to flow into the bitcoin market, and by the end of the year, their inflow will amount to $2.5 trillion. Now the capitalization of the first cryptocurrency is $1.2 trillion. If you add these two sums, then the capitalization of BTC by the end will reach $3.7 trillion, hence the price of bitcoin will be $177,754.

But since in free circulation, according to Glassnode, at the beginning of the year there were only 4.2 million bitcoins, a reasonable question arises: *what exactly are the listed groups of investors going to buy?* Everything that is available to them on the market today, taking into account all the bitcoins available on exchange wallets and in OTC, is a maximum of 4.2 million BTC.

If we subtract from the total emission of bitcoin, which is 18.6 million today, belonging to the class of illiquid 14.5 million, then the estimated price of bitcoin will be **$711,000 by the end of the year**. And this is without taking into account the money of other buyers, who, of course, are present in the market and their number is growing all the time. It is worth adding an element of common panic buying that can arise against the backdrop of the rapid rise in the price of BTC.

Last year alone, Grayscale Capital and other funds bought about 1 million bitcoins on the market. Under the above-mentioned scenario, no more than 1 million BTC will remain in free circulation by the end of the year.

**Turns out, “To The Moon” is much closer than expected.**

Thanks to Michael Novogratz for the tip.";4

2084;"The bitcoin network does \*not\* transfer money.  


What is the ontological status of a bitcoin?  
Bitcoins are proofs that computers performed a series of pointless math calculations.  


These proofs are \*not\* monetary instruments, securities, bonds, obligations. They have nothing to do with finance. A bitcoin does \*not\* entitle its holder to anything whatsoever. A dollar while subjective in value allows me to pay objective tax obligations. The dollar itself has \*no\* value, what has \*value\* is that which labor power created. Dollars just allow us to organize labor power in more complex interactions. That is \*all\* money is.  


Comparing to Visa is completely meaningless considering that visa process payments of actual dollars. Visa \*shifts\* dollars between balance sheets. Bitcoin does \*not\*.   


The ownership of bitcoin may change based on who holds the private key but that is \*not\* the same thing as transferring money.  


Just because bitcoin has the nominal word COIN in it does \*not\* make it money. Names reflect \*essences\* that are \*knowable\* however inprecisely to us. They are real.  


So lets stop it with the claims that the bitcoin network transfers 'billions'. It transfers the ownership of a proof that computers performed pointless math problems.   


What is the \*economic value\* of these proofs? To determine that we ask, does bitcoin improve the efficiency of energy transfer? Do I get more output with less input? The answer is no.   


So the economic value of bitcoin is zero. If bitcoin mining \*does not\* locate a power source which is near free, the entire network will collapse.";3

2102;"Hey there, still learning my way around crypto (as will become evident), sorry if this post somehow breaks the rules.

Tl;Dr: I had a large amount of crypto stolen from me and I'm seeking experienced opinion on CNC Intelligence who claim to have experience in asset recovery, among other things. I'm not looking for other security tips or to be reminded of how I could have better protected myself, I just need help with discerning the legitimacy of this company.

Please try to resist posting if you don't have relevant evidence or specific experience dealing with CNC Intelligence; It's been very difficult to come to peace with what happened to me because I've had a hard time discerning palpable evidence into the legitimacy of this company who claim to be capable of helping in crypto retrieval. My scam-alarm is ringing at high volume, so I'm looking for legitimate, experienced feedback to help me decide whether to proceed with their services.

I had BTC / ETH stolen from me last week, and in a bid to try and recoup some of the lost cost, after contacting police and the brokerage I held the coin on, I reached out to numerous 'crypto asset recovery' companies after long and panicked googling. 

CNC Intelligence / CNCIntel have been the only ones to respond; I've exchanged communications with a representative, they've ostensibly examined the TxIDs and determined that 'something' can be done to get the coin back. 

I'm aware that BTC and ETH transactions are irreversible. Thus, the only way I'd naively understand to get anything out of this would be to either convince the current holders to return funds (I guess a bribe would be involved) or to serve as expert witnesses to police. Both seem to have incredibly poor success rates on the face of them.

In researching CNCIntel / intelligence, it's very difficult to find much of what I would perceive as a legitimate footprint online. No one is talking about them, they have a very dubious trustpilot page and a handful of puff-piece articles written by the company themselves to promote what they claim to be able to do. They seem to have created a similarly dubious subreddit about two weeks ago.

Not a good sign amongst any of it.

They certainly seem to be an actually registered company, both in Washington and Israel, but I'm going to assume this is not too difficult to setup. They're either a scam, or are terrible at creating a reassuring image for themselves; I would be too, but I'm also not claiming to be a company that can help people in desperate hours of need.

So. Does anyone have any legitimate experience with the company, any of its known staff or at the least experience dealing with similar 'asset retrieval' firms? I'd made peace with the idea that my money was gone, but I'm in turmoil again because I can't get enough of a bearing to know that I'm in safe hands here or not.

2111;"I was looking into how the community feels about BlockFi and been reading your comments about it I’d just like to clear something up I believe a lot of people are not understanding about this.

I kept reading something along the lines of “why risk your BTC which appreciates on average 100% a year (in fiat) for an extra 6%” and that’s is just _incorrect_  on all fronts, let me make a case for it.

First of all let me mention about the “risk” which is completely overblown. BlockFi did not shutdown withdrawals even during the March dump of 2020, so short of a complete market collapse I don’t believe they would have any problems with liquidations. Furthermore, people lose cold storage BTC everyday and yet BlockFi has _never_ lost a single BTC so they’re way safer statistically speaking than cold storage.

Second let me mention the interest, the big point that a lot of you are missing is that interest is paid out IN KIND, you earn 6% not on your fiat you earn that on your BTC. So the argument about risking it all for 6% is just not valid.

Let’s say to make it easy that you deposit 1.6 BTC - at the end of the year you would have 0.1 BTC more than you had before so 1.7 BTC total. If BTC increases 100% thats 100% that you missed out, plus this interest compounds so it should be even higher than that once all is said and done. I’d say that returns like this are definitely worth the risk but that’s just me, I like small risk high rewards situation and this is one of those.

Lastly I’d urge you to stop thinking about fiat, that 100% price appreciation is meaningless, if you’re talking about stacking sats which is the only important thing you can do right now, BlockFi is the _best_ place to do that, you’re literally stacking sats passively without any action from you. Don’t miss out on this because of not your keys not your coins.";3

2127;"A recent podcast with Balaji Srinivasan (Tech founder, Former CTO of CoinBase, countless other credentials) some of the discussions may be familiar to some, but I found it incredibly interesting.

Note it covers other things too like the future of warfare, but it’s all worth a listen.

Most interesting I found relating to Bitcoin was discussing the threats of China/US/India.
China - The Great Firewall - Potentially blocking miners from the outside world. Could open and close to create some havoc as the chains merge. Could create a cat and mouse game between China/Bitcoin.  Outright ban, coupled with asset seizure to really kill it within the country.
US - Regulations, which could complicate it for businesses. No substantial impact, but it would slow growth.
India - Not sure how effective a ban would be, not nearly to the level China is in regards to firewall and enforcement. On the flip side could benefit greatly by embracing it.

He discusses Miami and their Mayor vs California. While cities/states are spending big to attract businesses, he’s tweeting and potentially redefining their future by being pro-crypto/tech.

2130;"Hypothetical scenario. Let’s say I take a $25,000 loan out on 1 BTC (assume currently at $50,000), with an entry price of $10,000. The loan is set at 50% loan-to-value and the bank holds custody of the bitcoin with an automatic liquidation on the collateral set up for -40% from the current price (say this is at $30,000 where it will liquidate). 

If I have the $25,000 cash from the loan, and we have a flash crash where my bitcoin is liquidated with bank taking 100% of the $30k proceeds, will I have to pay taxes on the gains from the theoretical $20k in gains on bitcoin ($30k - $10k)?

2141;"The best advice you will ever receive on any crypto subreddit is #1 -- """"Use a Passphrase with your Seed"""".

This is important for a number of reasons, such as.... If a friend, family, maintenance man, hardware wallet manufacturer (or malware spoofer), or even hacker who found your screenshot of your seed (even tho you were told not to screenshot your seed) gains access to your seed, then it's as good as gone.

Even a $5 wrench attack could beat your seed out of you, which could point to a """"dummy"""" wallet with 0.002 BTC or whatever in it. Little would the attacker know that you could be using MULTIPLE passphrases with that seed, each providing access to a completely unique wallet.

This is another benefit -- organization. You can have a main wallet passphrase you can occasionally disperse smaller sums to your wife, kids for spending money or what have you. All of you share the same seed, yet only the """"master"""" would really be able to gain access to the master wallet.

Such an easy, easy thing to do to protect your coins with what is essentially a mostly memorable passphrase. I know that people don't want to talk about """"collision"""" possibilities of 12 and 24 word seeds, but if ONE person or app in 100,000 years were to randomly generate a seed that points to a wallet with a substantial amount of coin in it... and there were no passphrase... that coin is also as good as gone.

Protect yourself with a passphrase, and for the love of God, PLEASE stop saying """"seed phrase"""". That shit is so confusing when there is a seed &amp; a passphrase. Perhaps passphrase should be renamed to password, which many apps also use... but until then... Use a passphrase WITH your seed.";3

2151;"Supercycle - a term which is gaining popularity these days, applies to commodities . Basically what happens is surge in demand, which current supply struggles to cover, causes prices to sky-rocket from being under-valued to highly over-valued.
In my opinion Bitcoin and its' four-year cycle is the best example. The main event of the cycle is halving (halving the rewards of mining the Bitcoin ), which is causing supply-shock and aftermath in the form of speculative bubble.

I strongly believe we are about to see a supercycle in Uranium in the following years. Spot price of that commodity is right now under-valued to such an extent Cameco ( one of its largest global providers) is buying it from the spot market in order to meet the contracts and keeping some of its mines closed (waiting for the prices to rise). Currently there are about 440 active nuclear reactors and 50 being constructed (more than 10% of the actual number) mainly in China and India (respectively 16 and 6 as of March 2021). Interesting pair, isn't it? If the rest of the world does not want to stay behind they will have no choice but to follow that direction.

Therefore your return on investment is the same as well, because the ratio is always kept no matter the initial amount of zeroes for a unit (1 BTC).

However, the unit bias aka our instinctual need for completion puts us off buying because we cannot obtain 1 full BTC now as easily as we could have years ago.

However, investing now is as fruitful as it was the last few years and the next few years for the sole reason the ratio or ROI stays more or less the same regardless of the initial price.

when i tried to transfer them to my wallet etoro told me i cant do that , i have to wait 60 days because i bought them via PayPal. So i just sold them again and took my money back.I was wondering if i could just do the same again but instead with bank transfer to be able to transfer them without any delay. They said there is no delay when you are paying with bank transfer but the examples they list in the FAQ make me confused.

 

Here are some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your first deposit was $200 via credit  card. After a month, you made a further deposit of $1,000 via bank  transfer. You opened a Bitcoin position with $1,200, but now it is only  worth $800. You can transfer the position now because the current value  of the position is lower than the amount deposited via bank transfer.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You are a Bronze user and your first  deposit was $400 via bank transfer. After a month, you made a further  deposit of $600 via credit card. You opened a Bitcoin position with  $1,000. You can transfer the position, but only after 60 days have  passed since your first deposit (because you are a Bronze user and a  credit card was used to deposit).

(1) Let's say somebody bought 1 BTC a year ago.  Transfers it off exchange to his own wallet.

(2) Just yesterday, this person decides to buy $100 of BTC every Monday, but keep these DCA investments on the exchange to save on multiple transaction fees.

MY QUESTIONS.....

(1) Now that the FIFO and LIFO transactions are technically separated (First In is in personal wallet, Last In is on exchange)... If said person spends from either wallet or exchange, is this coin really distinguishable??   Because if they were in the same wallet they wouldn't be....  So would one need to make sure to spend, sell from one account or the other, or do all your coins just need to be recorded correctly / consistently as wholly owned by you? 
 Hope this is understandable....

(2) Which method would be better for this person if they want to keep as much BTC as possible, with as little fiat as possible... But *might* need to pull some money out in a few months??

I would think FIFO, because that way you don't have to pay short term capital gains, right

But OTOH, I was just thinking about this.  If this hypothetical person puts in $100/WK for 10 weeks, then needs to pull out $1,000... Even tho he'd have to pay more capital gains tax (10 weeks definitely short-term), his gain would be a lot less if he would need to withdraw some, since he's obviously riding a tight rope keeping 99% in BTC and only 1% or even less of possible in fiat.

2200;"This is a good problem to have question. Throwaway account due the nature of this post.

I have been talking about bitcoins for the better part of a decade. I'd often have conversations with friends and family and coworkers about this subject (including my, now boss, but then co-worker years ago). For a while when bitcoin was in the news my coworkers knew I was the 'bitcoin buy' to talk to about it. Back in early days people would ask """"How many bitcoins do you have?"""" etc. Luckily, I never answered that question.

However, now with the price movements over the last several months and the just the general amount of press it has received, I am starting to realize people's attitude toward me has started to shift. In 2017, I mentioned perhaps after too much wine, that we had """"made"""" like 10k in one day to my mother-in-law and then the other day I said something was expensive and she replied to the effect of """"what does price matter to you?"""" and so on. Coworkers same story. In a meeting the other day my boss introduced me """"the guy that's just working for fun, because he is a bitcoin millionaire"""". Of course I joke it off.

I do not want to flaunt my wealth, and I think that in another world, if I had made a ton on general investing for instance, sure I might have discussed investing with friends, but they wouldn't have known I had made this much because I wouldn't have done much to show it. Maybe take an early or partial retirement, but I am keeping my same car and house and what not and I'd prefer for lots of reasons, mainly that people are really weird about money, that anyone but especially friends and family don't know exactly to what extent our net worth has grown (obviously the taxing authorities in our country would have some idea when and if I sell for fiat).

My wife and I have adopted a 'steer the conversation away from bitcoin' strategy for now. But I \*do\* want to talk about them. 

I'm thinking some here are the same boat. I am wondering if anyone has found any serious strategies to """"clawback"""" people's perception of them, that doesn't involve outright lying, or has that ship sailed?

I would theoretically be having the BTC sent to my mobile wallet, but I'm not sure how I would exchange this into real money - and I was wondering if it would be possible to link my wallet to CashApp (or just send the money to the CashApp wallet), sell the $5000 worth of BTC on CashApp, and then withdraw from a linked bank account. Or, is it possible to simply exchange the $5000 BTC to PayPal without going through an actual exchange service like Coinbase or Paxful? If neither of these are very good, in the future I would probably make a Coinbase account and just use that.

2218;"Let me preface this by saying I'm a complete noob in this area. I invested in bitcoin back in 2017 with some spare money I had and I've been holding since.

Now I don't need that money so I won't be selling anytime soon but I've been thinking. What's the end game here? When does one actually sell? Will that time even ever come? 

I've heard of many stories and I'm sure you all have as well about people selling ridiculous amounts of bitcoin for a pizza or something similar and how those are worth in the millions now. Will it ever truly reach a point where it holds its same value long enough for people to not find it a waste to spend it? 

Like I personally have thought about selling a bit here and there to buy a few things in the past but there's always been that thought in the back of my head telling me I'd be making a huge mistake... and it turns out it was right, because its gone up since. 

Seems to me like we're stuck in this endless loop of buying and never selling, for the most part, and it will continue rising even if very slowly at times, so it will always be a waste to sell. 

Please let me know your thoughts about all this and maybe help me understand some misconceptions I might have here!

2233;"It is no doubt ideal to hold real bitcoin when you want to be secured by a the worlds strongest decentralized blockchain. However, if you are also trying to speculate on the price could GBTC have gone from being a terrible deal to a great deal?

As you likely know GBTC has gone from high premiums to steep discounts. As of close yesterday GBTC closed with a 8.2% discount to assets. GBTC does have a very high annual fee of 2%. However, I think it is very reasonable to think that over the next two years GBTC could transition into an ETF eroding the discount. Not many exchanges will give you a discount on Bitcoin. 

Of course there are many limitations such as you can't easily transfer it, lend it, or have the keys. However, I think it is not completely unreasonable to think that the discount on GBTC could actually become a benefit for owners of it. 

To be clear I own shares of GBTC and trade it in client accounts. So I have a vested interest in it doing well. I would certainly hold real bitcoin if that was something available in the environment I work in. I also hold real bitcoin too.";4

2237;"So lets say the worst happens and some of these big funds are forced to liquidate their holdings as they're over leveraged on cheap margin (during the past year the banks increased their lending to increase liquidity during the pandemic, that money went to funds who bought in at market lows causing the stock market to rise). The people who lent them money are afraid of a downturn in the market that would lose them their principal, and are now trying to get it back at .75 or less on the dollar and not end up as bag holders who didn't get any of their loaned money back. When the lenders liquidate the funds to get their money back they'll sell the funds holdings at a discount (this is the cents on the dollar), tanking the markets in large block sales (ex: Viacom, Discovery).

During the housing crash the Government jumped in to bail out the banks (the bagholders of junk housing bonds), the DTCC (rule 2021- 004) said they're not planning on doing that (bailing out the bagholders). Leaving the Government as a possible lifeline. 

If the government tries to bail the lenders who didn't get their money out, they'll make the dollar less valuable and force even more printing causing a downward spiral leading to hyperinflation and a weak dollar with very little buying power.

If the government doesn't bail out the bagholding banks they could fail, also tanking the market. This would lead to a downturn in the market until those with cash reserves will buy in at huge discounts (&gt;90% in some cases).

Does this mean Bitcoin is the savior in either situation here? Laws of supply and demand say no. How many large institutional investors would cash out their bitcoin to USD to cover their other assets? Unless the DTCC starts allowing you to buy shares in companies directly with bitcoin, this event could also bring Bitcoins value down at least in the short term. 

There are some BIG assumptions here.

2241;"Net worth across today's all asset classes:

Gold + coins/notes + electronic bank ledgers = $10t + $10t + $80t = $100t USD

Real Estate = $200t USD

Equities = $100t USD

Bonds = $100t USD

Gold + coins/notes + bank ledgers  are all directly replaceable by Bitcoins as a store of value and a medium of exchange, so we will assume a **30% conversion rate** from these to Bitcoin. Think of it as people selling  their fiat for Bitcoin and HODL (which is what we all do here on this forum)

Real Estate, Equities and Bonds are different asset classes in comparison to Bitcoin but they still have store of value function baked in their prices, so we will assume a modest **5% conversion rate** from these to Bitcoin. These are from the people selling their houses, stocks and bonds to put into Bitcoin, might involve institutional purchasers like pension fund which is swapping out highly priced stocks and low yielding bonds to buy Bitcoin.

$100t x 30% + $400t x 5% = $50t, that's the market cap for Bitcoin after having absorbed the value from all other asset classes

This is just unfair. A lot of people missed the train. Therefore, I am somehow not okay with that. Also I am not okay with institutions buying bitcoin. I wish an altcoin like ethereum would be the ‘new’ bitcoin but then i thought, that the same thoughts i just applied on bitcoin might apply to ethereum in 10 years. 
I just don’t like the fact that a few whales could gather together and sell all their bitcoins leading to a crash.
I really see the advantages of cryptocurrency in general but I just don’t like bitcoin.

I would like to hear your opinion on my thoughts, maybe you could clearify that i have wrong information. I’m not someone who is sad/angry because he missed the train. Would really appreciate a fruitful discussion!";3

Not to mention Bitcoin doesn't need me to actually physically go to work and do work and endure office politics  9-6 every weekday. Bitcoin just needs you to buy it, and sit there, and it will earn for you.

2267;"Hi All, 
I’m a month into my Bitcoin journey and have jumped in feet first and bought some. 

The next step of my journey was to decide where to hodl it for the foreseeable future. I looked at the Trezor T which I nearly committed to. But then I stumbled across multisig with x2 Trezor’s, which I felt more comfortable with in case I lost/misplaced the single hardware wallet (Apparently 4 million Bitcoin have been lost say the YouTube stats). I’m still keen on this solution. But then...

I stumbled across Ledn.io and after a fair bit of due diligence they seem to check out using Bitgo as custody and very open about how they make money whilst securing (not insuring I know) their clients money and I was satisfied. I can even see my Bitcoin on the blockchain with their proof of reserves so I know it’s not been misused. I really like that the CEO is such a public figure on YouTube so if it all goes wrong we know who to blame. But he comes across very well. And the business model is pretty low risk assuming Bitcoin doesn’t go to 0 but at that point it won’t matter.

I’ve done a reasonable amount of research, and yes I’ve heard the saying ‘not your keys, not your crypto’. But the other-side of the coin is that exchanges, Ledn, Blockfi etc spend a ton on their security right? And Mount Gox was a long time ago.

Anyhow I’ve put all my Bitcoin in Ledn.io and wanted to sense check it against some more experienced levelheaded coiners. So please let me know what you all do?";4

2271;"Hello to all,

Is there a way to properly export the private key of the entire HD wallet generated through Bitcoin-Qt?

I tried both like this:

1. `getnewaddress`
2. `dumpprivkey` *step1-key*
3. `importprivkey` *step2-key*

&amp;#x200B;

Which like this:

1. `dumpwallet`
2. Make Blank Wallet &gt; Yes
3. `importprivkey` *Master\_Private\_Key\_ (from\_ """"dumpwallet"""")*

&amp;#x200B;

The result of the first method was that the imported wallet reported """"*HD key generation is* ***disabled***""""; while the result of the second method was the error message: """"*Invalid private key encoding (code -5)*"""".

You also probably noticed that we removed oil and gold. In their place, we added 1) bitcoin and 2) a """"flex"""" spot, which will allow us to showcase any security—whether it's a tech stock, oil, or dogecoin—that made an interesting move the previous day.

2285;"I've read a good bit about Bitcoin, but there is one question that bothers me a lot: 

**""""Bitcoin fixes inflation"""" &lt;- is this really true?** 

*1. Fed conducts monetary policy*

In the economy as it is right now, the federal reserve controls the money supply using open market operations (monetary policy). If it wants to increase the money supply, they buy bonds from banks (gives banks more money) If it wants to decrease the money supply, they sell bonds to the banks (takes money from banks). 

AFAIK, This is how the Fed """"prints"""" money. By buying bonds from banks. Not using a printing press. 

*2. Monetary policy helps mitigate recession &amp; control inflation*

AFAIK, we need this monetary policy because it helps control unemployment and inflation throughout the business cycle. There's a classic explanation from Ray Dalio's youtube vid on economic machine. Businesses need loans, banks give out loans, the leverage stimulates growth, economy expands. At some point, businesses need to pay back loans, and business growth stifles, economy contracts, potentailly to recession or panic.  

If businesses and banks start using unsustainable amount of loans. They increase the interest rate (reduces incentive for taking out loans, therefore reduces money supply, reduces inflation) and limits expansion. The fed can also stimulate growth in a recession by lowering interest rates (increases money supply), and mitigating the contraction. 

*3. Currently, we equate growth to inflation* 

As we've seen, growth comes from loans. loans create 'new money' that businesses can use for growth. Creating this 'new money' inevitably increase the money supply, and leads to inflation. 

AFAIK, the only way economy grows with deflation is if the country's production, usually through some innovation, creates more goods than is demanded, and purchasing power of the currency increases. But this is an ideal scenario, usually is not the case in a lot of countries. Most times, businesses need loans to grow. 

*4. Bitcoin is deflationary.* 

Yes, you can't create bitcoin out of thin air like the fed buys bonds from banks. The increase in supply will asymptotically reach an end, and there will be limited supply. 

Limited supply + demand in the money(btc) market  = deflation. 

**Expanding money supply is needed for economic growth, but Bitcoin has limited supply...**

5. Bitcoin as a """"solution"""" to inflation (ignoring the tech or commodity view, just currency)

It's true that bitcoin is not deflationary. But this deflation seems different from the natural positive deflation the economy wants. The 'positive' deflation comes from the ecnomy's growth in production, and where businesses produce so much that they start lowering prices and increasing purchase power of the currency. On the other hand, Bitcoin's deflation is from its limited supply unrelated to economic growth.

Yes, current inflation sucks because increase in money supply devalues currency while appreciating asssets. This reduces purchasing power of the lower income class that owns less assets and enriches the upper class that owns a lot of assets. This sucks. Bitcoin does prevent this from happening which is good. But if money supply can not expand, how could the government stimulate economic growth? 

***6. Central question:*** *can there by economic growth without expanding the bitcoin supply?* 

There will inevitably be a period of economic slowdown where production slows and unemployment rises. If there is no way to incentivize loans in the bitcoin system (unlike the fed who can lower interest rates), there will be no solution to recover from a recession. 

**Conclusion/TLDR:** In a decentralized system of wallets and bitcoins with no banks, and where there is no way to incentivize increase or decrease of money supply, there will be no business cycle of expansion and contraction. If we cannot create credit, economy cannot be driven forward. Then how can bitcoin be sustainable as a global currency?";3

2290;"Not investment advice. At all.

There's three main reasons I've determined people hfsp. For those that don't know, this means have fun staying poor. This is not ONLY money...this is also a state of mind.

1. Risk avoidance. You can have hfsp in $, but you can also hfsp in friends, dating, health, and overall happiness. I have 2 friends who literally refuse to make any real attempts at dating, and then wonder why they don't have relationships. I don't hate to break it to you-life has risks. Any surefire or easy bet is a fast path to the poor house. You know who I think buys bitcoin when it's """"safe"""". The people at $500,000. In this climate of massive prin$ing, I believe saving tons of cash is a sure fire way to poverty. Avoiding all risk is the biggest risk of all.
2. No real plans. Do you have a plan? I sure as hell don't for much of my life. I better write it down. You know why gamblers lose? Because their real plan is to leave the casino with no money left. Write your goals down. I'm over the bitcoin maximalist stuff coming from people who try to shame those who sell. Some people in crypto have $10,000,000 and no family-they can take the massive swings. Other's can't. Whether your goal is to get to $10,000 or $100,000,000-write your goals down, and how you expect to get there. Most of my friends who have not bought homes have not done so because of lack of $-in fact, they have the highest paying jobs, the most saved, etc...they have no plan.
3. Don't be a victim-educate yourself. Do you think you are smart? I'm sure as hell not. Most of us are average, and many below average, thinkers. You want to make $? Go after the people that have real $$. Understand what it took. Ask questions. Don't be fake. Ask real questions. Go on twitter. Look up videos on youtube. Look at the pros and cons. Don't try to be a smart ass....try to educate yourself.

And maybe...you don't have to be HFSP.";3

The only way to recorrect the balance was to incentivize nodes to operate and decrease the centralization affect of mining. I was told constantly that I was wrong because miners would not want to hurt the system if they wanted to profit from it.  

I beleive user activated soft fork is the first step to say to the miners that it's time for the centralization and power plays to stop. When lightning network gets running on Bitcoin, and less fees are ran through miners, this will tell them that it's too much. If they want more profit, then they will need to run either better hardware or dial down the difficulty level so the power consumption needed to mine is less.  

This is how we can bring low-power consumption mining back and merge wallets and miners together again.  

If someone decides they rather use a liteweight or pruned wallet, that's fine, they just wont receive those bits, but the service provider node can so they can support the wallets.  

Return the balance to Bitcoin and let it grow the way it was supposed to do. UASF now please.";3

From the bitcoin perspective it offers a secure storage of bitcoin keys on a secure microcontroller with hardware crypto, all operations are pin protected and a press of a touch button is required to confirm a transaction.

1928;"Ok. I have an understanding of how Digital Currencies are being taxed(as a commodity) in the United States. I am curious as to how some of you have handled this daunting task. 

I have lost a lot of money being dumb currency trading and would technically be owed tenfold more than I would be required to pay in for my gains. However, I am turning this around after years of learning how to handle this beast and am starting to become worried about taxes. 

I plan on waiting(not sure if good idea) to pay taxes until there is an easier way to do so. I am asking if this is a good idea. 

I have losses from 4 years ago that I never recorded and figured if the IRS wanted me to pay taxes(if I owe any) They can help me figure out how much they owe me.. 

So at this point I am just going to wait unless I would happen to get extremely lucky with someones dumb market buy that netted me a few dozen bitcoin. Then I wouldn't care about what I owed and could mentally write off all my previous losses.

Biggest thing that erks me is, to hell I will pay taxes on something when currently my losses far outweigh my gains.

In preparation for sending the entire balance to my current wallet, I used the old version of MultiBit HD to send a small deposit to my current wallet. This has been in limbo for quite a while (about a week), as it would seem that the version of MultiBit I was running did not send a sufficient transaction fee.

I have a Coinbase account that is currently holding a small amount of bitcoin inside it's vault (everything else is in my hardware wallet) and nothing else (though I did use it to originally buy my bitcoin).

Anyways, earlier today I got an email and message on login to coinbase to enable 2FA - except I already have had 2FA enabled since day 1 (using authy). 

Also, when I went to log on coinbase, it showed the 2FA screen normally.


I don't know what to do - when I go to setup 2FA via the coinbase message on login, it shows another QR code. I'm afraid that if I set this up, that it will invalidate my current 2FA/cause my account to be locked/lose access to my account.

TL,DR: Coinbase sent me an email telling me to enable 2FA when I've had 2FA enabled for the entire time I've had the account. Glitch or did some hacker mess with my 2FA?

1962;The stagnation as a result of the scaling debate impasse will result in Bitcoin getting surpassed by Ethereum and other coins. Maintaining the status quo is no longer an option, but at this point it doesn't look like any protocol upgrades can be achieved without a chain split.

1968;"Hi everyone,
 
My name is Oliver and I am a graduate student at the Technical University of Munich. For my final thesis I am doing research on cryptocurrency mining and have put together a survey to better understand the motivations and behavior of miners.
 
If you have mined Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin/Dash/Monero or any other cryptocurrency with your own hardware (not just through cloud mining) in the past, or are still doing so today, you are welcome to participate in the survey. The survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. All participants who complete the survey are eligible to enter a raffle for the chance to win 20 EUR worth of BTC or ETH. Three winners will be drawn at random on June 30th and 20 EUR worth of BTC or ETH will be sent to each of the winners’ wallets on the same day.
 
The survey is located here:
[https://ww3.unipark.de/uc/cryptominingsurvey/](https://ww3.unipark.de/uc/cryptominingsurvey/)

All survey responses are collected only for the purpose of my final thesis and will be treated confidentially.
 
If you have any questions about the study, I am happy to answer them. You can PM me, post them here, or address them at the end of the survey.
 
Thank you for your help! I am happy to share the results of the study with you once the survey is completed.

1969;"I empathise with the sentiment behind BIP148 and would like to get Segwit activated ASAP.  However, I run a full node and I'm on the fence about supporting BIP148.  I'll explain my reasons, but feel free to push me over the fence with convincing arguments... ;-)

I don't think we should embark in any risky forks until there is overwhelming consensus among honest actors.  As things stand right now, there's even a few notable Core developers (like Greg Maxwell) who are not behind BIP148, not to mention plenty of big players in the ecosystem who aren't either.
    
Note that I said """"honest actors"""".  I think we'll only achieve that overwhelming consensus when it becomes 100% clear to everyone that Jihan &amp; Co have been acting in bad faith, and that all reasonable attempts at finding a compromise have been exhausted.

Therefore, as a matter of strategy, I think UASF supporters should first propose a soft-fork which kills covert ASICboost and nothing else.  All outcomes from this proposal are positive: if it gets rejected by Jihan &amp; Co, then their deception will have been exposed in the most vivid way possible, and support for a UASF will skyrocket; if it gets activated, then I'm pretty sure that soon after Jihan &amp; Co will find themselves much more friendly towards Segwit. To save face they'll probably say the change of heart was caused by Litecoin demonstrating that Segwit is safe, or something along these lines...
    
Finally, I would like for the adults in the room to step up and propose a scaling compromise that takes into account the interests of all the parties in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Remember that besides end users, the ecosystem also includes exchanges, miners, developers, and merchants.

I think that Segwit2Mb is a reasonable starting point. I would support it if some the technical shortcomings were to be fixed, the schedule was not so aggressive (I'd prefer 9 months to a year before the hard-fork, with a slow ramp up to 2MB blocks afterwards), and most importantly, if the proposal was fixed and blessed by Core developers.

I just finished the alpha version of [www.BitcoinVoice.com](https://www.bitcoinvoice.com)

Each vote is weighted by the balance of the associated address.  Proof of Stake without protocol changes! :P

1998;"A bunch of economically significant participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have signed an agreement to ostensibly run code that would hard fork away from Bitcoin Core code later this fall.  Why?  And what will happen?


At the time of signing the agreement, the economically significant participants (some with hundreds of millions of USD on the line) must surely each have been aware that attempting to enforce a contentious hard fork would lead to severe risk of two chains, attacks, disruption, confusion, and lasting damage to Bitcoin's reputation, value and usage.


The participants must all now continue to be aware that attempting to ram through a contentious hard fork based on rushed code produced by a small handful of developers in a semi-closed process, with almost no time for testing and coordination with other ecosystem participants, will quite possibly result in a colossal clusterfuck.


Thus - provided that the participants have not been fully co-opted by forces hostile to Bitcoin's increased adoption, and provided that they are not otherwise no longer motivated by rational pursuit of their own economic self-interest - one would have to conclude that, regardless of their public statements or commitments, the participants will not be willing to actually move forward with such an unreasonably risky hard fork.


If so, as an uninformed outside observer, how then could one explain the fact of these economically significant participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem publicly pledging to honor an agreement that appears to commit them to a path heading directly into this unreasonable risk?


For a large fraction of the parties to the agreement, it seems reasonable to infer that signing the agreement simply represents pragmatic temporary signalling to move past a political deadlock, with the unspoken but clearly rational intent of shifting their stance on the timing and deployment of the 2x block size hard fork portion of the pledge, after Segwit activation, based on the obvious challenges a rushed non-unanimous hardfork would pose.


However, it also seems that some of the economically significant participants, in particular some of the miners, may have signed the agreement fully intending to run Segwit2x code, and may find it very difficult to explicitly back away from this pledge, either due to external pressures and/or being unwilling to lose face.  


If those miners indeed earnestly follow through on their pledge, did the other agreement participants miscalculate?  The prospect of substantial hashpower actually running Segwit2x code after Segwit activation would, at first glance, seem to imply the real chance of a contentious hard fork occurring this fall.


On further consideration, what seems most likely to happen is that the miners will indeed run Segwit2x code, and on the surface meet their publicly stated commitment, but those miners will simply set their **soft limit** such that they continue to mine segwit blocks that small enough to be valid according to Bitcoin Core code.  


It would be easy to justify the soft limit as a temporary measure to allow time for """"further testing"""" and adoption of """"Segwit2x-compatible code"""" by more of the other nodes who variously were or were not party to the agreement.


After a couple years of further work and research, a hard fork to some form of larger block size might independently be developed, tested and accepted by Bitcoin core; in the meantime, soft limits would continue to be used as a means for miners actually continuing to run Segwit2x code to maintain compatibility with the vastly more prevalent majority of nodes continuing to run battle tested, well-maintained Bitcoin core code.


If this theory proves true, there may be many moments of fear and uncertainty between now and this fall, with plenty of posturing and sound and fury, and the Bitcoin price could dip substantially at points - but in reality those dips might be some of the last opportunities to add meaningful amounts of Bitcoin to one's holdings before the next phase of 2nd layer scaling solutions starts unfolding, and the value of Bitcoin takes off on another upleg, never to look back.

I find a very interesting presentation named: 

**BREAKING bitcoin hardware wallets**

this is the intro:
""""The security of your bitcoins rests entirely in the security of your private key. Bitcoin hardware wallets help protect against software-based attacks to recover or misuse your key. However, hardware attacks on these wallets are not as well studied. In 2015, Jochen Hoenicke was able to extract the private key from a TREZOR using a simple power analysis technique. While that vulnerability was patched, he suggested the Microcontroller on the TREZOR, which is also the same on the KeepKey, may be vulnerable to additional side channel attacks.

In this presentation we will quickly overview fault injection techniques, timing, and power analysis methods using the Open Source Hardware tool, the ChipWhisperer. We then show how to apply these techniques to the STM32F205 which is the MCU on the Trezor and KeepKey. Lastly, we will present our findings of a timing attack vulnerability and conclude with software and hardware recommendations to improve bitcoin hardware wallets. We will show and share our tools and methods to help you get started in breaking your own wallet!

Yesterday afternoon, [/u/thisisforyounow](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisforyounow) started a bit of a treasure hunt over in Mountain View, CA.

I've been playing with bitcoin for a few months now, and happened to stumble upon the thread advertising the start of the hunt.

My sister and I headed over this morning, arriving when it opened at 10am, and searched for about 3 hours. Plenty of other people there looking, trying to be inconspicuous about peeking behind placards and the such.

We tried plenty to solve clues but didn't have many leads, so, like the many others there, our search was a bruteforce quest. We went through the gallery at least two dozen times, until we finally realized the potential of the undersides of a few benches.

The museum is fascinating, and we hadn't been since we first moved here, and it was a great experience.

2017;"Here it goes:
In the early days of Bitcoin the was no bip32 and addresses were generated from random (underived) private keys.
The downside of this approach is that over time the number of private keys grows and you need to constantly update your backup file to include newly generated keys. That means you can not """"backup once and forget"""". User-unfriendly approach. Also, it was as obvious as 2x2 that backup file with private keys *should be encrypted* with a *strong password* and the same in case of printed QR with encoded key. And as we are dealing with potential offline brute-force attack, the strong password is nothing less secure than diceware generated &gt;=6 word pass (this is as well user-unfriendly).

## Printed QR
This sheet of paper is vulnerable to fire/water and no less importantly: lost.
So the good approach for the printed key is to store it in a fire resistant safe encrypted with a strong password.
- Not something average person can do
- Does not work for daily wallets

## File with private keys
Suitable for daily wallets but should be updated after each transaction. blockchain.info used to provide this option: you could attach Dropbox or receive emails with updated backup file after each transaction. Your keys are safe as long as you remember your password and it is *strong*.

In my opinion, this backup technique was the closest to the most secure and user friendly solution for daily wallets; strong password is something average user still can't understand, however.

## Two concepts emerged over time to address the above stated issues:
- BIP32 for deterministic key generation
- Hardware wallets as cheap and secure replacement for expensive safes

So nowadays we do have a way to *backup once and forget* but almost nobody (including me, probably) understands how to do that the right way.

Let's look at Trezor security model. I still need to backup my seed to a paper recovery card. Am I the only one who finds this practice insane? And the same goes for *every Bitcoin wallet out there*. Every software wallet app tells me to back my 12 words in a *safe place*, but no one of them specifies what a safe place actually is. And for most users the backup goes as follows:
1. Write down 12 words on a sheet of paper
2. Put this sheet of paper somewhere (in a desk/book ect)
Because what else can be more secure than a sheet of paper? 
**Be your own bank, fuck yeah**.

I have been trying to figure out the solution to this dilemma that is suitable for most potential crypto-users who are not tech-savvy and here is the scheme. It relies on smartphones as I can't imagine most people using something different to transact in Bitcoin.

Please note that It hardly relies on Apple hardware and ecosystem. I am sorry to all android users out there but here are my thoughts about why this is so important:
1. Android is a cybersecurity nightmare. **A pro-user can tune his android to be secure as well as to choose the good model from the market**. **Average user is the one who never receives security updates, installs shitty software and likely just bought a fancy new device from china that is factory rooted**. Hell. I don't want this thread to be about Android vs Apple, but if you have a solution that does not rely on seed-on-a-paper backup I will listen to it with pleasure.
2. On the other hand we have Apple with their secure-enclaved iPhones and iCloud Keychain. To understand security of iCloud Keychain one needs to go [here](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Krstic.pdf) TL;DR once iCloud Keychain was initiated and rolled out to the public it is secure as rock (provided that initiation was not compromised: very unlikely cause leakage will cost Apple it's face). To understand the security of iPhone with secure enclave one needs to go [here](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) and [here](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Mandt-Demystifying-The-Secure-Enclave-Processor.pdf). TL;DR is that such an iPhone with latest iOS has unprecedented level of security that is light years ahead of competitors. That said, nothing is ideal and iPhone has it's weaknesses, but in practice there is no known successful attack on record out there. Think of iPhone [+software wallet that utilizes keychain (not iCloud)] like a **hardware wallet by itself** (with separate hardware and operating system running under the hood) that is manufactured by a huge company (means many audits their products for security) can't say the same for Bitcoin hardware wallet manufacturers.

## How a wallet should help people keep their bitcoins in **secure** AND **accessible** manner (big IMO)

### During the first launch a wallet should:

1. Generate a 12-word mnemonic. I consider it the best practice (and a privilege of a smartphone) to use additional sources of entropy like a feed from sensors (touch screen, accelerometer, gyroscope and with certain permission: camera). No hardware wallet out there relies on additional entropy, and to date, only few software wallets utilize this technic ( [Bither](https://bither.net/) is one of them)
2. Ask a user to enter emoji-pass that consist of 8 emojis from a special emoji-list (😝). Like a word list for diceware passwords / wallet mnemonic, emoji-list consists of only special emoticons that are easily distinguishable and represent well known meanings, that said: no all shades of emotions, no gender/race related emojis etc. The alfa-version of such a list is available [here](https://pastebin.com/RPXhd0nT). These 8 emojis are used as a """"passphrase"""" during BIP39 binary seed derivation. After that stage, mnemonic and emoji-pass are stored inside **local** keychain.

Some clarification: provided that an attacker knows 12 word mnemonic, he needs to compute:
- 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 (312 emojis from an emoji-list in the power of 8) different binary seeds (each takes 2048 rounds of sha512)
- 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 addresses (one [ex. external] address from BIP44 notation for each binary seed). Provided that it's guaranteed from a wallet source that the first (or i-th) external address will be shown to user and potentially used for transaction. That could be hardened by using a random i-th external address from some (even small) range
- Compare the above set of addresses with all addresses from a blockchain to determine whether correct seed was generated)
As far as I know, 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 combinations is considered a safe for password. In our case we have an additional anti brute-force measure (2048 round of sha512 + comparison to addresses from blockchain. I would be glad for some realworld info (math) regarding speed of bruteforce in that particular case, but I dare to say that even if attacker has access to a supercomputer or a powerful botnet, user will have time to transfer bitcoins in another wallet).

### During sometime after user is onboard
A wallet should give an advice to enable iCloud Keychain storage for 12 word mnemonic. There should be a foolproof system that will 1. Let the user memorize an emoji-pass by providing a simple trainer that asks to enter pass many times and in different forms through some period of time 2. Examines the user before the mnemonic is finally backed up into iCloud Keychain.
Of course, user is advised to set a strong password for his Apple ID and enable 2FA with an explanation that clarifies importance of these steps.
Please notice that emoji-pass never leaves the device. Moreover, it can be stored in such a manner that system deletes it after some period of time and/or after reboot. In that way a user will more likely memorize his emoji-pass  forever (or notice the problem before some big amount of bitcoins is in game).

### What's good about emoji-pass
- The character set is ~30 times bigger than numeric (pins used by many wallet providers as additional security) and ~3 times bigger than all-space set
- Being picture representation of some meanings (words) emoji-sequence can be memorized with much better success and ease than word-sequence. Additionally, they are extremely popular around the globe and hiding the 12-word unlocalized mnemonic behind the scenes increases the user-friendliness of the software dramatically.
The threat model shifts from: """"backup your fucking mnemonic wherever you want, it's not our problem"""" to """"set-up one good password plus 2FA for your Apple ID, memorize these fancy emojis and you are safe to go and switch devices as often as you need""""
Even if user does not have a good password and 2FA, **he will receive a notification** that his account is compromised and will have enough time to secure his bitcoins.

I am  open for criticism, but I do need to know how the community perceive this dilemma of wallet back up.

Thank you!

These altclients are most likely backed by a large entity such as a banking cartel or state sponsorship, with the goal to divide, conquer and control Bitcoin.  

Bitcoin's security comes from the lack of ability to quickly change or duress the network.  **No altcoin/fork of Bitcoin can say that they truly work as a decentralized exchange of value.  Bitcoin is  the still the only """"bitcoin"""" and always will be**

2029;"I recently got into an argument with someone spewing referral links and touting Genesis (and BitConnect, smh) so I decided to run the numbers the best I could for his situation.

**tl;dr** You will have a return of investment of -38.6% (yes, negative) before your contract is cancelled because of increased network difficulty.


**Methodology**

* I'm ignoring price fluctuations in BTC. I'm assuming that it doesn't drop enough to invalidate the contract. This is a very important point because a lot of people use this in their argument, but there's no reason you need to mine for this, you can just buy and HODL.
* I'm using CoinWarz for the profitability calculator, and I'm using the upfront contract cost as hardware cost (it's a one time capital expense), and distribute the maintenance fee as an electricity cost - shown more clearly later.
* I assume that network difficulty doubles every 6 months. This is based on looking at BitcoinWisdom. I haven't been able to find a better/more precise indicator, but if this is relatively close it makes the math very convenient.
* I'm using an average over time. If a value changes linearly over time (network difficulty) and you know the values of the endpoints, you can say that the value of the each individual point in that time period is the average between the endpoints. More illustratively, if I am earning $1/day today, and I believe I will be earning $0.50/day in one year, I can say that on average my earnings over the next year are $0.75/day.


**The Numbers**

I started w/ 16.5 TH/s because that is how much the other person said he had.
At today's rates, it costs $2,175 to buy 16.5TH/s.
Maintenance rate is $0.00028/GHs, so maintenance fee is $4.62 fee per day or $0.1925/hr.
I inputted this CoinWarz calculator w/ the $2,175 as the hardware costs, I used power and power costs of 192.5 Watts and $0.001/Wh, which equals the same $0.1925/hr maintenance fee

*Initial (read: the one Genesis wants you to look at but is actually misleading) verdict:* 228 days to break even.
**NOTE:** this is really important because some people seem to forget this. An investment in Genesis cannot be withdrawn. It's money gone. So after 228 days you haven't doubled your money or even earned $2,175, you have $0. You spent $2,175 and then you got it back. $0 total. 

Now, stepping it up, I introduce the effect of network difficulty. From my methodology, we assume that the difficulty doubles every six months. That means that you're making (after maintenance fee) the full $9.54/day on day one, but at month six it's $2.46. **Wait a minute, that's not half!!** I made this mistake too! Of the initial $9.54, you're earning $14.16 but paying a maintenance fee of $4.62 - so after network difficulty doubles you earn $7.08/day but still have to pay the same $4.62 maintenance fee (your Gemini contract includes nothing about them ever having to provide a better maintenance fee ever). 

The network difficulty continues to increase and around the 9 month mark (to be precise, once network difficulty increases 3.065 times or day 280 of your contract) you're earning $4.62/day and your maintenance fee is $4.62 and imminently your contract is cancelled. You've hit the end of the road. 

Based on the virtues of linearity, if you're earning $9.54/day on day 1 and $0/day on day $280. Thus you're earning an average  $4.77/day over 280 days for a total of $1,335.60, **which is a net loss of $839.40 or a return of -38.6% on your initial $2,175.**


**Conclusion**

You will not make money with Genesis. You will lose money, a lot. The only way to make money is through referral links. That makes Genesis an MLM scheme. ";3

Does it count 336 blocks from the first BIP91 block and then sees that it has to have 80% within that 336 block timefram, starting over from 0 when 336 block have been mined?

Or is it 80% of the last 336 blocks and does it just roll over if the 80% is not met counted from the first BIP91 block?

336 blocks take about 56 hours to be found, right? So if BIP91 is not locked in before the 28th of July this could become important, no?

Thanks for any helpful info";3
2051;"Admittedly I have gotten a little fed up with it as well as times.  But just remember that it is *supposed* to be this difficult and it *should* be.  The harder it is, the more distributed and diverse the network is.  We all have different visions of what Bitcoin is and how it is going to change the world.  To come to an agreement about significant changes at the core level, *even* if it's a soft fork, it will inevitably, by its nature, be a difficult and arduous process of **having to convince people of your argument, and prove to them the reliability of the code.** It is proof of a widely distributed power structure within the ecosystem. And it is proof that no one is able to simply force a change onto other players. 

Had SegWit actually been dangerous, unsecure, and risky code, then BIP148 would have been a joke.  1000 nodes wouldn't have done anything except fork to their own coin.  But *specifically because* SegWit was clearly safe code that presented multiple improvements, BIP148 simply became the excuse to finally make a decision.  But make no mistake, BIP148 success is not exactly what this activation demonstrates.  It is a better demonstration of the networks tendency toward extensive debate and testing in the face of controversial code, the process of broad decentralized consensus, and conservatism in the face of uncertainty.

TL;DR This entire process has doubled my confidence in Bitcoin as a secure, long term financial network that is going to completely change the nature of money, trade, and governance across the entire planet.  You thought the internet had an impact in the last 20 years?  You haven't seen *anything* yet.";5

2058;"An interesting aspect with BitcoinCash (Bitmains hardforking altcoin) is that users who want to split their coins and exchange them might be vulnerable to chain analysis companies when not taking a lot of care.   

One typical issue is coin-merge: 
You use Bitcoins tx outputs as inputs for a larger tx sent to an exchange or coin split service and reveal that you are the owner of all those tx outputs.    
If you use a KYCed exchange your full identity is connected to those tx outputs.  
But even if you exchange on Bisq where your privacy is much better protected there are some risks due the privacy flaws of Bloomfiters in BitcoinJ's SPV implementation (see: https://bisq.io/blog/privacy-in-bitsquare).  
Most users are not aware that all BitcoinJ based wallets comes with that privacy flaw. If using company/server based wallets you should not count with much privacy anyway.   
For highly technical users those problems can be controlled but not for 99% of the less skilled Bitcoin users. So the chain analysis companies will love that.

It is really questionable for me if we should add BitcoinCash as Altcoin regarding that background.   

Another reason to consider it that there will be probably no working replay protection in place, so there might be considerable risks involved.  

Beside that Bitcoin Cash is not just another Altcoin but could set a precedent if even slightly successful (what I highly doubt). Do we want that it becomes a fashion to hijack the Bitcoin network and instead of cleanly fork as an Altcoin try to fork off from the existing Bitcoin network? I doubt anyone want to see that.   

I tend that exchanges should rather boycott BitcoinCash as an un-ethical, technically risky and privacy damaging adventure.

2062;"Just my opinion.

It was playing out in my head like a game of 4D chess until I sat back and thought about it and realized there's nothing complicated or unreasonable about the idea. I think the majority of you, and many people currently day/week/month trading BTC are being played. The reason for instability is not uncertainty of the future, it's the fact that thousands of inexperienced traders have access to an easily traded asset with no barriers to entry and they're all reacting to every blip, every tweet, every Reddit post, etc. etc.

The average individual trading or investing in such a volatile asset is being drained of equity and has been for years and nobody seems to realize it yet. Exchanges are taking advantage of you. Mining pools are taking advantage of you. Roger Ver and everybody you bash is taking advantage of you.

And it has been infinitely worse this past month.

All the hype leading to every 'deadline', all the FUD.. Every single fluctuation in Bitcoin over the past month has been the result of actions from a select few individuals and exchanges. Whether Roger Ver &amp; company believe BCC will succeed or not, do you believe they're not playing and riding BTC straight to the bank? BTC-e goes down for maintenance (according to their Twitter) while someone else is shuffling around massive amounts of Bitcoin and suddenly, the masses panic and BTC dips twists and dives for a few hours. Massive numbers of spammy transactions show up in the mempool and people blame it on someone trying to send a message, all the while the collective mining pools are collecting 20-30 times more fees from you than they normally would.

The mistake is believing that everybody using Bitcoin is getting tossed around the same way in the chaos. Someone tried to tell me earlier that nobody is winning with such a chaotic market.. Just remember that experienced traders learned to profit from chaos long before anybody alive today was born. Bitcoin is no exception to the rule.";3

2064;"Bitcoin Cash (BCC), a new digital asset, will be deployed at 12:20 PM (UTC) on Tuesday, August 1st, through a hard fork of the bitcoin network. 

The fork will likely cause disruptions in the bitcoin network. As a result, to protect customer funds, BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals starting at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, July 31st. 

We will give all BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay customers BCC amounts equivalent to the BTC that they have in their accounts at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Tuesday, August 1st, 2017. 

After BCC is distributed to customers:

1. BTCC DAX customers will be able to view their BCC assets under """"Balance."""" https://dax.btcc.com/userbalance 

2. BTCC USD Exchange customers will be able to view their BCC assets under """"Overview"""" in """"Account."""" https://exchange.btcc.com/account/overview

3. JustPay customers will be able to view their BCC assets in """"Asset Overview"""" on BTCChina's Blockchain+ trading platform. https://plus.btcchina.com

4. BTCC DAX and USD Exchange customers will be able to withdraw their BCC assets; BTCC DAX and USD Exchange will not support BCC trading for the time being. We will inform customers when they will be able to withdraw their BCC from BTCC DAX and USD Exchange. 

5. BTCC JustPay customers will be able to trade BCC/CNY on BTCChina's Blockchain+ trading platform. Blockchain+ will not support BCC deposits or withdrawals in the short term; this position will be reconsidered based on the stability and maturity of the BCC network. 

6. BTCC reserves the right to suspend or stop BCC withdrawals based on market conditions.

Please note that BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, July 31st ahead of the hard fork. We will let customers know when deposits and withdrawals resume; we will aim to resume deposits and withdrawals as soon as possible after the hard fork.

Customers may find that BTC transfer confirmations are slow or that transactions are not confirmed around the time that the hard fork occurs. BTCC will strive to process customers' bitcoin transfers as quickly as possible, but whether or not bitcoin transfers are confirmed will depend on the stability of the bitcoin network after the hard fork. As such, BTCC cannot guarantee that bitcoin deposits to customers’ accounts after we suspend deposits at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, July 31st will be promptly credited to the relevant accounts. We also cannot guarantee that customers will receive BCC for BTC deposited to BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay after 4:00 AM (UTC) on July 31st.

Since making Bitcoin gaining more adoption is a more difficult task, they would like to reduce Bitcoin mining cost. How can you do that if you have to compete with every other miner? You pull the 3 cups trick with only 2.

I'm seeking clarification. The market on Coinsquare has been up and down, it was showing BTC worth $23.19/1 BTC in CAD at 5:30PM EST today. It showed the market dipping low several times today, were these indeed flash crashes? I redeemed a $100 Flexepin voucher at 5:31PM and the market still shows BTC at this price. My amount purchased does not reflect what I thought it would do (I thought this meant a small window of opportunity to get 4 BTC, sort of the right time/right place kind of thing). Instead I have 0.02253584 BTC purchased. Even as I type this, CS website is showing BTC at $23.19 CAD per 1 BTC. 

I already filled out a support ticket but maybe I'm wrong about something. That was my first time redeeming a Flexepin voucher but it went through with no problems. I should note that the voucher does not redeem the $100 Flexepin voucher to Canadian dollars on the exchange, it notes that it instantly converts to BTC. Any help from the community would be great.

All this talk about mining centralization got me curious, so I decided to do a little digging myself.

Am I mistaken in thinking that pools shouldn't share addresses? I've never followed mining before, and didn't do any pre-fork analysis. Has this always been the case?

So far, it's a nice chunk of profit over a period of about 3 months. Percentage-wise, it's massive. I didn't invest very much however.

I recently sold all at €2900 and change, thinking it would soon drop considerably.

BTC is valued at €3027 as of right now.

So here's a lesson for those getting into crypto: There is no """"peak value"""" to reach. Yes there are valleys and massive dips at times, but so far, BTC have consistently bounced back and gone even higher. I really have no idea where Bitcoin might peak, if indeed it ever will.

Lesson learned? Do. Not. Sell.

2096;"First of all I wanted to say that I am completely new here and therefore I am not sure where to exactly post my questions but I hope I am at the right spot...
So i decided to jump on the Bitcoin train aswell but unfortunately too late and instead of 2400euro/btc I had to pay 2800euro/btc. At the moment I don't want to use any hardware wallet and therefore I had to create a wallet as secure as possible because otherwise I am always scared about virtual theft and I have too much to lose. I created a bootable USB drive and downloaded the newest tail from the official website, I verified the version through the firefox addon and furthermore through Kleopatra and some SHA-256 Hash (instruction from the internet) but I heard there are still ways to have downloaded a infected version through something called man in the middle attack, is that possible or am I just paranoid? After that I booted from the USB and had my WIFI turned off the whole time and created a standard wallet in Electrum, encrypted the persistent storage and Electrum and wrote down the seed words on paper. I created a watch only adress with the public key from Electrum to watch transactions. I already sent some amount to my public adresses and recieved them successfully but my balance on tails obviously shows 0 because it was never connected to the internet. What I want to know now is that how am I able to restore my wallet from any given computer if my seed words have been created offline and therefore have never been able to be sent to electrum servers? So how do I exactly verify that I own the coins without connecting my offline wallet to the internet?  Furthermore I wanted to ask if my wallet is 99.99% safe from any virtual theft since my intentions are to hold btc for long term purposes? Also in order to satisfy my mind that I will always be the owner of my btc I need to know what will happen if Electrum somehow vanishes and all the servers are shutdown how will I be able to restore my wallet from the seeds because no other program except Electrum would accept those seed words and only if they have been transmitted to the internet before, right ? So basically I need to understand the concept about the way I actually stored my bitcoins and if it is safe enough for 5-10 years from virtual theft or any problems that might occur if electrum servers are shut down?

Price worshipers, why are you here? Mash F5 on the charts for anyone else cares, but I like to think the bulk of us are here for a distilled reading of current events surrounding material news and discussion and not roller coaster memes, or anecdotes on turning the future of finance back into fiat. 

Are you here because of the fundamentals of the technology and the disruption it will make on society and governments? or are you a trader in for a quick fiat buck? No judgement on the latter, but for fucks sake take it over to /r/BitcoinMarkets 

If you believe in the technology and relevant discussion, the current price doesn't matter because not only are we are a VERY LONG way from mass-adoption, but because price is not a measure of adoption either. Bitcoin is a binary story, literally and figuratively, if it succeeds its fiat equivalent is immaterial because fiat will be effectively dead.

Just realize, that every time you make a big deal about Bitcoin's price relative to obsolete and immoral fiat, you undermine the principles it was built upon. Shit happens, we still live in a fiat world, so if you need to convert... try to keep it in the bitcoin economy and not money-services-businesses... and don't brag about your failure as a **hold**er.

2114;"We've all heard that doing a Brain Wallet is a bad idea and I should probably just use Warp Wallet and be done with it, however I was trying to think of a way to hold multiple wallets in my brain without too much work and came up with an idea I'm hoping someone with a deeper knowledge of cryptography can tell me not to do.

My idea would be a brain vault in the sense I could easily remember how to get the keys to say, 10+ accounts. It would also allow me to """"back up"""" my accounts to a safe deposit box in such a way that even if the government could take those paper backups they could never seize the bitcoin from them. In a way, this system would be like an HD brain wallet, so here goes:

My brain vault would be something like:

""""Today, I'm going to store my Bitcoin in:""""
(This I would keep in my mind as the """"Vault Phrase"""")
 
Then I would remember (and back-up to a safe deposit box) the countries in which I've """"Stored"""" my bitcoins. Next I would choose a country, let's say Germany. So Germany is in a list in my bank with a number next to it in the safe-deposit box, but it's also something I can easily remember without the bank, It's such a basic piece of information I can simply put it up on Google Docs as well with the amounts, these have each become separate accounts I can retrieve simply. What I would do next was SHA-256 both my code phrase as well as my code word so I would have my vault-phrase as:

""""Today I'm going to store my Bitcoin in:""""
SHA'd: 5cca96a6abc26effebd53412edd7bf1a39e6a4da421b6497fa458eb77912376b

""""Germany""""
80db4ccdca106d37b920206331fcfe3e9e50a9e763d89b54ce3ad5ac8cf30f03

Finally, I'd assemble the two (which is easy to remember to do since one naturally follows the next) in some scheme such as:

""""5cca96a6abc26effebd53412edd7bf1a39e6a4da421b6497fa458eb77912376b+80db4ccdca106d37b920206331fcfe3e9e50a9e763d89b54ce3ad5ac8cf30f03"""" 

this string would then be SHA-256'd to a final:
e6a325c430dcab9af196edcda30501d5e4aa53dda82dd08c7e5ca7340423bb67 

which (through familiar means over at bitaddress) finally becomes our """"German"""" account. 1D2NXX1mJcLUmwdRAihjdfQ6jP9ZdRHUvh

This system could be implemented using a Question and Answer scheme as well. With the Vault-Phrase: """"Who's got my Bitcoin?"""" and answers being family or friend's names. The overall idea is that one is manually creating a salt and pairing it with simple passwords that serve as a two-factor method of backing up stuff.

First question. Can I do an atomic swap as a single person? Do I NEED to find someone with an altcoin wanting Bitcoin or can I send my Bitcoin into the void and simply receive back my alt coin of choice?

Second Question which is more towards the thread title is this. I'm just wondering if, when other Segwit Atomic swap coins come into play, will that potentially surge prices back and forth until the overall value of those coins find its level like water.

-&gt; I'm talking about; a person who is not a trader, and doesn't understand blockchain technology goes into the AppStore on their mobile device and downloads the mining-pool app. This person then either starts their own pool with friends setting their own reward scheme which grows or joins somebody else's.

Coinbase seems to have an advantage as an exchange because of its simple user interface and it's accessibility to non-tech-savvy &amp; non-market/trading-savvy users. This simplicity could be introduced into mining to bring it to the layman.

2140;"**Leading Chinese exchanges have been accused of using customer funds to make high-risk private investments, Xinhua News Agency has reported.**

Xinhua alleges that Huobi and Okcoin collectively invested approximately 1b yuan ($150 m USD) into “wealth-management products”, citing recent investigations made into the activities of cryptocurrency exchanges by the People’s Bank of China.
 
**Okcoin has issued a statement refuting the allegations, stating “we at OKCoin have a strict policy of placing idle client funds into lower-risk banking products.** This policy is in keeping with general practices in the banking and securities industry, for both the purpose of safeguarding clients funds.” Huobi is yet to issue a statement regarding the allegations.

Xinhua has since published an editorial piece advocating for greater government regulation in the face of increasing dynamism within the cryptocurrency sphere. “New things are developing so fast that regulations must keep pace,” Xinhuan states, before expounding that authorities go to greater lengths to shut down bitcoin exchanges suspected of “dubious” operations.
 
Ascertaining the validity of Xinhua’s claims has become difficult due to the absence of further documentation supporting the allegations. Western media has been unable to access a key People’s Bank of China report cited in the article, and further details regarding the investment products that hosted clients funds are unavailable.
 
Beijing-based bitcoin exchange employees have revealed that cryptocurrency exchanges have become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny following the People’s Bank of China’s crackdown on leading cryptocurrency exchanges, included mandatory reporting to China’s central bank.

Each asset can each have multiple addresses, say 5 for BTC and 5 for ETH.

2144;"Hi everyone!

Today i went to a market room in a very famous bank ( sorry can't disclose the name), and I had a talk with equity and foreign exchange traders about bitcoin.

First they all knew about it, which is a great beginning.  they all did research, like what is mining, where do coins come from, what is the algorithm behind, the pros/cons....

As I was trying to explain them that the bitcoin community was using bitcoin as a hedge, and compared it to """"gold"""" they all laugh! 
They pulled out a volatility index and BTC/usd graph. They also explained me that a currency that is that volatile was not viable for commercial use ( I totally get it, how can a merchant make sur the currency won't take a 10~12% dive while the transaction is being processed). 

Then I tried to explain that is was great to send money across the world with low fees, once again they showed me the graph and how it would affect everyone one ( sender/ receiver if the value dropped). And how ridiculous fees could get ( yes praise segwit).

I also showed them other crypto more stable like litecoin, but as soon as they understood it they told me the value of the it was based on the bitcoin, which is kind of true. And therefore not stable. How a merchant could fix a price if the value keeps fluctuate?

Also they are concern about privacy, why would you like to be anonymous, like what is the point, they showed me a dropped in bitcoin after silkroad was shutdown. ( they didn't mention terrorism!!)

In the end we conclude the discussion by mentioning that some banks were already trying to offer their own crypto to their clients, to which I respond, that we would not be able to control the supply and they could cheat us by supplying more than what they told. They kind of agree..

We then ended up in a discussion that was about : """"if crypto take over  fiat """" : 
lending money ( to buy a house for example) would not be possible anymore,  the banking system will die. 
The reasoning is that we cannot sell bitcoin if we don't have some ( like if you short a stock) so bank won't be able to provide loan, which will be terrible for the economy.

If you have any feedback or questions, or want more details about a point that is mentioned here I would be glad to answer it.

If your questions/explaination is relevant I'll try to ask them next week and get their pov on it

Hope you have a different approach of bitcoin now.

I told my family over dinner I did something revolutionary, and my step-father scoffed and said it's dangerous as it isn't backed by anything, unlike money which is backed by gold. I responded by saying we've been off the gold standard since 1973 (US removed it in 1971, the rest of the world followed).  I sent him [this video](https://youtu.be/GNo7MDN5-0g) from Extra History, this was his response:

""""Thanks. But ... Bitcoin is not a currency. It's an asset. While currencies are no longer backed by the gold standard, they are backed by something tangible: their country's economic output., made up of goods and services. Bitcoin is not only virtual, it's finite, at 21 million units. Given the very fact that its value is based on perception, it is inherently unstable. It must be. A better analogy for Bitcoin is a company's shares, of which there is usually a finite amount. The value of those shares fluctuates, sometimes wildly, according to public perception of their worth. Shares are an asset, not a currency.""""

I was going to respond with this:

""""Currency is defined as a system of money in general use in a particular country. Unlike shares, I can spend my bitcoin at shops in my country and/or online. That it is digital doesn't matter.

It's a tradable asset and like any other tradable asset it has volatility issues, but so do currencies backed by countries with economic output. Look at 1923 Germany, Nigeria last century and now Venezuela. I admit Bitcoin is more volatile but it's no different than any other currency that can be influenced by public perception. It is backed by economic output, it's just not centralised in one country. Instead data miners around the world are creating that value by using computer power rather than manpower. Bitcoin's market capitilsation is currently standing at USD$72 Billion.

The finite amount of Bitcoin is like any other currency too. There is a finite amount of gold and a finite amount of money in the world. However gold prices can be influenced by gold rushes which sends gold prices plummeting. Rampant money printing can cause huge inflation in local economies. On the other hand Bitcoin becomes harder to 'mine' as more miners join the network. Only 1/3 of those 21 million units have been mined and once the mining is over that Bitcoin will still exist while miners can migrate to other cryptocurrencies. I only spent USD$25 yesterday and received 0.005 of a Bitcoin. You don't have to own a whole Bitcoin to own some, just like you don't need to carry $100 notes everywhere.""""

2158;"With it's decentralized ledger and world-wide access, Bitcoin is not only an interesting investment, but it is also undermining every financial &amp; political system on earth that requires us to trust a central entity to keep a record, and to speak that record back to the public for proof or decision making. Here are the things we spoke about at our round table - they give me some hope for the future that didn't exist in a real way before bitcoin.

- The need for real life banks is gone, they can exist for other useful/different reasons, but everyday large scale transactions and most daily personal banking needs, and generally financial security are all no longer bank dependent (nor credit card/website dependent).. Just this alone could really change a lot. If all the resources and money lost to huge salaries, """"legal corruption"""", along with a now very archaic infrastructure (right down to air-conditioned skyscrapers) and untrained staff, were all translated into savings for the common user, the world market would be very different. The amounts of profit that banks make alone is staggering. At least in the billions per bank per year in 1st world countries. Then there is the fraud... Our personal estimates of 10s of trillions of dollars saved over short amounts of times (a few years) seemed almost conservative when taking everything into consideration. 

- War resistant money! Bitcoin means that people can flee their homeland, leave their home and everything they have, get to some other safe place, use an airport internet hotspot and access their entire life savings without interruption. Also, as a whole, the public money is safe, even if taken over completely, when the military takes over, when the religious wars are waged, no money will necessarily be at risk. We wondered, if wars could not be funded by robbing the country being invaded, could they be fully paid for by taking natural resources and land alone? We weren't sure, but it would take out a big bite. There were so many different little reasons we came up with around war, but I'll move on.

- Voting. No need to dwell on this one, obviously voting and fraud is a big conversation these days. A blockchain based voting system is surely going to shed some light on the true opinions of the nation. We were not so sure if this would be a big deal or not, but we decided its best to be sure fraud is dealt with at this level of decision making. But also, since voting could potentially be in your hands, on a phone or device, maybe we vote together on some of the simpler decisions, it could deflate the pressure on higher levels of govt to make these decisions, maybe they could spend some time on important things etc... Why spend so much time discussing things in govt when we could know the exact sentiments of the entire country very quickly and cheaply. This blockchain tech doesn't exist yet so I'll leave it alone. 

- Immutable history. I mean, this is the first time there is the potential for human history to be recorded in a verifiable way. We could actually be able to all agree on what happened and how it happened because there is a decentralized ledger. If one pays close attention to how much merit and importance we put into history and how things went...With modern education there is a constant need to show you how to feel about the world, why we are the good ones &amp; who is bad. The internet feeds this desire to new heights of addiction. A blockchain of events, not only financial but of all events could change our relationships worldwide.

I know some of these things are blockchain based ideas, I personally believe the bitcoin blockchain is capable of doing all of these things in some way, or at least the network could power &amp; secure these types of tech. Being the one largest, most secure, immutable ledgers on earth with no central authority, there is a reason to continue on with Bitcoin as the main blockchain. These few things I mentioned above are just a small example of the earth-changing things that Bitcoin is capable of, we have only scratched the surface.";4

2173;Although I imagine that this is potentially an overall net positive for the bitcoin and crypto space, I am concerned about Wall Street's ability to begin substantially manipulating the prices of BTC and the crypto market at large. When considering that there is only so many BTC in existence, I would think that this influence will be limited and that they will only contribute to Bitcoin's overall rise.  Unfortunately there's  two main problems that I see here. 1) Wall Street is run by banks (BTC competition) and  2) Wall Street has been known to manipulate all kinds of markets.. ie.  naked shorting.  Considering that Bitcoins natural enemies are seemingly closer than ever to directly participating in our market with unlimited fiat resources, I would hope that the community has some kind of plan to be able to keep track of their purchases / sells. I believe that as a community we need to keep tabs (to the extent possible anyway) on how much crypto is held by these organizations so that at any time we know the true extent of their influence on the crypto markets. Is anyone out there familiar with any projects which are running now or being set up to monitor this kind of information?  If not then hopefully this post can spark some interest in the community to consider the benefits of such a program.  At the end of the day I believe that most of the larger holders of BTC aren't budging with their coins and see it as the potential future reserve currency.  However we're still years away from that and in the meantime these financial powerhouses can do a lot of damage to the natural evolution if we're not careful.

2225;"Bitcoin may be in for a sustained record run as it overcomes key obstacles, experts said Thursday after the cryptocurrency set a new record high.

Even bitcoin fans were plagued by doubts over the summer when Chinese regulators cracked down on exchanges trading the virtual currency and a dispute among developers gave birth to a new version, splitting the market of the budding currency.

In September, banking regulators in Beijing and Shanghai ordered local cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down.

But observers say they are now detecting a rethink by the Chinese authorities, causing bitcoin on Thursday to surge past the $5,000 level for the first time since its launch eight years ago.

Around 1530 GMT its value based on a basket of trading exchanges calculated by Bloomberg was $5,247.02, up from $4,829.29 late Wednesday.

This represents a rise of 400 percent this year alone.";5
2226;"Hey all, apologies for the newbie question, but maybe others will find it helpful as well.  

So, there's a probable fork coming up.  How do protect my coins during the turbulence?  If I've read about the past forks correctly and the method is the same then all I have to do is- keep my btc in a wallet (cold or hard) but off of an *exchange*.  Is that correct/true this time?  

Then, if I'm on an exchange, I'll have to do whatever that exchange decides to do.  In a wallet, things will unfurl however they do, but I'll still have btc, and afterwards I can decide to keep or move or whatever.  And at least in the first few days I'd be able to trade to whereever I wanted to go and price would be near parity for btc=$$$=&lt;new-fork-symbol-if-there-is-one&gt;.  Is that correct?

Even on an exchange though, I'd still have that ability, to move... but I might have to actually take that step to get back to btc if that happened.  On a wallet the (only) advantage is I'm confirmed to stay with btc.  Correct?

My goal is simply to avoid this thing I'm reading where a transaction would appear somehow on both blockchains simultaneously.  Which, honestly, I don't quite understand.  If anyone wanted to eli5 me on that, that'd be cool.  But the goal is really, to just protect myself.

2240;I'd like to buy as much bitcoin as I can seeing as the price keeps going up, but I've also seen some predictions that it'll go down again fairly soon. Should I buy bitcoin today or would it be better to wait?;3
2241;"So, a couple years ago I was pretty big into trading bitcoin and other cryptos. I had the metatrader enabled account with the 5:1 leverage and all the best niche technical indicators, price chart widgets on my phone set to update every minute, twitter feeds for all the good pump 'n dumps, all that. Actually paid my rent for a few months that way. And then at some point, life happened, and I had to cash out.

Just recently I finally became financially stable again. I went to reactivate all my old dormant accounts to make a conservative investment and hodl. Sad to see BTC-E gone, I loved those sketchy Russian freaks.

Anyway, I logged into coinbase, and lo and behold, I had a balance estimate of $57.03. It turns out that the $2.37 in change that I left in my account as BTC had appreciated in value, significantly, earning me a nice little bit of pocket change. That little moment really brightened my day.

I wanted to share this with you because I learned a very important life lesson when I was trading full time, and it's stuck with me to this day.

Be happy with the small wins.

It would be really easy for me to open that account up, see that $57.03, and think """"Man, if only I had hodl'd longer, I could be rolling in dough right now! I should have waited! This sucks!"""" 

I did a lot of pump and dumps. For those unfamiliar, a pump and dump is where a bunch of people all buy an obscure altcoin all at once to drive up the price, and then quickly unload it to capitalize on the short term gains. But, since most of the traders involved are the ones operating the pump and dump, in reality it's basically a ponzi scheme at supersonic speeds.

What I learned from those is that the people who make money on those are the people who buy in at the start, wait for the price to rise 5 or 10 percent, and then cash out. The ones who loose money are the ones sitting there, seeing they're 30% up, and being unsatisfied sit there waiting for 31%.

The lesson here is that greed ruins people. It causes people to make stupid trades. It makes people feel like shit when they buy in right before a dip, or obsessively execute dozens of trades trying to get the exact high point of the day.

Before I had $2.37. Now I have $57.03. That's a nice night out with my beautiful girlfriend, or a week's worth of groceries, or a water bill I don't have to worry about.

I could torture myself thinking about how of I had left $6 in there, it'd be $100. Or if I had left $100, it could be $2,500. But you know what? I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna be absolutely thankful that I got about $50 for doing absolutely nothing.


So, remember that guys. Little wins are still wins. Appreciate life, be thankful for what you have, hodl those coins, and don't let it bother you that you didn't buy in or cash out at the perfect moment.";4

As SegWit2x approaches, we want to update you about the future changes and their impact on your operations on CEX.IO.

We always aim to provide our clients with convenient and secure service under the conditions of the highly changing market. And we will do our best to keep all operations on our platform running.

Bitcoin Gold (BTG)

As the Bitcoin Gold fork took place, we would like to inform you that you have received the new coins in an amount equal to the BTC on your balances at the moment of the hard fork.

The full node client is still not released by the development team of Bitcoin Gold, so we are waiting for it to check its security and ensure the safety of transactions. As soon as the BTG client will pass the tests for security, we will add the following pairs:

BTG/BTC
BTG/USD
BTG/EUR
BTG/GBP
The deposits and withdrawals of BTG will be enabled later.

Bitcoin SegWit2X (B2X)

After SegWit2X fork, we will split the coins and add the following pairs:

B2X/BTC
B2X/USD
B2X/EUR
B2X/GBP
Our users will receive new coins, and you will be additionally informed about the proportion. Deposits and withdrawals of B2X will be available later. And it is possible that we will stop withdrawal and deposit operations with BTC until we make sure they are secure.

In any case, do not worry because of the changes Bitcoin is overcoming. Whatever happens, we are going to act in the best interest of our clients, so don't hesitate to use CEX.IO for your benefit.";3

Long story short I bought some and wanted to transfer coin I had to a different wallet for storage and trading on a different platform. Doing this naively without any idea of how bitcoin transactions actually work. I thought you were just moving money. Now I know every action is like a transaction on the Blockchain. 

The platform doing this for me did not mention anything about transaction fees but I now know it is essential to get your transaction confirmed in the Blockchain. It was something like 0.0007btc for a 0.0064 transaction. Now that is a ridiculously high transaction fee (in the opinion of someone who is just New to this). Something like $4 for a $37 transfer. 

I Guess I'm just wondering how or why would bitcoin become mainstream if transaction fees for simple transactions are so high? With all the hype around the technology being so efficient, I don't get how is this feasible for mainstream use with lower denominations?

2274;"Alright, so one thing I don't understand about all these Bitcoin forks is the whole exchanges calling the new coin bitcoins if it has more hash power.

I believe one of the biggest components that helps give Bitcoin backing is that it can actually be used to purchase things, it actually has a value to it. For example, I can buy a game on steam with Bitcoin. Now let's say with one of these forks of Bitcoin, like bitcoin2x or whatever it is called. Lets say that the Chinese mining groups all decide to mine this new coin, effectively giving the new coin (b2x) 51% hash power.

So now all these exchanges start calling what was b2x, Bitcoin. So what happens to my old bit coin? Why in the hell would a new coin ever be called Bitcoin? 

Can I use this new bitcoin to purchase stuff at all the places I could purchase stuff before?

Also, I understand that Bitcoin is supposed to avoid the whole single point of control but how are we avoiding that when apparently the mining community can basically determine what coin is Bitcoin.

2279;"Bubble 100%

Why?

* it's rarely, if ever used to buy legal goods (or accepted for that matter). 
* It is exceedingly volatile, way too volatile to be used as a method of exchange. 
* The extreme volatility also prevents it from being a store of wealth.

Think tulips....

So why don't Amazon take it for goods, they accept every other currency.

Simply put, it is not possible for a business to accept such a volatile pseudo-currency for goods, for obvious reasons.

An example, I buy $5,000 of Tech kit from Amazon paying 1BTC. Amazon might happily take it and IMMEDIATELY convert it to dollars and bank the dollars. Given it's volatility what else could they do (they are not pseudo-currency speculators).

Ok, deal done, you get to spend BTC for goods, they end up with dollars.

Now comes the reason why they could not accept such a volatile pseudo-currency.

You decide that you want a refund 5 days later.... what if BTC has risen by 20% in a few days. Amazon are proper screwed, and would not be able to refund you in dollars and would have to take a huge loss given the margins they trade on to refund you in BTC.

...and before you say it, if they did not convert it immediately to a stable currency, they leave themselves open to a huge loss if BTC tanks.

This is why Bitcoin will not be accepted until it is a stable pseudo-currency.

2283;"_The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'_

(Gordon Lightfoot, The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald)

Bitcoin's strength lately in the face of regulatory, cultural, criminal, and political challenges has been extraordinary. Nothing seems to faze it, not even the Chinese exchange shutdowns. And so we are celebrating another all-time high with Bitcoin seemingly invincible.

There are, however, the storm clouds on the horizon.

The NYA hardfork remains in place with no sign it will be abandoned despite the resounding rejection in multiple futures markets such that it is valued at only 15% of Bitcoin's current price. A few mining pools are not signaling for the NYA, but it remains solidly over 80% of hashrate and supporters are defiant.

The hardfork will have no replay protection in place, an extremely aggressive choice guaranteed to create risks of lost coins in the immediate aftermath of the fork. This will likely lead to headlines in crypto and general media with a very negative impact. 

Gemini, Coinbase and other major exchanges and services are signaling they may call the NYA fork """"Bitcoin"""" simply if the miners stay behind it. NYA strategists are exploring strategies to dominate the legacy Bitcoin fork with empty-block mining. This would prevent any transactions from taking place on the legacy chain (which might reduce replay attacks but still leaves us in rather a bad way). 

So if nothing changes (and the battle lines have remained fairly static now for weeks), we are about two weeks from an existential crisis hitting Bitcoin. How many new investors and old-time hodlers are paying attention? When the headlines announce the fork, followed by news of replay attacks how will they react? When exchanges start listing two different chains as """"Bitcoin"""" and the legacy Bitcoin chain grinds to a halt with zero transactions what will they do? When the NYA chain remains at current low levels while a wave of panic selling hammers the legacy chain, where will it end?

Show me why this won't happen. ";2
2284;My friend and I already invested in bitcoin and he said to use Coinbase, and I gave him $190 USD to invest or me.

I'll be willing to bet against people's stupidity rather than foresight.""""

Him - """"The sudden increase and way that it's value increases exponentially is a the hint one gets before a crash Exactly Thats the point People are stupid""""

""""but, Late Stage Capitalism and failure of entire industries makes new endavours attractive.""""

Him - """"And they'll buy bitcoin meanwhile wealthy investors will suddenly sell up and everyone us fucked Unless some government bans it utterly""""

""""if governments ban it isn't it a good sign that they can't control it therefore it's subversing their power. they certianly aren't looking to protect the populace. they might claim banning it is for that reason but that's just a cover story.""""

Him - """"It's really not that great man""""

See he sees it as another market, a gambling game.

This is why bitcoin is open source. Having a small development team susceptible to a buyout was never a problem because we could always hard fork it if they were compromised. I'm not saying now is the time for that fork, just don't choose a side based on one side being the 'original' when so much money is involved as an influence.";3
2295;"Regardless of what name the new chain is given if new users see 2 bitcoins on the app we are done.  That will be too confusing.  Segwit and blockchain is already hard enough to get but atlesat you can just buy bitcoin at first.

If new users open up coinbase for the first time and see more than one bitcoin we are screwed for a long time.  It will scare new money away.  And if new money goes away price will drop. Holders will sell and price will dive bomb.  People will freak out and sell and there will be millions and millions lost in what is supposed to be a new store of value.  Just because these companies want to support a rushed out pointless blocksize increase that divides the community and ostrizises the devs that made bitcoin what it is today.  The devs that had to fight for segwit for years.  We only just now got segwit through and we havent even seen the cool stuff it can do.  There is absolutely no reason to fork off now.  

On top of that to fork of and give the fork legitimacy on the number 1 on ramp for new customers is absolutely absurd.  There is gonna be major confusion.  And if that confusion causes major value loss than we are gonna see a long bear market again.

Mainly because we are allowing centralized organizations to have a major effect on a decentralized system.  

Coinbase listing this coin will screw us.  Regardless of what name its given.  

Maybe we need decentralized onramps so there isnt such a monopoly on entering this market right now for the average person.

Im not really sure what to do.  I just know for sure if you open up coinbase for the first time and see two different bitcoins because of such a dense history behind segwit your just going to give up.  Theres no way for the average person to make an informed decision and also go to work and hang out with family.  Understanding all this shit takes sooooooo long.  They will just stop buying";3

By current calculations, I own 163 232.027 U.S. dollars at an age of 21. I am yet unsure what am I going to do with this, but certainly not sell. I doubt it has a real value, but I'm seeing different companies are starting to accept BTC as an option to shop. 


Funny thing about this all is that I completely forgot about Bitcoin since 2013 to recent 2017, ever since it passed 7K and I started following it again.

2364;Officially just threw money away, is this how this works?;3
2365;It seems like people are buying bitcoin with the idea that it is more of an investment than a currency. With that notion, people will be reluctant to spend it, as who wants to spend bitcoin on something when it could be worth 100x more down the road. It's the same idea as gold. People HODL gold because of it's potential increase in value, not to use it to regularly buy things. For bitcoin to really transition into what it's meant to be, the masses will need willing to actually spend it, otherwise it will be a failure. Do you see the masses of people moving away from the idea of bitcoin as an investment and more of an actual currency?;4

2367;"I want to smack my friends. Every time I tell them that, """"you need to get involved in Bitcoin!"""" they take it as I'm gloating. I'm not gloating you monkeys, I'm attempting to get you to join the ride. But, there is some history here...

I told all my friends about BTC back in 2013, and I was buying heavily. They called it """"fake money"""" and """"tulips"""". Even when I showed I could cash out and put the cash back into the bank, they called it fake. I begged them then to get involved, and they wouldn't listen.

Now they are super angry, and somehow it's my fault. Well - F em.";3
2368;OK so I'm not really new to crypto  , however I have never sold before (as crazy as that sounds) My question is when you sell on coinbase does the usd hit on your coinbase right away or is there a waiting period? I'm aware to transfer from coinbase to your bank takes 2-4 business days however that isn't what I want to do I just want the money to go into the usd wallet so that I can buy and sell  quicker, any help would be great thanks;3
2369;"Like most of you here, I am working constantly to encourage my friends and love ones to allocate a portion of their non-essential funds to bitcoin/out of inflationary currencies such as the dollar. It’s going well for the most part but I will offer you a cautionary tale.

A retired friend lost 7 bitcoin to a scammer because his google search results returned a fraudulent number when he went searching for the Coinbase customer support number. I believe he searched for “Coinbase 800 number.” Being over 65 he just didn’t have the internet street smarts to recognize that the search results in this case were bogus (Are your loved ones any different?) The exceedingly patient gentlemen on the other end of the phone gently walked him through the process of inadvertently giving away all of his bitcoins which were in Coinbase. He even instructed him on getting his withdrawal limit raised in order to facilitate this.

I now discuss the Coinbase Vault anytime I mention Coinbase to a neophyte. I mention it twice to anyone who might not recognize red flags such as a “customer service agent” offering to remote login to your computer...

The Coinbase number begins with 888 not 1-800...

If anyone gets an answer on the fake number try and get audio of the guy and we can post it here for posterity.";3
2370;"BTC is all over UK media again today. 

My favourite quote was on LBC, what I consider to be a balanced and influential national radio station, from David Buik from Panmure Gordon. 

He said, do not dismiss Bitcoin, it is really starting to gather momentum. 

He also said it’ll be 2-3 years before it overtakes the value of gold. Not sure exactly what that means, but I’ll take it as a positive. ";4
2371;"So, I'll just tell the general story. I mined in the early days (2011) and got myself a whopping 0.5 BTC. Didn't do anything with it because, well, it was fairly worthless. I stopped mining because the price to mine was not worth the pennies you earned.

Fast forward: I lost the wallet on my PC. Forgot about it mostly. But the recent spike made me want to give it one last go of looking for it.

Guess what. Found it on an old HDD with a windows backup on it. Well... found the wallet.dat file anyways. So now I'm installing the Bitcoin Core (former bitcoin qt that the wallet went to) so I can recover the wallet with value.

Ok... so now that that story is out of the way... 

Where the hell do I actually sell and how? ";3
2372;Been doing rather well in the past 30 mins. Saw it jump 200 bucks;4
2373;Been looking at how to buy BTC in CAD and someone said that if you use coinbase you would have to transfer it to a different wallet to cash out. How would this be done and more importantly what are some examples of sites that I could transfer too. (CAD) Thx! :);3
2374;"This is why we should all hope this calms down a bit. 

Holders don't want to sell. How can you blame them? Who wants to pay taxes now and sell at a lower price than in a few years when maybe taxes are gone because government power to collect has been reduced.

However the frog is about to scream and try to jump out of the deep fryer. Better to get to $100K a little slowly and boil the governments in big slow pots where they won't even notice.

2391;What are BTC futures exactly. Thanks in advance.;3
2392;"That's the gist of it. I'm hoping there’s some way to get into it by either finding the wallet seed, password, or the private key (I understand it's possible to recover a wallet with the private key, but I could be wrong). If anyone can point me in the right direction, please PM me. I found out over thanksgiving, and won’t be able to get back to work until the end of finals next week.

1)We guessed the user password to his macbook, which was his name. The macbook seems to have been set up a week before his passing.  The only items downloaded were TorBrowser, gnupgv2, electrum, teamviewer for remote access to his desktop, and a file labelled """"Key1"""" (a gnupgv2 public key). 

2) We were able to unlock his apple keychain and view everything within by inputting the user password, which included passwords as well as a bunch of """"key"""" objects, many with blank information fields. I do not know what these are. We were also able to unlock all of his Chrome passwords. 

3) The only wallet in the electrum directory is default_wallet.dat, which is password protected. None of the passwords I guessed open the wallet. I tried copying and pasting all passwords from Chrome and the apple keychain, but none of the open the wallet. (Does pasting a password invalidate the login attempt?) I might try using a bruteforce script based off of known passwords for other things.

4) We logged into his localbitcoin account, but the balance was zero, and the account has been inactive since last year. We also found a registration email for a coinbase account, but cannot access it because of the sms verification code (his phone number has been deactivated).

5) I learned that Macs have a """"hidden file"""" feature. I ran some command in the command line that revealed all hidden files, such as the gnupg and electrum directories. Inside the gnupg directory are some .gpg files (trustd, pubring, secring, pubring~). I also found a key.asc file in the search field. I understand that gnupg is an encryption client, though I think it may have been used to encrypt communication with dark net vendors. Is there a way that I can search for file on the mac that are encrypted? If so, how do I use what I have to decrypt said files, assuming I can? I have a feeling the password, seed phrase, or private key are somewhere inside an encrypted text file.

6) His iphone was wiped a while ago, but there is a backup in his iCloud. Is there anything there that might be useful?

7) Since we were unsuccessful at this point, we wanted to get into his desktop, since this is what he used the most. The windows login was known until he changed it shortly before passing. None of the Chrome passwords worked, nor any variations of his common passwords. The user account is not linked to a windows account, which is unfortunate because we have that login information. I understand that there are ways to crack the user login for an offline user account.

8) At this point I don't know if the mac was ever actually used to store BTC. I have a hunch that the default_wallet.dat is exactly that, the default wallet created when electrum was installed, and not something he ever actually used. I think the actual wallet is on the desktop.

9) Our most recent effort has been searching through his room to find the seed written down somewhere, or maybe a password. I found a slip of paper with what looks like four passwords written on it. These do not open default_wallet or the desktop. I also found a loose HDD that I haven’t looked at at the contents of, and a thumb drive with an fseventsd folder and some scripts (I think they were .bash or .py, I haven’t looked in a few weeks)

This is the information I have so far. I feel like much of it is tied together, but I am not familiar with electrum or encryption. He was big on privacy and took many steps to protect his own, but since I was able to get nearly every password of his by guessing his name, my gut feeling is that he slipped up somewhere else as well.
Again, If anybody can tell me what the things I found are used for and/or how they can be used to recover the wallet, please let me know. His parents could really use the money right now.

2393;"Article by [Jon Buck](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-less-environmental-impact-than-fiat-currencies) :

*The risks of environmental impact because of Bitcoin mining have been widely touted, but a recent report indicates that the actual damage from Bitcoin mining may well be far less than that associated with fiat currencies and other industries.*

*Data centers, gold mining and cash production all consume substantially more energy than Bitcoin mining.*

*The report indicates that the annual consumption of power from Bitcoin mining is 8.27 terawatt-hours per year, more than Ireland and other small nations. Nevertheless, this number is actually only an eighth of what data centers in the US consume annually, and the global production of fiat currencies stands at 11 terawatt-hours per year.*

*Gold mining burns a staggering 132 terawatt-hours per year. What’s more, these numbers don’t even include the massive amount spent on vaults, banks, security systems and more to keep the physical cash and precious metal safe.*

*FUD*
*The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining has been widely touted, particularly by those who believe it to be a non-legitimate currency, but it appears these accusations are more fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), rather than actual facts.*

*These reports do not take into consideration the actual costs of other types of value production, all of which consume resources. In point of fact, Bitcoin consumes less energy than its non-digital equivalents*

After hodling for a good while, I sold my coins when they hit 5,800 in order to pay down my student loans a bit (they're down to 80k - which is a pretty significant reduction). Obviously I shouldn't have sold at that point, but I really wanted to work through some of the debt I was carrying so I felt like I needed to pull the trigger.

My question is this: I have set aside an extra 350 each month to pay in addition to my actual payment in order to work through the loans - do you guys think I should stick with my current plan to pay down the loans or should I roll that 350 back into coin?

Hi @orange.fr,

For withdraw issues please makes sure to read this link: https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000233331-Where-is-my-withdraw-

An authorized status for a withdrawal means you have authorized your withdrawal and the system is working on sending it. In rare cases you may see an Authorized state for longer than expected. Please be patient, the withdrawal will still process, but may need extra time or manual interaction, which we perform throughout the day.

Hi,

The block explorer is showing that this withdrawal has cleared and has confirmed on the block chain. 

If for some reason you still do not have this withdrawal please make sure your wallet is up to date and on the correct chain.

Block Explorer: https://blockchain.info/tx/95054548929b281685cf6b79e43d4a1bee2aec5056778ac0cdbd039e833e4b27 

*This means that Bittrex has fulfilled our end of the send transaction and delivered the coins to the address you entered. These coins cannot be recalled to our wallet and you will need to troubleshoot the receiving end if you have not received them.

You can always check the status of our wallets @ https://www.bittrex.com/status if the wallet is disabled it means we are working to fix it. If the network is behind on blocks you may need to wait until more blocks are found.

*This withdrawal has cleared. Once the transaction id has been generated and is on the block explorer we no longer own those coins as they have been sent to the provided address. If you are still having an issue on the receiving end you will need to contact the holder of the receiving address as these coins show they have been confirmed on the block explorer. If this address belongs to a private wallet you will have to trouble shoot the issue as we do not own the wallet.

Hi,

You will need to research how to properly sync your Ledger Nano S Wallet to make sure its on the correct block height. Bittrex does not own any Ledger wallets so you will need to research this.

Bittrex has know way to know who the address 1Gb25DmuY1wxSHYjHjogSLyFujKCUHYTYb belongs to as addresses do not have any information associated with them unfortunately. When sending coins to an address you always need to make sure you know exactly who the address belongs to before sending your coins to an address.

2404;"As we all know the bitcoin game is a long term strategy, now if we look at the exchanges that promoted s2x, what are their incentives? The sub mainly talks about miner incentives but exchanges are very similar in a way.

Segwit abstracts the need to operate in a centralized exchange, it allows us to build decentralized ones, leaving the centralized ones in the dust. 
When you think about it, its better for them to keep bitcoin static, and scale their servers to cope with the demand, the high fees keep the bitcoin on their servers giving them liquidity.

2406;"**""""I would bet against Bitcoin, if my goal was to lose money.""""

The only correct sentence to explain that view, not motivated by bias.**

You see, Adam Ozimek would be wrong, if his statement was published any time in 99.99% of Bitcoin's life.

2009-2016 Bitcoin has never been valued in these magnitudes. I believe everyone could say, that while there were theorized reasons it would collapse or fail. Those reasons never came to fruition.

So, theory, failure.

Applied practical events that actually happened, success.


There is a different reason to bet against Bitcoin. Say, if you want the market value to decrease, so you can take a more powerful buy condition, in your favor.

Most people who publicly bet against Bitcoin, would not have the ability to affect market valuation...

But if you were a journalist for one of the world's largest financial news publications... Your public defacement could lower the valuation by a measurable percentage.

In any established investment vehicle, this would be a, hammer and nail, conflict of interest, SEC violation.

Since Bitcoin can be obtained anonymously, one could execute these actions, with no fear of reprisal or SEC fine.

However, anyone willing to roll those dice, would likely have OTHER investments that could be traced, and are also in violation of financial conflicts of interest. No blacksmith strikes the iron only once.

Perhaps these possibilities would create a justification and probable cause for scrutiny and a comprehensive audit.

Given that **Bitcoin IS ENTERING regulated trade space via CME, TD Ameritrade, and being offered for futures option positions, it would absolutely fall under conflict of interest and audit jurisdiction.**

If I personally, were to attempt the illegal action I outlined, I would definitely want to do it, BEFORE that futures trading option goes live.

However, I would have to be a bumbling idiot, to try that, less than 72 hours beforehand.

I would be an even larger idiot, if I worked for a large financial company such as Forbes, and used them as a platform to create this action.

This would be completely idiotic, because not only would I expose myself to audit scrutiny and potential fines, I would be placing my employing company in a position of liability, opening them up to the same scrutiny.

Now, if I were a smart company, and an employee tried this, I would fire them immediately, before the hammer of investigation comes down.

Just so it was clear, that my company was not involved, and alleviate this liability.

I am not claiming any of this happened, as I have outlined.

I am not claiming any person or company is personally at fault.

I am just discussing that these are hypothetical possibilities, that could be considered.

So, any SEC investigators drooling at the mouth yet?";4

2412;"I just thought of this idea, please let me know what you think...

Because bitcoin is on a public ledger, we can see the addresses with the most\least bitcoins. 

Unfortunately, we're seeing the same '1%' effect, where small portion of people hold the majority of BTC.

So I was thinking of creating a lottery website where people donate any amount of BTC they desire which goes into a escrow fund. 

Periodically, the system will select a group of bitcoin addresses at a certain value level (ex: addresses below 1BTC). Then it would send funds to these pseudo randomly selected addresses.
";3
2413;I’ve been seeing a lot of info on integration test progress for LN however I’m still pretty new to the crypto space. Is there any rough estimate on when it will be ready for use?;3
2414;I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. What are your thoughts?;3
2415;"please help Confirm the sending.

https://blockchain.info/tx/9fc0b2c53fc1fd82c1bb29bf2d675a94866834a1b9b9159a28aec1ff7dd80c0a";3
2416;"Been thinking about crypto for the past few days especially with BTC forks like BCH and BTG. I know many here are ready to shit on those forks, and I agree with you guys, but selling it off or trading it isn't as easy as it seems. I've been thinking of moving those funds, and was ready to convert it all to BTC until I thought more about the taxes more.

Hypothetically, if have 100 BTC and now have 100 BCH and BTG, converting that 100 BCH =&gt; BTC for instance today would trigger a massive tax bill. That's a $200k sale, and one would have to cough up maybe $50k or more (depending on your tax bracket, and state) to cover that.

Now of course some here will say taxation is theft. Fine. You probably could Shapeshift those funds without issues. What happens when you decide to start cashing out BTC next year of 5 years later? The IRS could see that you failed to pay taxes in 2017 during the fork, and you could jeopardize future accessibility to your funds.

So now faced with that choice, it seems that if I ever want to move any BCH/BTC around, I should plan for paying up taxes immediately, which is an accounting nightmare.

The second issue seems to be the fact that moving these funds reduces privacy. 100 BCH or 100 BTG might not seem like massive life changing amounts, but if you're not careful, moving those funds easily reveals your 100 BTC. I'm not even sure how to best approach this, but it seems like after each fork, one should sweep all their funds (of either or even both sets of coins) into new separate addresses. It still doesn't take rocket science to figure out that the two sets of funds are linked. Maybe a tumbler?

Anyone look into these issues yet?";3
2417;"After reading and watching a load of talks and books in the past few weeks, I cannot tell you how excited I am. I know I'm late to the party, but this... this is going to change the world. I feel energized and optimistic in a way I haven't felt in a very long time. 

So, I am ready to make the jump and buy some BTC, but I believe in the philosophy of a free currency, and I'm convinced for that to be true, regular old Joe's transactions need to be anonymous.

I tried online, but that was a no-no. Every place I checked requires identification and subsequent verification (Coinbase, Bitpanda, Bitmama, Krakhen, Belgacoin, Bitcoin.de). Cannot use bisq, because I still don't own any. 

So, while I am full on into blockchain currency and would prefer to buy close to 1BTC, I resign myself to much less as a proof of concept, and I say let's go with the only easy alternative I know: cash. 
After checking localbitcoins, I got in touch with three personal traders. All three replied pretty quickly, in less than 24h, but said they had ran out and needed to take the posting down. So I resigned myself to exchange businesses and ATMs. I selected 1 shop and 2 ATMs and traveled to the biggest city around, Barcelona (Spain). I spent over 5 hours going from place to place and visited the first three spots. Then I expanded the trip to all 6 spots I could find listed in Barcelona, because damn if I wasn't going to get some. My report card (so much failure):

- two machines had been decommissioned long ago
- two places were closed (note that this was 9am-1pm, within working hours)
- another one was closed but answered to the phone saying they were out, 
- finally, the last shop was open, but the machine was out of order (they said they had sold whatever remnants they had first thing in the morning).

And here I am, with three empty wallets and a flaccid phone. Is that...

- normal where you are from or an issue local to Barcelona?
- common all the time or limited to this time/craze?
- do you know of a reputable cash seller in Barcelona or any anon alternative?
- are there any thoughts/concerns/attempts at addressing that situation in the community that I have missed?

Instead of dishing out the same advice that is stagnant and not adaptable, I propose the following to curb fishing / fake website attacks:

1. The community create a scam page with a list of domains that are known fishing sites.

2. The community recommend domain blockers for various operating systems.

3. All a web-wallet user has to is install a domain blocker, add the most up to date list of fishing sites, and they have secured themselves almost to the fullest extent within their power when using web-wallets.

Now all of these are just platforms, where are the actual HUGE use-cases that will eventually BE the users of the technology and not just another platform with it’s own token and lot of speculative money that takes away the attention from the technology and focuses it on money making, therefore attracts too much money, too much malbehavior because you can steal money, therefore attracts it’s own death by abusers that always come with big money.
5. Internet = InformationTechnology. Now the first application on top of the internet that really made a lot of sense was email. Later the browser. All of them are information technology.
6. Blockchain = Decentralized Systems with Zero Transaction Fees. First (and only) application that really makes sense for mass scale is a decentralised currency because it benefits most from no-transaction fees and having a decentralised system.
7. If whole blockhain market converges among best a) technology to scale b) platform with biggest network effects/applications that attract even more people at some point, all blockchain products will be level out at 0 transaction fees. If that’s the point, we basically have ONE currency: An international 0 fee exchange money that will change worldwide money flow and therefore worldwide economy.
8. Thus bet on ALL cryptos in a well diversified portfolio.

2499;"I met up with my team last weekend for a belated holiday party. We work as consultants in the information security industry and all live near major cities on the West coast with large technology company footprints. After considering a few gag gifts for our white elephant gift exchange, I decided on something with more utility: $25USD (our price limit for gifts) worth of bitcoin.

Fortunately I didn't buy the bitcoin 2 months ago when we were originally supposed to have the party, as I have been in the cryptocurrency space for a few years and have witnessed the price volatility firsthand. I've also gifted small amounts of bitcoin before and was met with a lot of confusion about how exactly it all works, not to mention the difficulty of securing the wallet's private key.

With this in mind, I decided to print an IOU and have a discussion with whoever got it about options for securely accepting/storing, as well as to give the person the opportunity to receive altcoins in lieu of bitcoin (hold your pitchforks, I did this for a reason).

**Observations/outcomes from the gift exchange:**

Out of a group of almost a dozen people, none owned bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies (besides me). These are people with technical backgrounds and decades of experience in the information security sector. They have worked for tech companies that are regarded as industry leaders; many are household names. All of them had heard of bitcoin (not surprising) and most were interested in it to some degree. A few said they had considered buying or had even tried to buy some in the past but had not had the time to actually complete a transaction or finish the account setup process.

Only one person made a comment about how bitcoin had """"crashed"""", but it was mostly in good fun as we all like to give each other hell from time to time. I was prepared for this topic though, and the inside of the card contained a graph of the price chart over the past year. It segued into a great conversation about why the best long-term strategy is to hodl and how media reports manipulate the truth in order to maximize drama (aka clickbait, a concept with which we were all familiar). The same person who made the crash comment later told me that he was mostly just frustrated that he hadn't bought any bitcoin when it was cheaper.

My IOU card was by far the smallest present in size. It was picked by the second oldest person in our group (mid-40s) with 3-4 gifts still remaining (out of maybe 7 or 8 total), and was promptly stolen within 1-2 turns by the youngest person in our group (30). My numbers aren't exact because alcohol was involved. ;) For context: white elephant gift exchanges involve each person drawing a number and then taking turns choosing either an unopened present or to steal a present that has already been opened. 

The person who initially chose the card still ended up getting some BTC even though the gift was stolen by someone else in the group. He did this by paying for my breakfast in exchange for me sending him the equivalent amount in BTC.

Both people chose to receive bitcoin instead of any altcoins, though we did have a great discussion about some other projects I personally find interesting (ethereum, steem, and storj). I offered the option to receive altcoins mainly because I was interested to see what the recipient would choose.

Both chose to receive their bitcoin via newly created coinbase accounts. I know many here aren't the biggest fans of Coinbase, but they had both already heard of the company and opted to use it for now due to the low barrier of entry. I did discuss hardware wallets and some desktop/mobile wallet solutions, and strongly recommended they explore those options if they start to accumulate any serious quantities of cryptocurrency. 

Both were interested in mining and seemed a bit disappointed when I let them know that it's pointless to try to CPU/GPU mine BTC at this point. I told them about ASIC mining but neither seemed to show any interest in purchasing special equipment. They are both now mining monero though with PCs that were collecting dust in the closet, even though I made sure to let them know that they will not make much in the way of profit unless the value of monero goes up.

All in all it was a very interesting weekend... I got to nerd out and talk about cryptocurrency with some coworkers, and also get a feel for real-world bitcoin adoption among technical people (short version: there's a TON of room to grow). It's anecdotal, obviously... but I thought I'd post it here in case anyone else was interested.

2506;"The stock market took a dive today when the rates shot to almost 3%. If you notice around the world interest rates are rising everywhere.

2507;"Innovations in the field of decentralisation, focusing on such issues as exclusion of man-in-the-middle in trustless environments, protecting user, data and financial privacy, asset inalienability and censorship-resistance need to be funded by the community in a transparent and unregulated way with proper long-term capitalistic rewards both to project founders, key persons and investors. ROI for such persons must be proportional only to the amount of risk appetite of betters and overall project success and adoption.

Existing models of funding being popular in crypto community, such as pre-mine or ICO, do not suit these goals, usually being easily censorable by regulators, vulnerable to thefts (due to centralised cost storage on accounts). Also they lead to uncontrollable inflation in overall volume of cryptocurrency, diminishing value of existing currencies in unpredictable way and creating risks for new economical crises of deleveraging as can happen with many loosely-connected assets without clear and predictable market supply.

Other alternatives, being explored by bitcoin community, like self-funding, charity, value-added services (consulting etc), early mining etc have many other drawbacks such as reward not proportional to the project success or the risk undertaken, difficulties with attracting pre-launch funding, free-rides and generic """"left""""-type of approach (""""for the benefit of community"""").

Here I propose a new scheme for funding which does not inflate the overall volume of digital gold however creates ROI for the founders and developers with a decentralised treasury and dividends, making possible also early-stage funding of such projects with venture capital.

The generic idea is the following:

* a new type of blockchain is created, which primary token (tokenA) is linked to bitcoin blockchain either as a sidechain (once/if it will be adopted in Bitcoin mainnet) or with a proof of burn, atomic swaps and demurrage (for achieving 1-to-1 linking with bitcoin with two-way liquidity) but without pre-mine or mining;

* the blockchain takes pre-defined commission from each transaction; this commission is allocated not on an account but as a blockchain-based basic supply for some blockchain-based secondary token (tokenB);

* tokenB represents dividends token: all token owners receive part of the commission proportional to their share in total tokenB supply (i.e. dividends are paid by network/consensus/protocol);

* tokenB tokens can be pre-mined, sold to investors, given as an options and issued in any other possible way that suits needs and plans of founders and project investors.";3

Hi r/bitcoin!

[Our explanation](https://imgur.com/6sAPBpM)

I'm excited to finally announce, tipPLS, a way to allow people to accept tips in real life. I expect musicians, bartenders, and any others who want a convenient way to accept money offline. I wanted to keep my solution cheap $.50 each and bulk pricing available. 
 ";3
2528;I’ve been trying to find a good spreadsheet template to help me keep track of everything for tax purposes. There are tons of really elaborate models online that look impressive and take forever to set up but are essentially useless. I haven’t found a single template that includes capital expenses (i.e. transaction fees and exchange fees). If you’re in the U.S., Australia or the U.K. and you’re not keeping a record of your capital expenses then you’re basically throwing money away. It’ll be way too much effort to work it out properly at tax time. Does anyone have a simple/useful template that I could use? ;3
2529;"Supposedly the ides is to get away from central banks and their """"mindless printing"""" that drives down the value of our money.   Yet here we are.    Exchanges might not be able to create bitcoin etc., but it is clear that what happens there influences the value of bitcoin etc., whence the loud lamenting over Bitfinex, Binance, etc.  whose owners are nevertheless getting very, very rich.


So, what's the diff?   Have we been conned into a bogus revolution?   How are we to change the world at this rate?";3
2530;"I'm moving my bitcoin wallet to a new phone, using Airbitz on both.  I'm a small-time miner, just using my GPU with NiceHash while idle, so I've only got ~0.035 or so.

I've connected the wallet on my new phone and it only shows a balance of ~0.025.  I assumed this was some sort of error so I tried to send my whole ~0.035 to a new wallet, and it says it can only send ~0.025 because all the rest is """"dust"""", which apparently means tiny balances spread across tons of wallet addresses, all too small to be used.

I haven't used Bitcoin a lot (I've done maybe 5 transactions total) so I don't understand how fully 1/3 of my balance could be non-spendable like this.  Anyone know what I should do next?  Is this 0.01 BTC just gone or can I recover it somehow?

2535;"Regarding [the recent announcement](https://coinjournal.net/winklevoss-twins-propose-self-regulatory-organisation-to-monitor-crypto-market/), I believe that the community should have a much needed discussion about what we would like to see in this self-regulatory organization.

No matter how well intentioned the Winklevii are, if they do not create rules to self-govern their own body, eventually it will be corrupted from the inside out with traditional revolving door corruption practices.

We need to stand up now and say that in order for us to accept and promote such organizations to be a leader in the regulated crypto space, we want to see clauses in the Company's Ethos that designate anti-corruption practices.

-No collusion. (Organizers crafting regulation in secret with businesses to optimize pro-business/anti-consumer positions)

-No revolving doors. (Clause must disallow regulatory government agents from taking jobs within this organiztion, and vice versa, for at *least* 3 years).

-No secret meetings (publicized minutes)

2538;"Why is called it r/btc when it only promotes bitcoin cash? Why is it not called r/bch or r/bitcoincash? 

I thought the whole point was r/bitcoin is accused of being censored rather moderated and therefore Roger Ver setup r/btc as a place where all bitcoin topics could be discussed without censorship.

Ok fair enough if you believe the above. Go ahead and setup a new sub reddit, but Roger is very much the closest thing that bitcoin cash has to a mouth piece. Is he an appropriate moderator for a unbiased/balanced/uncensored subreddit? 

From observation the majority of content on that subreddit is either pro bitcoin cash or making negative statements about this sub reddit. It does not appear to be a place balance at all.

So why call it btc why not bch or bitcoincash? Hopefully new users will realise how manipulative the r/btc narrative is in trying to garner their attention and favor.

I’m not commenting on the technology here; I think both chains are realistic attempts at scaling and we probably needed to try them both.

Actually several countries (France, USA, Germany,...) will actually push for implementing tougher crypto regulation.

2546;"If the statement above doesn't apply to your situation (which it doesn't, for 90% of the blockchain projects) than you're good enough with a regular database.

Explanation: We always hear that blockchain has many advantages. Decentralized. Distributed. Immutable.

All these advantages can be reduced to a single core advantage. Blockchain data can't be modified/changed/deleted by any person/cooperation/government in the world. You can put [child pornography](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/20/child-abuse-imagery-bitcoin-blockchain-illegal-content) inside your blockchain and all the governments in the world combined won't have the ability to remove that content.

Blockchain can't be changed, can't be modified, can't be deleted. It's forever.

That's the core advantage of blockchain technology.

The only reason why you would need something that is unchangeable forever is if some other entity (person/government) has the Motive and (not less important) the Ability to change that data.

If you checkout all the existing uses of blockchain, you can see in all of them that there is obviously a will and ability of some entities to change the data. Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, Voting, Identification. All of the current major uses of blockchain technology clearly have an entity with a Motive and Ability which is prevented thanks to blockchain technology.

So before you go and start a new blockchain project, please ask yourself if someone has the Motive and Ability to change your data. If not, don't use the slow, inefficient, complicated database called blockchain.";3

2564;"One of the downsides to centralized ledgers is that you must trust those who have access to them not to change them. Blockchain tech is obviously much different. I'm under the impression that for someone to change Bitcoin's transaction history they'd have to go through all of these steps:

1. Control 51% or more of the mining power.
2. Change a past transaction.
3. Change all transactions affected by that transaction, up to the present moment. This must be done faster than the rate at which new blocks are added.
4. Somehow apply the change to every node on the network?

Remember this little fun fact.

At this price level, if you short the market the maximum gains are capped at 100%, while if you go long the maximum gains are infinite because no one knows how high the crypto market can go. 

Even if the price of BTC went back to $20k thats 250% to 300% return from this point, and everyone knows if we get back to $20k we will go a lot higher.

So after bitcoin has already experienced a 65% decline in price this year it makes absolutely no sense to try and short an extremely limited market when you can go long a potentially unlimited market.

These big names in finance are not looking to short, they are waiting and getting ready to buy in at the bottom then ride this next wave up.

Remember Soros' short trade on the British Pound? He pocketed $1 billion in profit from the Pound crashing. these guys are not here to kill bitcoin and save fiat, they are here to make as much money as possible, and at this point in time they will accomplish that by buying low then driving the bitcoin market to insane heights.

2574;"Among such countries as USA, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia and Malta I would also mention Finland. 

""""Suomen Pankki"""" (SP) (Finland's Central Bank) may be considered a hero role model for other EU financial watchdogs to follow. Not only its officials have been closely monitoring crypto-currencies market for years, gradually deepening their understanding of decentralized digital money environment, but also bank's official statements are remarkably different in its measured and thoughtful tonality from wild, almost maniacal crypto-hunt reports issued by some EU financial institutions.

For example, in January 2014, in the wake of anti-crypto-mania SP published on its web-page the following testimony, which was surreptitiously named """"Bitcoin involves risks"""". Sure, as any other government backed, coercive, centralized financial gatekeeper, which job is to preserve the stability of the current fractional reserve monetary system, SP is far from being """"pro-Bitcoin"""" in it.

Still, when SP's communique says, for instance - """"Use of Bitcoin does, however, involve risks for the user, and its value vis-a-vis official currencies has fluctuated significantly."""" and """"The value of a virtual currency is based on supply and demand only. Authorities or other public bodies are not responsible for the purchasing power or stability of Bitcoin, and it can lose its value."""" that sound like reasonable, although, negative statements, which, however, do not try to invoke readers' fear or to speculate on public ignorance.

There's no surprise, then, that Finland today possesses one of the most crypto-friendly legal environment on the planet. Even though Finnish tax authorities fully tax all profits derived from crypto-transactions, virtual currencies are exempt from VAT. Additionally, you are not require to obtain a special banking license or to follow KYC rules in order to run a local crypto-broker. As usual, government's friendly approach to crypto-businesses is gratified by the surge of entrepreneurial activity in the country. For example, Finland, among other big technological companies, already harbors World's biggest P2P Bitcoin exchange.

I can always consume content at about 100x the rate in audio form than in written form.  I started the podcast assuming I am probably not the only who would've benefitted greatly from something like that being available.  With that, I have ventured back to r/bitcoin recently and seen questions and concerns about Lightning network that show how unfamiliar many still are with it. 

The last 4 episodes of my podcast have all been dedicated to painting a picture of the system that makes the Lightning Network both secure and a significant innovation to crypto.  The first 3 break it down at a technical level by reading, summarizing, and commentating on Aaron van Wirdum's (from BitcoinMagazine) excellent explanatory series that was one of my first introductions to it a few years back.  Then the 4th episode is a final summary (repetition is the only way to really get the whole picture) and then I answer a lot of the common complaints and FUD around it that can be easily addressed from a clear technical perspective.

I have done this specifically for new people who want to learn, so I hope somebody can get something out of it.  I have a few friends that have listened to it multiple times trying to get a better understanding (which might be needed).  With that, I'll provide the links and feel free to share it with anyone you think will be interested or who believes something about Lightning that just isn't remotely true.

Despite my being knee-deep in grief at the moment, I'm also likely going to be in charge of probating his estate; my dude lived  across the country in Colorado and had a home, a couple vehicles etc. that needs to be dealt with. He also owned a small amount of Bitcoin as well as two alts, all of which he was managing via the Breadwallet iPhone app.

Ideally, I would like to either transfer his BTC/alts to my wallet or (perhaps better for probating the estate) just gain access to his wallet and keep his balance as is. Even though he only had a small amount of cryptos, we were both really into it in recent months and I know for a fact that he would want to HODL rather than cash things out (I wish he was around to see the recent uptick). 

I have his phone, but his 14-word key is very likely hidden in some box at his house out in Colorado. We talked briefly about it when I went out to visit him in February but just changed the subject because again, this was not supposed to happen. I'm assuming my first step is going out there and digging for that, but I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on what the best course of action here would be. ";3

Every Bitcoin supporters I hope you guys take the opportunity and fight back to put them down and cover the losses of our poor panic sellers.

2587;"Hi everyone, I am going to write my Master Thesis about inefficiencies in Cryptocurrencies this summer and wanted to know whether you have suggestions what potential inefficiencies I could analyze. I have a finance background and know a company with a huge database on cryptocurrency prices.
An example I could think of would be for example arbitrage opportunities due to different prices of the same cryptocurrency at different exchanges. I want to show that a certain inefficiency exists, and then in the discussion provide explanations for why those inefficiencies might exist.
My thesis should consist of analyses on several such inefficiencies. Help would very much appreciated!";3

2596;"A U.S. federal judge rejected Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd.’s move to block Dubai cryptocurrency firm Alibabacoin Foundation from using the Alibaba name for its Alibabacoin virtual currency.

In his ruling, Judge Paul Oetken of the Southern District of New York (i.e., Manhattan) denied Alibaba’s motion on jurisdictional grounds, saying it failed to show that the use of the Alibabacoin name would hurt its business prospects in New York or would infringe its trademarks in New York.

Surprisingly, the judge said it didn’t matter that Alibabacoin might eventually be listed on a New York exchange.

Judge: No Infringement In New York
Judge Oetken said any damage to Alibaba’s business or reputation from the allegedly infringing use of the Alibaba name occurs in China, not in New York. A U.S. federal judge has no jurisdiction on legal issues that occur in a foreign country.

Alibabacoin contends that China’s ban on initial coin offerings eliminates any possibility that consumers in China will be confused into thinking the Alibabacoin is associated with Alibaba Group.

In a statement on May 1, 2018, Alibabacoin said the judge made the right decision, tweeting: “We firmly believe that Alibabacoin Foundation never acted illegally. Fair and square speaking, we strongly believe and trust the judge’s decision above all else.”

Alibaba Group had sued Alibabacoin Foundation in April 2018, claiming the foundation was unlawfully piggybacking off its name to promote its cryptocurrency.

Alibabacoin: Alibaba Can’t Monopolize Name
Alibabacoin Foundation (also known as ABBC) responded by filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Alibaba Group cannot monopolize the “magical” Alibaba name, Reuters reported.

“The legend of Alibaba conjures up thoughts of magic, gold coins, and ‘Open Sesame,’” the Alibabacoin Foundation argued. “The ABBC entities are well within their rights to use a word connoting magic and golden coins in an area (Alibaba) has not used or, at the very least, has abandoned.”

Interestingly, Alibaba Group’s CEO Jack Ma is a bitcoin skeptic who has expressed concerns over its opaqueness and potential for use in money-laundering, as CCN has reported.

“Bitcoin is not for me,” Ma said. “We are not focused on bitcoin. We are focused on a cashless society for China…trying to make sure the society is more efficient, more transparent, with no corruption.”



Despite his bearishness about bitcoin, Jack Ma is bullish on blockchain. Lynx International, a subsidiary of Alibaba, has successfully integrated blockchain into its cross-border logistics operations.

And it’s likely that Alibaba Group will continue to incorporate blockchain technology into its vast business empire, whose 2017 revenue topped $22 billion.";3
