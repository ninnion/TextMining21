I've seen tons of threads and videos discussing Gemini and Coinbase as well as Coinbase Pro and how fees are rapidly changing left and right. I originally planned on starting out with Gemini, but it looks like people have been getting very mad due to a ton of new fees - people also advocate Coinbase Pro, but I also see threads about how the fees feel like absolute scams for investors.

What brokerage do you recommend for this moment in time and what fees do you pay/associate it with? I'm only 18 and plan on investing generally consistently, likely starting out with $300- $400 among BTC and other alts.

Thanks for any advice, I mainly want to minimize constant fees so I can have my money grow without losing it all through fees, security is also a top priority, obviously!"
1,"Unlike 2017, I actually think we might have a cycle top in altcoins well BEFORE bitcoin's cycle top. Altcoins are getting really dethatched from gravity and could seriously underperform bitcoin over the next year while institutions keep pushing bitcoin to new highs. Historically the pin to pop the altcoin bubble has been a bitcoin crash, but I think it might just pop naturally this time."
2,"It's saying that they noticed I have been sending to prohibited wallets, but nothing further. I haven't made any transactions in MONTHS, except for I sold what was just sitting on the exchange a few days ago (just through the site quick sell).

I really want to know a BITCOINERS' perspective why in your mind Ether and Ethereum as a platform is something you wouldn't invest in?

I hate the fact Vitalik and his developers premined the coins, along with their infinite supply so that is why I don't believe in it and refuse to invest.

Aside from that, why in your opinion investing in it is pointless, given the fact it keeps on rising along with BTC?

If I post this in their thread, all I will hear is that premine is necessary and that Ethereum is a platform of the future.

The main problem::

Since energy usage will keep growing and growing, at some point a significant chunk of world production will have to be used to keep the show going... I‚Äôm not sure if most folks think about this, personally I can‚Äôt see myself ever accepting, say, a full quarter (25%) of Earth‚Äôs energy production going to Bitcoin... Like I would want things to stop before it gets to that point. And quite a few folks I believe have a similar, or even more conservative, mindset. (And probably all governments will be solidly against that too...)

Then we‚Äôre kinda stuck right, since when miners let up to reduce consumption, then some scoundrels would, in all likelihood, wreck the whole thing using 51% attacks...

Is there a way to resolve this issue?"
57,"As the Title indicates , I'm paranoid. I already have some coin on a couple of centralized exchanges, and am weary now of continuing to buy coin on a centralized exchange due to numerous risks such as getting your account potentially frozen, the govt knowing how much you have (and can twist your arm into handing it over), a personal information leak, and numerous other risks noted here [https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/](https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/)

If I know one thing, its to never underestimate the power of the government; they already take a quarter of what we make, and it appears that share will only grow. In addition, there are already talks of our country wanting to have a tax on unrealized gains (among other countries), and the last thing I want to worry about is if my bitcoin holdings will be taxed (it shouldn't because its a currency , but all it takes is a small tweak or vague wording in the Tax Code to change that, not to mention many other factors could change the outcome on Bitcoin tax holdings as well). 

Perhaps the greatest benefit of buying from a centralized exchange is that it is a bit cheaper and more convenient to buy coin from there, but I feel the 1-4% premium I would pay for coin on a decentralized exchange is worth the benefit of security and anonymity. If i had to guess, i would think that Satoshi would want Bitcoin to be used freely amongst its users, as opposed to going through a centralized exchange. After all, Bitcoin was created as """"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"""" not a Peer-to-Centralized Exchange-to-Peer Cash System.

So what do you guys think? Am I being paranoid? Or should I just continue to stack sats on a centralized exchange and hope a tyrannical govt doesn't ruin anything? 

tl;dr Centralized Exchange bad, Decentralized Good? Or am I paranoid?"
58,"Elon is notorious for silly/juvenile pop-culture antics. For example, his car models (S3XY).

He probably has enough dollars, power, and influence to ensure the price of bitcoin trades at $69K on 420.

There is actually a very small (in billionaire terms) amount of liquidity on the open bitcoin market on exchanges right now. Large whales like Michael Saylor and Musk have worked very hard in the past to acquire their bitcoin holdings *without* moving the exchange rate of ‚Çø too much.

But, if they wanted to, they could simply buy up all of the liquid bitcoin on the top exchanges (or possibly just 1 major exchange) until the price was trading at $69K.

Long story short, I sold my 150k dogecoin (I made like +400%) and i was happy but it all started to go downhill from there. Elon Musk tweeted about it like crazy &gt; dogecoin started to go crazy.

My problem is that I can't get over the fact that I had 150k dogecoin before literally 90% of the people now involved in it. Now I have nothing left and I see the coin still going up and I can't help to think how much money I would have made if I didn't sell it stupidly a few months ago.

I feel like shit, it's like I took heavy mental damage and i'm still feeling sick in my stomach because of it. I feel physically sick cause of this ...

Every time I check my BTC and see the dogecoin still going up 10 times more for no reason, it's fucking me up, you can't even imagine ...

I know I could buy some again but it feels too late and I would get like 5% of what I had for the same price. It's a hard call ... I don't know ...

Anyway, I felt like I needed to write this down in order to """"release"""" a little bit all the negative thoughts that i'm having right now.

Thanks for reading."
67,"For those using bitcoin to transact for goods and services; how are you keeping compliant with IRS rules on tracking and reporting gain and loss?

Maybe I'm not understanding it properly, but the best I can glean, ever bitcoin transaction will carry implied gain or loss because the value fluctuation. The IRS has deemed it property, so in theory we're supposed to track all these gains and losses and report. The recipient of the BTC needs to do the same. It seems insane to me, because if we start using BTC in daily life for small transactions, the gains and losses are micro in nature and possibly huge in volume, in other words a massive bookkeeping PITA. 

So what's the solution? Or am I misunderstanding it?"
68,"Hello! I'm very new to Bitcoin and crypto in general and have roughly $5000 worth of BTC that I made from selling something. I do not have an ID currently, and also I would just prefer not to use an actual exchange to turn the BTC into USD.

I plan on cashing out around $3000 of the BTC so I can build a new computer, but I'm not sure the best method to do this. I know you can somehow sell BTC for things like Amazon gift cards, but AFAIK these can be """"double spent"""" or refunded so you're at risk of a scam ‚Äî and the entire point of me using Bitcoin in the first place was to avoid chargebacks and whatnot, otherwise I'd just use PayPal or something similar.

How could I realistically sell this BTC anonymously, while avoiding potential scams and chargebacks? I suppose if there is no great way to do this I could just try and use something like wire transfer, Western Union or something similar - though I'm not sure how safe this is with strangers. What are your thoughts?

Any suggestions or help is appreciated! Thanks a ton! :)"

""""Because it‚Äôs an asset, it will first be sold whenever you checkout with crypto and the cash will be used to pay the merchant. You have to report any gains or losses on the crypto sale on your taxes. PayPal will provide necessary 1099 forms when you sell cryptocurrency.""""

I don't need PayPal to tell me whether something is an asset or not.  The original intent of Bitcoin was to avoid kyc and other devices that the evil bankers and federal government have created.

We percieve it to be valuable because we believe it will be useful in that we can exchange it for goods or services in the future. And it only really achieves that usefulness because enough people percieve it will hold its relative value (perception of usefulness) between now and when they intend to exchange it.

To quote satoshi:

‚ÄúThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that‚Äôs required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.‚Äù

Current monetary policy is resulting in a trust crisis and people, companies and in some cases governments are turning to a system that implements trustless monetary. When we buy bitcoin we don‚Äôt have to trust anyone and we can have certainty that no individual, company or nation state can control, change or manipulate the monetary policy or integrity of the ledger.

NFT is a safe, decentralized platform to register and store our ideas. If someone with more money wants your idea, let them pay for it.  There is no jurisdiction to actually protect your intellectual property, our current system isn't full proof either.

133,"So I did the """"1% of your net worth"""" into bitcoin back in December and am very appreciative of the returns.  I took some of the winnings yesterday, but I am greatly bothered by the 4% total fee on the purchase and sale that I was charged by coinbase.   This amounted to several hundred dollars.  What if bitcoin did not go up, i would have lost 4% just in fees.

I thought bitcoin was supposed to be efficient, but this 4% fee is worse than what Visa or Square charges vendors for sales in dollars (about 2.7%).  And I wasn't even buying any goods.

Is there a better exchange with much lower fees (I would want to pay less than 1%)?"

141,"I'm looking for some advice please - I'm a fairly new long-term HODLer and I've made a few purchases through Binance and transferred these to a Trust Wallet.

In hindsight, I wouldn't have used Binance given the high fees, but it was the least intimidating option at the time and what's done is done, so we won't get into that! I'm now HODLing BTC, DOT, ETH and BNB with Trust (as well as staking ADA in YOROI).

I don't have much intention to trade again unless a major dip occurs and I decide to take advantage, but I do like having the freedom to check-in on my coins, have them all in one place and see how they're doing from time to time is a nice feature of the Trust App.

Is Trust a safe home for my coins or should I consider a different wallet if they're going to live there for a few years?

147,"Let‚Äôs assume all of the worlds currencies are rendered useless hypothetically and in anticipation of this everyone started to transition towards Bitcoin as their currency until eventually everyone used it. Here‚Äôs my question related to this, can the deflationary aspect to Bitcoin be a hinderance or a positive to it?

Let me explain, as you may or may not know Bitcoin slashes the number of bitcoins produced in half every four years and doing so increases its level of artificial scarcity. Increased scarcity drives the price up. So unlike fiat, if we had Bitcoin currency it‚Äôs purchasing power increases rather than decreases. Is this a good or bad thing?

Many have argued that this would be a bad thing, who would work if they could simply become rich by sitting at home doing nothing collecting Bitcoin, but I would argue that this assumes the deflationary aspect to Bitcoin hyper deflationary meaning it‚Äôs value goes up excessively every year. I don‚Äôt believe this to be true, as it scales it will become more stable. For example, it used to go up and down by 100% every day, now as more people use it this is not so.

Instead the likely outcome will be a gradual strengthening of Bitcoin by a relatively reasonable and stable amount. Having fiat with its inflationary characteristics forcing people to invest their money in real estate for example - prior to their money eroding - people will be Able to slow their speed down and save now and invest in the future as Bitcoin purchasing power increases.

People would be less inclined to take on debt compared to fiat, since under fiat you must constantly outpace inflation and if you‚Äôre trying to outpace asset price inflation like housing the only way to do this is by  taking on debt. So some might say it liberates people from being a slave to debt it would seem.  The main point of this post is to ask about whether or not the deflationary characteristics to Bitcoin helps it‚Äôs use case or hinders it.

Let me know your thoughts thanks.

148,"I'm convinced the future will judge on the separation of government and money as more important to humanity than the separation of government and church.

Was the government/church interaction needed to indoctrinate the population by mental control, the interaction of Government/money is used to physically use the population by enabling the system to rob the people from their wealth to benefit a few individuals that control the money issuing institutions and to unlimited funding the government that give these institutions that privilege.

The decentralized solution that breaks this pact between government and money issuers is the solution for a fair system that makes financial freedom available to the population.

171,"CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange that runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and enables uses to SWAP BEP-20 tokens in a trustless and permissionless manner. The platform is fast, cheap, and user-friendly. CryptoSwap Finance has many features such as farming, staking, and trading exchange that enable users to earn and win tokens. 
That is CryptoSwap in summary. In this article, we will look at the features of CryptoSwap and the problems it solves.

Blockchain and smart chain technology have opened a floodgate of innovation. With BSC, it is now possible to develop decentralized finance projects (daaps) with unique features such as decentralized exchanges (DEX), firming, staking, liquid pools, and lottery, which enable users to earn and win tokens in various ways. CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that offers these features, among others that that enable users to earn higher with the least transaction fee and high transaction speed.

Products:

1. Exchange/Trade Platform
CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that utilizes automated market-making (AMM) instead of the conventional order book. Users can trade various tokens on the platforms against a liquidity pool (LP). LP providers, who are exchange users, add funds to the liquidity pool and receives LP tokens in return. The tokens can be used to reclaim shares of funds, with a portion of the trading fees. The exchange has an intuitive user interface that even novice traders can use.  

2. Yield Farming and Staking
CryptoSwap Finance enables users to deposit and lock their funds in processes that earn rewards in CryptoSwap Finance Token (CSF), the native token. There are many pools where you can stake your funds. You can earn up to 20 times in reward with the main CSF/BNB pool. You can also stake your CSF tokens to earn a reward in other tokens. You can cash out the rewards or reinvest them. 

3. Lottery
Users can participate in the CSF lottery and earn rewards. To participate, use your CSF tokens to buy the tickets. Each ticket goes for 5 CSF. You can participate with a single ticket or buy more tickets to increase your chances of winning. The jackpot winner, whose ticket digits matches all the lottery number, earns 50% of the entire lottery pool. There is a reward for those whose tickets match 3 or 2 numbers. 

4. Voting
The decision-making in CryptoSwap is done through the voting process. The community members are allowed to propose ideas and vote on them. The cryptocurrency team reviews the proposals, move the ones with strong community support to the core level where the team determines the results, and announce it to the CryptoSwap community.

5. Initial Farm Offering
Users can buy tokens offered by other startup projects in a new sale model ‚Äì IFO. You can use your CSF-BNB LP tokens to acquire new tokens. After the sales, the project gets BNB tokens, while you get project tokens. CSF tokens equivalent to half the total funds raised are burned.

Final Thought  

The above core features of CryptoSwap enable the users to earn and win more tokens. The users can also directly take part in the voting process to suggest ways of improving the project. CryptoSwap is designed to ensure that the users obtain optimal benefits.

182,"Pardon if it sounds like I'm talking out my ass but our government is really hoping for MMT to work out in order for our economy to continue to sustain itself until things go completely back to normal. I don't know enough about the economics behind bitcoin, or economics in general, but it got me thinking.

MMT, what we're relying on for the economy to really continue to be propped up by the government as it recovers from the pandemic, is reliant on the fact that the government has complete control over currency.

While we still have a long time before BTC gets to that level, I think it is inevitable that there will come a time where BTC DOES rival the USD's status as a popular method of exchange.

That being said, with BTC existing in finite supply, and USD inflating every year, eventually (theoretically) there could be a time, who knows how long, where the USD is so inflated where it would essentially be worthless in comparison to BTC.

On the contrary, BTC's inability to inflate can also inhibit economic growth as a whole, less money for consumers to spend.

Are there any realistic alternatives that would allow for the USD and BTC to coexist? Or is it just fate for one of these currencies to collide? Am I just talking out my ass? If I am, why am I wrong?

Only way I realistically see BTC not supplanting the USD is for the government to flat out ban cryptocurrency as a method of exchange, would be hard to enforce but it would limit BTC enough back to where it was in previous years, essentially used exclusively for black market deals."

200,"Consider the following:

1. **Voltaire's Law:** All fiat money eventually fails (becomes worthless).
2. **Fiat money has lost the option to fail:** With Bitcoin around now, fiat money can no longer fail. If fiat money fails anyway, it will never be able to come back. 

Bitcoin does not even need to be particularly good!

Bitcoin is actually already much better than strictly necessary. In a sense, it is already overkill. Seriously, Bitcoin could even be totally lousy, if it wanted to be. All that Bitcoin needs to do, in order to take over, is to not become worthless in a bout of hyperinflation.

Imagine a boxing match.

Your adversary is much stronger and much better than you at boxing. He's got one problem, though: He runs on a battery while you don't. When his battery will be empty, he will no longer be able to fight. 

So, what do you do?

You avoid him. You stay away from him, and you just let him expend his energy trying to hit you in vain.

You do not even need to be a good boxer. In fact, you can even be lousy at boxing. You can have a very weak punch. It will not make any difference.

If the adversary cannot decisively shut you down, which he cannot, he will simply run out of energy and lose. That outcome is inevitable.

So, just patiently wait for Voltaire's Law to deplete the batteries of every single fiat currency in existence. 

Repeat after me: *The fiat adversary is done.*

203,Hi I'm tryna buy bitcoin but not sure where the best place to buy it is I have a coinbase wallet in which I hope to use for storing it but buying it is not so easy I was using binance but when tryna withdraw it it wants to charge me $31 NZD (0.0005) just to withdraw thinking about counting my loses there as I had less than that in binance to begin with Thanks in advance
204,There‚Äôs a lot of new players in the game at this point and all I have is a computer with a single gpu. Even if I were to acquire a few more GPUs and throw together a mining rig would it be worth it?
205,"Bitcoin is obviously going to draw in money from other asset classes like equities, gold, real estate, bonds, etc. Now, due to the nature of fiat currency and endless money printing from governments, people and businesses are forced to invest in these assets to preserve the purchasing power of their money. But has all this investment led to over valued assets? Is a 1500 sq ft home in a boring california suburb really worth close to $1 million? If Bitcoin becomes the preferred asset for preserving wealth in the future and takes money out of these other assets, then will we get real estate and stocks that are more fairly priced? 

Why do people invest in stocks anyway? I know corporations go public to raise capital, but why do individual people who buy a few shares even do it now that Bitcoin is here? Their tiny amount of shares is not going to have an effect on how the business is run and who is on the board of directors. They are purely in it for the returns. It just feels like Bitcoin is a better investment moving forward though. I guess there are dividend paying stocks, but not every company is required to pay out dividends, and Im sure there will be a way to generate cash flow from Bitcoin in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts?"

207,"I have only been putting money into crypto for less than a month. I am not putting in large sums of money by any means but I am right now DCA and am planning on continuing.  


My understanding is that if history repeats itself, that sometime in the next year, I have heard it's potentially 5-7 months out or maybe a little longer, but that there's going to be a crypto winter. (if history repeats itself) I understand it's possible that history won't repeat itself because of the institutional investors, and or that it may be less significant because of that.  


  
What are you doing?? HODL Through the winter??  


Pulling out before the risk of crypto winter and then repurchasing if it does go down??? and crossing your fingers that it doesn't keep going up?  


Would your strategy change if you had less or more money invested??  


I am watching my money grow right now in both BTC and ETH (Dunno if I can mention that here?) and I am really enjoying watching my money grow rather than stay the same/lose value.  


I don't know how I'm going to play it out. Right now I am putting any extra money in. I don't know what to do, whether or not I should HODL my BTC or if I should when in 5-7 ish months sell in case of crypto winter, and then buy back IF it drops.

214,"Ok so a friend sends me an old seed that he found from 2013 because he doesn't know what he's doing (trusting soul haha!). It's a 12 word seed and it also has a string that looks very much like a [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) identifier. I tried the seed in blockchain and electrum and no go. I dug further and most of the words are not on the bip39 word list. Anyone have any other ideas to try? Here are two of the words: descend, murder. Are there other types of seed word lists that have dictionaries?"
215,I can only imagine how crazy the internet will go if we can get Bitcoin to 69k on 4/20! Haha The King Elon himself would have to react. Let's do it!
216,"If we want to understand the future of Bitcoin, we should look at its history, its pioneers so you can make a clear decision.

I first heard about Bitcoin in 2013 from douban.com. Douban is a website for books, movies and music reviews and you can also form different groups. There you can meet different kinds of interesting people. We had a group called Primordial Evil and one was called Giant Goose. His real name is Xinyu Jiang, and he has a more famous name in Bitcoin industry - FriedCat. This name is less known today, but he was the first one used Bitcoin as IPO method to attract investment to make Bitcoin mining ASIC/machines as early as in 2012 in bitcointalk. In July, 2012, he founded his own company Bitfountain¬†in Shenzhen. One of the early investor was Jihan Wu, owner of Bitmain. FriedCat was the second designed and manufactured Bitcoin mining machines based on the ASICs made by his own company. And in early 2013, FriedCat mining machine first mined Bitcoin and his computation power alone consisted of 42% of all Bitcoin network. 

I didn't have many conversations in Douban with FriedCat back then. He has a Douban post which I had very deep impression. I think it was called something like Consensus between Libertarians and Conservatives. This is because FriedCat himself was a libertarian and he had some friends who agreed Conservativism in Primordial Evil. He entered one of the best engineering college in China - University of Science and Technology of China at the age of 15 in 2001. It was said that his college entrance scores was 11th among the millions of Chinese high school students. In 2011, FriedCat went to study in Yale for his computer science doctor degree. He didn't finish his study. Because he touched Bitcoin then and was fascinated by the Libertarian philosophy so he decided to quit from Yale and begin his business in Bitcoin.

As you may have the question, why you never heard of FriedCat in today's world when the Bitcoin price rising higher and higher. Well, that's because he suddenly disappeared at the end of 2014. There's no real reports, from internet articles, here's what could have happened: As the expansion of his mining business, FriedCat was trying to find the right places for mining. Then there was someone called Lin told FriedCat that he had the right place with cheap electricity. Then FriedCat put 6000 mining machines into this place and then Lin modified the account and hijacked all those resources and FriedCat tried to go to argue and might be kidnapped and forced to transfer 19000 bitcoins. That was how FriedCat disappeared from Bitcoin stage at least for now. 

Among the Primordial Evil, the most successful one was Zhongjing (William) Liu. He was the greatest historian in our century. And we can see this from his own life experience. He used to be a medical examiner in public security department in √úr√ºmqi, Xinjiang/East Turkistan. Then he realized the danger between Chinese and local Muslims so he left public security department and studied in Chengdu for history master degree, shortly after he left √úr√ºmqi, there was massacres between Chinese and local Muslims. Then in 2012, he went to Wuhan, that's right, the city where the Virus came. And he got his history doctor degree and exiled to US in 2016. As you can see, if he had stayed in √úr√ºmqi or Wuhan, what could happen. William Liu is now the President of Basuria exile government. He also translated and wrote many books including The History of England Hume and Macaulay versions. And his fans called his knowledge system Auntology. 

As one of fans of William Liu, if we use the Auntology view, we can easily explain why FriedCat failed and why will the bitcoin fails. Yes, from logical perspective, Bitcoin is a great concept. However, in the real world, the most important thing is blood. If you have your life, then you will have plentiful chances to make money. However, if you die, you don't have any chances for neither money for other achievements. Intellectuals tends to exaggerate their importance, but in real history, intellectuals are nothing. This world is ruled by warriors. And yes, sometimes, warriors are also intellectuals such as George Washington. But without force, any perfect ideas are useless. Take FriedCat himself as an example, if in normal country where good people have force, he can either use public or private forces to help him get back those 6000 Bitcoin mining machines. However, in China where the violence was controlled by Communists and gangsters. FriedCat was fortunately enough keep his life. It is said that the last post FriedCat shared in Douban was America: Imagine the World Without Her. Trust me, this was from his own life experience. 

So now let's look at the Bitcoin. It will fall. Because unlike US dollars, there's no force behind it to support this money. In free world, people who have gold usually also own weapons and ammos so they can prevent their gold from being taken. Besides, China has too many computation resources so they can commandeered all the bitcoin mining machines in China and forge the fake transactions so this money system won't be credible anymore."
217,"Ok, this will probably sound like a crazy idea, and it probably is, I guess I just got excited about the thought: what if some of the Bitcoin billionairs that already emerged from this thing put their money together and used it to buy a small piece of a country, you know like a free state. Something really small, but with a city, maybe from some third world country. They could then establish the first country in the world that uses bitcoin as their official currency"
218,"Are Altcoins eating free lunch under the banner of Bitcoin?

We all know Bitcoin is Digital GOLD.

In that sense, one of it's goals would be to capture a major chunk of Gold's market value.

Now some of these Altcoins really are valuable, but don't they are all significantly overvalued and even a bubble?

Utility protocols with unjustified price rises, taking cues from Bitcoin.

It makes sense for BTC too go to the moon but alts? They're pretty much like software startup companies with a Developer team releasing updates monthly/weekly and so on.

Shouldn't the valuation of Altcoin be limited to the products potential?

It seems the euphoria of Bitcoin is pushing money into alts for all the wrong reasons.

Let's face it, Dogecoin was not supposed to be 10 cents. All that money was supposed to enter BTC.

Look at XRP, valued over 75B whereas Ripple's valuation is slightly near 3B. Such large valuation gaps are testament to the crazy participants in Crypto markets.

TL;DR BTC was supposed to be above 200k today, FU shitcoiners"

223,Well they've decided to start allowing some crypto talk. It's interesting to see crypto swallow up the world! We're definitely living in strange times. Nice!
224,"Fungibility is the equality of all coins 1 BTC always = 1 BTC.. but is that under threat from Governments, law enforcement and complying exchanges?

Threat #1.  Coin origin.  We got that Jabroni Kevin O'Leary spouting out that the origin of coins will matter at some point.  """"Corporations"""" will want coins that they can track the origin, as to have 'Green' coins and not 'China Coins'.  Personally, I don't see it of that big of a threat... but when combined with threat#2..

Threat #2. Governments may try to force exchanges to lock assets if a coin was involved in 'criminal activity'.  We all see how exchanges are making you bend over backwords with KYC to get any money out.

We all know every bitcoin is traceable and coins are stolen everyday.  If you receive a coin in a Peer to peer fashion.. one of them may make it into your wallet... then when you go to cash it out, governments tracking the coins send a subpoena to the exchange and you're locked.

I'm not here to spread FUD, and I don't see this being a problem for the next year... but I am thinking ahead a few years when governments catch up... Governments can't stop Bitcoin - but they sure as hell can mess with the on/off ramps.

What's everyone's thoughts on this?"

(See the trillions of dollars injected into the economy as an example).  Getting excited about the conversion rate to USD is going against the whole point.  Bitcoin isn't designed to make money (it just so happens to be one of the best performing investments in recent history).  We should instead focus on getting excited every time that bitcoin gains more recognition and use in daily life.  Tesla, microvision, etc. Are just the start.  The near future will likely see this amazing currency being used for even more common purchases than buying a car.  Why convert BC to useless fiat when in 5, 10, 15 years you will be able to use it to buy the same things (and likely with significant more appreciation in value over the USD).  Keep your eyes on the long goal and HODL."

If there is value in massive amounts of decentralized and networked compute power, than having a currency that can be mined with all forms of hardware equally would be the best way to go. It should be more efficient, and you'd hope other uses would be possible with such a massive amount of compute power."

245,"I'm curious if there is a legal way to buy bitcoin with my business using pre-tax income here in the US, basically trying to do the small scale version of what these larger corporations are doing by putting it on their books. 

For example, say I currently own a company (solo S-Corp) that generates $300k in profit. If I converted the business to a C-Corp, paid myself a $100k salary as an employee (what I need to live off of), then purchased $200k of bitcoin that was owned as an asset of the company. Would that basically prevent me from paying tax on the $200k profit until years later when I sell the bitcoin and distribute the money to myself? 

Have any small business owners found a legal way to invest in bitcoin in a tax-deferred way? I was looking into mining but the IRS actually says that you pay tax on the market value of a mined bitcoin so that loophole obviously won't work."

American exchange you like best, for everyday practicality. By practicality I mean not so much user friendliness but rather maybe some in site regarding the crypto based cards. Are they easy to use &amp; witch ones do you like best?"
250,"I am looking for a service that allows you to buy BTC only with your credit card, without identity and residence validation.

Fast forward 2016, eth spiked from $10 to $16, and though I bought very early that, rather than making $400k+ I made only around 30k as I kept trying to day trade alt coins for big wins, and only hit once or twice. (Imagine how bad at trading I have to be to be that early and only profit this much)

Last year I settled down on a nice property for real estate, and the funds I have left over just isn't enough for investing as most of that was put into the new home. With the coinbase IPO, btc, and everything else going on it feels like I'm missing out on so much, and that there just won't be another time where the market is this obvious, especially with technology capable of predicting completely accurate patterns of buyers/sellers. What are your thoughts? Am I wrong? Will investing always be a thing, and opportunities like this will always arise?

It's just stressful because I'm missing out on so much while my friends constantly remind me of how much money they're making, and the current events being shoved in my face."

I‚Äôve fucked up...

Hello to anyone who sees this. I‚Äôm in a really bad place right now... I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this or even beginning to ask for this but I‚Äôm in the worst position I‚Äôve ever been in my life. I got into crypto and I had some extra money in the bank and was making some good profit, one thing led to another I started digging into my student fund, then my debt fund and so on. I made about $6000 in profit, only to then lose it all with over leverage and over trading and general bad choices. As you can probably tell I‚Äôm a beginner crypto trader, and I got addicted like a high to it. Was even trying today to flip my last remaining $10 into $100 to then try and turn it back to $1000 and so forth. I feel with even $500 I could have achieved it and made the money back but it was too late. [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/zacdavis1)I now have absolute no money in the bank no cash no money in my bank And I really fucked up, my parents don‚Äôt know yet because I‚Äôm at university and the accommodation which I‚Äôm staying in needs to be payed for. I gotta pay $4000 for that and then $1000 for the student fees in my student bank account. 
Im definitely going to stop trading and quit and wish never to return without proper education on it. I don‚Äôt feel like I can talk to anyone I‚Äôm literally broken and when my parents find out they‚Äôre going to kill me, I got 14 days left to accumulate these fees and I‚Äôm genuinely scared. I‚Äôm broken mentally and am feeling pretty suicidal if I‚Äôm being honest. I‚Äôm begging to a random Reddit post which I don‚Äôt know will ever make it out but I‚Äôm so desperate I have nothing left. I‚Äôm genuinely asking from the bottom of my heart if anyone sees this and reads this if they could make any small donations because I‚Äôve seen people making incredible gains and if a lot of people saw it and some gave a little it would all add up. If people did see this and wanted to send me anything, my PayPal is linked in this post. I can also provide proof to show that I‚Äôm
not lying and I genuinely lost everything. Thank you for your time[PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/zacdavis1)"

275,"Hello! I have just started getting into Bitcoin and crypto overall because I am in the process of selling something for a couple thousand USD and have decided that Bitcoin would be the best way for me to do so currently. 

I do not have an ID currently so I can't use an exchange myself. The way I hope it will work is that I would receive the BTC in my own anonymous wallet, somehow keep it as anonymous as possible, and then send the BTC to the CashApp of someone I know in real life who will then simply sell and withdraw all of the money and give it to me. 

I genuinely don't think anything would go wrong; there's nothing shady about my deal or whatnot, but I'm somewhat of a paranoid schizo who, in addition to being new to Bitcoin, has the burden of the real life person previously mentioned who is wary and doubtful about Bitcoin and CashApp in general (this has been a struggle, lol). So, I value the privacy and anonymity to a great extent. Which brings me to my main questions:

- What are the best ways to stay anonymous in general with Bitcoin?

- What are the best ways to """"hide my tracks"""" (for lack of a better term) regarding me sending the money to my friends CashApp? To essentially severe the connection between the wallet that I received the money on and the exchange wallet that I would send the money to after in order to withdraw?

- Which wallet would be the best for my situation? I would like to use a PC wallet as it's easier for me.

- What is the best way to hide my IP? Should a simple VPN, like Proton VPN, while using the wallet work well?

- If a buyer only has the wallet address that he sends the BTC to and no other information, is it possible for this person to track it and essential dox the wallet owner? Is it possible to see what type of wallet someone is using exactly, like if someone is using CashApp, Coinbase etc.?

Sorry about the long post and silly questions. I'm open to any suggestions or help! Thanks in advance! :)"

311,"Brian Armstrong really is just taking from the crypto community from today onwards, after the Coinbase IPO.

First of all crypto is supposed to be based on decentralisation and away from government control. Going for a public listing means it is under the mercy of SEC and can just freeze/hand over people's account/coins when a fed warrant shows up. 

More importantly, he is taking away the $100b market cap which should have gone to Bitcoin's $1t market cap, meaning we lost a potential 10% pump on Bitcoin.

Hence CZ's Binance move of tokenising stock trading is far better than Coinbase's securitising the coins/tokens platform based on stock, there is a subtle but very material difference between the two.

One avenue of thinking is well my 401k will inflate along with the rest of the money supply so i wont be super rich off it but it wont go to complete zero either.

326,"**E11even Miami** in the heart of downtown is known for pioneering many ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù in the nightlife industry, including being Miami‚Äôs first nightclub of its size open 24/7. Now, the club says it is securing another ‚Äúfirst‚Äù ‚Äî claiming it will be the first major nightclub in the United States to *accept cryptocurrency* as a form of payment.

E11even Partners hospitality group announced Tuesday that when customers pay for tables, drinks, or merchandise, they will have the option of using cryptocurrency. The company has partnered with a cryptocurrency processing company to process purchases using **Bitcoin** (BTC), **Bitcoin Cash** (BCH), **Ripple** (XRP), **Dogecoin** (DOGE), and more.

E11even says this new initiative comes as Miami aims to become the country‚Äôs next big tech hub, as numerous tech companies make their move to place their headquarters in South Florida.

‚ÄúWith the tremendous growth &amp; relevancy of Cryptocurrency coupled with Mayor Francis Suarez leading the charge for Miami‚Äôs tech boom, we felt it made sense to introduce Cryptocurrency as an option to our guests to pay for their night out,‚Äù Dennis DeGori, Creator and CEO of E11even Miami, said in a news release. ‚ÄúE11EVEN is dedicated to always staying ahead of the curve, and we believe Cryptocurrency is here to stay.‚Äù

337,"Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I‚Äôve noticed recently posts about Bitcoin have been about finally being super rich yet not understand that good things come to those before the big payoff sometimes. I guess that everyone forgot that there‚Äôs more to life than money. 

The real kicker is that, while it seems like we‚Äôll soon have so much money we won‚Äôt know what to do with every penny, the truth is it may take many years. 

Real treasure was always something of fairytales and even history books but many would have you believe all you have to do today is throw a few grand in Bitcoin like they did in 2013 and you‚Äôll have millions tomorrow. 

Treasure was the FRIENDS of those people who put real money into crypto and graciously allowed everyone to benefit with their generosity. The best aspect of this attitude toward Bitcoin is that it surpasses the utility of currency and becomes ultimately a tool of unity. I‚Äôm not trying to tell everyone redistribute your coins among all of your friends. I employ you to rather spread your knowledge. 

We are embarking on a new age of society. One that, although still rife with civil unrest and human greed, still struggling with issues past, is finally succeeding. 


There are many people who doubt this success and have honestly not accepted crypto as a necessary element of globalization.  

For those naysayers I say we have already had a reward far greater than money. A community so imaginative and uplifting that even traditional fiat economists would take pause to consider our newfound ideas. No, we are not here to ramble and deject as we may be at times I promise there is a shining light at the end of the tunnel. 

Well I will take that advice and not waste any more of  everyone‚Äôs time here. 

My advice to all who want to invest in their future altogether change the unfair hand that they were so dealt at birth is yes, invest in Bitcoin but be sure to enjoy the ride while you‚Äôre here.

At last, you will find wealth in the worldly sense and lots of time to spend it. But I know you will look back on the journey you took and think of the many friends now distant memories who helped you when you fell. Going forward you will smile and remember them well.

btc (price on friday last week) and then how much usd i put in ($ME)= this amount of btc on friday last week.

this is what I want to know and can think that I must be missing a huge something. I mean I'll make tons of money if ADA goes up 173X but should I just be bailing on those smaller things to basket all my eggs and when btc cools off again go back to trading every couple days?

358,"For long, people have been discussing how Bitcoin will decentralize the financial power Financial Institutions have over money. I think it is worth discussing how Bitcoin (or a new purposefully designed cryptocurrency) could and should decentralize the power The United State hold over the world as its currency is the Reserve currency of the world.

No single country should have that privilege. A country with 28.1 trillion dollars of public debt and a pesky habit of printing its way out of problems. This privilege has been leveraged during the pandemic with large amount of US printing was offset by an already existing global shortage in dollars. That‚Äôs why despite printing trillions of dollars during the pandemic, it hasn‚Äôt reflected much in the US inflation rate. And this printing looks likely to continue. If the Zimbabwean dollar were the international reserve currency of the world, they wouldn‚Äôt have faced such insane inflation rate for over printing. 

No single country should have the world‚Äôs printing press. Why should the largest debtor also be treasurer in charge of the money? The country with the world‚Äôs printing press can‚Äôt go into hyperinflation and if it does, it drags the rest of the world down with it.

In 1944 at the ending of WW2 when the Bretton Woods agreements were negotiated, British economist John Maynard Keynes suggested the issuance of a new international reserve currency called ‚ÄúBancor‚Äù, in the end American economist Dexter white‚Äôs idea of allowing for a greater role for the US dollar got adopted. Crypto currency could allow for the fulfillment of Keynes proposition, as it ensures no single institution or nation can debase the currency and not much trust is required to make it work as Cryptography ensures the trust.

Of course it would be difficult for Bitcoin in particular to be used for this purpose because how late all countries are to the party of a really limited currency (also means lot of people on here would be holding more of a currency that‚Äôs meant to be reserve currency than most countries will ever be able to access ). So best case scenario a separate fixed quantity crypto currency is agreed to by central banks of countries for this purpose.

TLDR: Dollar Should be replaced by an agreed upon CryptoCurrency as the New Reserve Currency of the world to decentralize the power the US has over the world and put an end to the US‚Äôs money printing privilege."

Last month I decided to pull the plug and invest some of my income into Bitcoin. After some study and help from you guys I got myself a hardware wallet where my Bitcoin is now safely stored. 

I do still have some questions. 

\- What determines the price of Bitcoin? Why does it go up and why does it go down? Supply and demand? If so, why do some experts think it will hit 100.000, 200.000 or even 400.000? What is that number based on? And why does an increase in price usually happen after a halving?

\- What happens if a person would cash out their bitcoin to an exchange like Binance or Coinbase. Where does that Bitcoin go? Back into the available Bitcoin pool? Or to phrase it a little better. If I cash out on an exchange like Coinbase, is Coinbase now the owner of that Bitcoin?

\- How can you calculate profit a.i. example ; I have 0.2837546 Bitcoin and the price of 1 BTC is 56.123 USD. What is the formula used to get the answer?

I am new to this cryptocurrency scene, hence, I have very limited knowledge about how cryptocurrency exchanges work. Pardon me if I am asking stupid questions. 

A few days ago, I purchased $20 worth of BTC from Binance to give it a try. Immediately after my purchase, I went to search my Binance wallet address on blockchain explorer to confirm that my $20 BTC was indeed deposited in my Binance wallet and didn‚Äôt see it. So, I waited for a few hours but this $20 BTC was not shown in the blockchain. I later found out online that it is likely that my $20 BTC could be withheld under the custody of Binance‚Äôs wallets (correct me if I am wrong). Of course, if I want to have ownership of my $20 BTC, I presume I have to transfer this $20 BTC to my cold wallet. 

A few questions started to form in my mind:
1. If everyone starts to withdraw their coins from Binance‚Äôs wallets or any wallets with cryptocurrency exchanges (after their purchase), would the cryptocurrency exchange be able to fulfil all withdrawal requests?
2. Is there a possibility that cryptocurrency exchanges could have oversold coins than what they actually own?
3. If there is such possibility, are there any steps which the exchanges have taken to ensure that such overselling would not occur?

Having said that, I knew that our banks are unlikely to fulfil all withdrawal requests due to fractional reserve banking. So I am wondering if the same case applies for cryptocurrency exchanges.

379,"Man, I wish I would have researched crypto more in prior years but that is relative to the information thats available in the media or those around you. Im currently pooling funds to wait for the next short term dip which I'm thinking realistically is around the 58k range. So far have been DCAing, and have a good amount but the recent growth tech downturn has left a bad taste in my mouth related to the ambiguity of stocks in the short term months to come. So now I'm really all more willing to put it on black and let this shit ride. I'll be making the leap to try complete 1 BTC, with that Im in for the long haul, HODL until my grave"

382," There are multiple criteria to classify blockchain. The most common classifications are based on the permissions provided to the users &amp; nodes to access, verify &amp; update the blockchain.

There are 3 types of blockchains based on permissions.

1. Public/Permissionless Blockchain - Everyone is permitted to read &amp; write. Eg ‚Äì Public Wifi.
2. Private/Permissioned Blockchain - Limited users permitted to read &amp; write. Eg- Corporate Intranet.
3. Hybrid Blockchains - A combination of public &amp; private blockchain. Eg - Banks are required to keep the ledgers publicly readable, but customers may demand privacy &amp; control of sharing data of their accounts or wallets, hence a hybrid model is suitable."

388,"Hey! Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit but the crypto mentioned will be for BTC. Apologies in advance if these questions are dumb. We‚Äôre complete noobs at this.

My best friend has been buying crypto and sadly shes so far left it on the exchange as she‚Äôs looking for a hard wallet.

We‚Äôre wondering if it‚Äôs worth an iPhone user to buy the Trezor Model T or the Ledger Nano X? She does not really trust the Ledger due to the addresses etc being leaked and it being a closed source so is leaning towards the Trezor Model T.

She will HODL so she just needs something that‚Äôll keep it safe (we‚Äôre both noobs so I can‚Äôt really advise her).

Is there a problem if the mobile support is for Android-only?

I found a few posts on reddit saying that they had problems using it on their Mac and people suggesting getting a new USB etc. It does make us think it‚Äôll be easier to use the Ledger Nano X? 

Also, just in case the same leaks happen with Trezor, she‚Äôs using her college address (where she stays currently) and not her home address as it will be a different address next year. She‚Äôs using a spam email and was wondering if it‚Äôs best to use paypal to purchase rather than a bank card that states her name etc? Although the problem with paypal is that it has her personal email address and I‚Äôm certain it states the address and name of the person on paypal. She‚Äôll change the address if she can to her college address.

We just want to maximise security even though we know it‚Äôs unlikely someone will show up at her door, but having a list of addresses etc online for anyone to see just makes us feel uneasy.

For anyone that says to search up on google etc and do our own research, she has no WiFi and due to phone issues I can‚Äôt use a lot of my apps including google.

Thank you!"

Looks like our recent log uptrend started in March of 2020.  And it looks like a similar pattern to the 16-18 phase.  Things got more explosive here in March 2021.  Looks to me like we have a solid nother year of gains before the next 'bear market correction' territory, moving then into the few years of consolidation and everyone complaining that Bitcoin is doing nothing, then another uptrend channel emerges and repeats the cycle.

Based on this I'd say we are heading clear of $100K this year.  Possibly aiming for $150K before we see a substantial pullback (30-40%)

392,"Hi guys!

To preface - I'm not an investor, or a specialist, or anything like that. BTC and crypto is largely witchcraft to me.

However, back in 2014 I obtained a small amount of BTC. I cannot for the life of me remember how or why, but I've found an e-mail from a service called VirWoX back in 2014 with the following:

*we have just processed your request to withdraw 0.139 BTC, and sent the amount to the Bitcoin address you have specified.*

It then has a Bitcoin transaction ID (I can provide if necessary).

From my e-mails I can also see I registered an account with Coinbase 2 days prior so I imagine I would have set that up and transferred the BTC to it? I've continued to receive e-mails from Coinbase over the years but nothing I can see in the way of transaction notifications. I gained access to this coinbase account but it's saying I don't have any BTC in there.

I was wondering if there's any way to track this down or figure it out, using the transaction hash or any other methods?

Cheers!

I recently thought though - I could put X percentage of what I still owe (an amount I feel comfortable losing if everything were to crash etc) in to bitcoin now, and trade out in a few months to pay the balance.

I want to stress, this strategy isn‚Äôt putting me in financial risk - my question is: I haven‚Äôt looked at exits recently.

407,"Does it makes sense at all?

Why or why not?"
408,"So story time: 

I've been researching interest generating platforms for my HODL savings and recently came to a decision to allocate a substantial chunk of my holdings to BlockFi (not really intending this post as a debate on the merits, lots of other posts on that topic...)

So anyway, I set up a new account, generate a deposit address, and open up Electrum, where I have the funds staged. Copy the deposit address from BlockFi noting, as ever, the ominous warning just below my deposit address QR-code along the lines of (paraphrasing) """"Hey dumbass, if you send coins to the wrong address, they're gone forever, got it?"""". 

Yes I've got it, not my first rodeo, but thank you BlockFi. I copy the address to my clipboard, paste it into the """"send"""" field. I browse current transaction fees and settle on a speed I'm satisfied with. I hit send. I see a warning prompt telling me that the transaction fees are an unusually high percentage of the amount I'm sending. What's that? Oh, silly me, I entered the amount in mBTC (Electrum denominates balances and transactions in 1/1000ths of BTC, FYI). No sweat. I delete the transaction and start again. Right amount this time, copy, paste, quick eyeball scan from Chrome to Electrum to make sure everything matches. Send. 

Then I see something in the Electrum """"Outputs"""" popup that makes my stomach drop through the floor. The address I see in front of me is totally different than my BlockFi deposit address. It's an address I've never seen before. 

My body floods with adrenaline in an instant. I'm overcome with a dawning sense of horror. Did I just shred the countless sats I've worked so long and so hard to stack in an instant? Did I just light half my future on fire with a single click? I feel like vomiting. My hands are shaking. It's BTC. There's nothing to be done... no one to call. Someone somewhere just got the gift of a lifetime... or astronomically more probably its just gone. My mind grapples for an explanation...

 That's when my sickened sense of dread plunges even deeper, as I recall: I had been poking around the blockchain earlier today, looking at some activity of interesting addresses (I like to play with some on-chain data for analysis etc.). I realize I had been copying and pasting a bunch of foreign addresses in Chrome just a few hours earlier. What if I one of those addresses was still on my Mac clipboard and I pasted one of them into Electrum? As if some Whale with 20k+ coins needs mine too... 

All of this is flying through my head at the speed of light, while my body is still being ravaged by coursing adrenaline and I'm imagining what my incredibly sweet but also incredibly crypto-skeptical father would say after haranguing me for years about how crazy it is to be your own custodian and how it will all end in tears... he's right. I think about how arrogant and self-satisfied I've sounded for the last x-years, telling everyone about how BTC is the future and patting myself on the back for my brilliant, brilliant insight and TeCHnoLoGIcaL GeNIus. I'm almost 31 and I just learned a child's lesson.... at a staggering, life-altering cost...

All of this transpires in the space of a few ragged breaths. As I gather myself, I start clicking through the Electrum interface in a mad frenzy, trying to make sense of what's happened. That's when I realize... My Electrum window is unusually small (I was looking at it side by size with my Chrome window) and it's placed near the edge of my Macbook screen so it's a bit clipped and the content is wrapping. I'm looking at the CHANGE address, and as I shift and resize the window I see that a small amount of BTC has moved to one of MY addresses WAY down my address list (the change), and that the main transaction has gone to the address I intended. A short while later I get an email ping from BlockFi telling me I have a pending deposit. I exhale, and get up to go change my underwear."

Corrections would then represent profits taker transferring BTC to institutions, perhaps lowering the percent correction of the pre-assumed future price dip for this cycle?

I created [**‚ÄúBitcoin is Dead‚Äù**](https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/) in hopes of playing a (tiny) role in telling its eventual story by tracking its most notable skeptics and documenting important pieces of its history. (Also as a longtime hodler, I think freezing cold takes are pretty funny.)

It tracks notable skeptics, quotes, dates, the price of Bitcoin on those dates, how much the price of $BTC has increased since, etc. and I'm planning on updating the database about once every two weeks. I made the [Bitcoin Skeptic Hall of Fame](https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/hall-of-fame) and another section called [Well Actually](https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/well-actually) where I cataloged the most common criticisms of Bitcoin and made rebuttals to each.

I started a twitter for some dumb reason for crypto related news. I liked a lot of the Benjamin Cowen videos. I followed who I thought was Benjamin Cowen on Twitter. The handle was intocrytpovese...missing an r. I caught that detail too late. I sent a DM asking for a sample of his sites premium content which I was thinking of paying for and got into a conversation with who I thought was Benjamin. I was instructed to open an account on [Cryptooptionsfx.com](https://cryptooptionsfx.com/)

, and deposited my BTC from my Coinbase Pro account to that wallet. The transfer was instant. Only after that point did I find out I had been fooled. I attempted to initiate a transfer of the BTC back into my Coinbase Pro account, but all it says is pending and has for a couple hours. Did I screw up and give away 6k worth of BTC, or do transfers sometimes take some time and it is possible that I can recover it?"

I keep following the bitcoin but just as a watcher, till last saturday when I found my old tablet, it had blockchain installed... so I start trying to access, witch was hard cause the tablet had damaged the wifi module and was outdated asf, I shared data with Bluetooth(very rudimentary I know), manually updated blockchain and somehow I remembered the pin.... It had 0.0074 btc, like 420 dollars, I know is little but in my country is more than the minimum mensual wage, that same day I cashed out 300 dollars (I know it wasn't the smartest), it was great, I won some respect with my family lol, spend like 20 bucks with friends (here is enough for a very good restaurant), and I was thinking about reinvesting the rest on interactive brokers but little did I know.

Today my parents where searching a medical email and my father just decided to search bitcoin in all of his emails and let me his phone to review it... I found two old accounts in different apps, I could recover one with 0.2 btc (11k at the moment) just with his email and phone number, the other one is still locked and may have more money(he said he probably lost the notebook with the password but it might be in his workplace), my father just decided to give me that money, he knows I'm going to reinvest or keep it on bitcoin, actually I think the smartest would be holding for a very good while, I wonder how coinbase IPO is going to affect bitcoin price, I'm so excited about this whole world and maybe my father find the rest of the treasure.

I found two old accounts in different apps, I could recover one with 0.2 btc (11k at the moment) just with his email and phone number, the other one is still locked and may have more money(he said he probably lost the notebook with the password but it might be in his workplace), my father just decided to give me that money, he knows I'm going to reinvest or keep it on bitcoin, actually I think the smartest would be holding for a very good while, I wonder how coinbase IPO is going to affect bitcoin price, I'm so excited about this whole world and maybe my father find the rest of the treasure.

I started buying very slowly at $20k and kept ramping up my buying when it was going higher, which yes did give less returns but also gave me peace of mind. I‚Äôm currently up a few thousand dollars which certainly isn‚Äôt life changing but it isn‚Äôt bad for a 19 year old. And guess what, if this thing crashes then I‚Äôll just buy even more.

What advantages do small blocks provide? 

And why are the transaction fees so expensive? 

Wasn't bitcoin supposed to be used as a currency? How will it be used as currency if I get charged an 8 dollar tx fee for a 1 dollar cup of coffee?    Will the lightning network change this?  Isn't there also a fee for opening a channel on the lightning network? 

From a beginner, I hear lightning network is the answer but LN definitely doesnt seem  beginner friendly and it also seems like it's always 6 months away from being usable. And then in 6 months it's still only 6 months away from being usable. 

I can't understand why the developers wouldn't increase the blocksize.

Why is this bull run so different as people say?  


 [Why is this Bitcoin bull run different? - DecentraNews ](https://decentra.news/why-is-this-bitcoin-bull-run-different/)

 

All those investments made by world-renowned banks and companies give even more credibility to Bitcoin as a store of value, but also the whole crypto ecosystem. I don‚Äôt think we can have another 2000% price movement before this bull run ends, which would put the price of Bitcoin at around $400K. As Bitcoin sets foot in the real world of finance, the amplitude of these bull runs will diminish.

 

I am not saying it cannot go to $400K in this bull run, but Bitcoin won‚Äôt x20 at every halving. That would be too easy and everyone would be a Bitcoin billionaire. It will stabilize until the adoption cycle has ended. The floor of the next bear market cannot be determined until we have actually seen the top of this bull market. But I think the floor will be much higher than what most people think. I don‚Äôt think we will see a $40K Bitcoin again."

\-----------------------------

What if I told you that Bitcoin is not money? Bitcoin is transactions.

Suppose that Alice, Bob, and Doge each possess 1 bitcoin. They have one piece of paper each, in which they have written that they have one bitcoin.

Alice wants to give Bob half a bitcoin. She writes this on her piece of paper and she tells bob and Doge, so they can update their own piece of paper with the transaction.

Now Bob writes in his piece of paper that he gives 1 bitcoin to Doge, and he tells Alice and Doge. 

Doge, who is the most generous, writes that he gives 2 bitcoins to Alice and he notifies the others.

Everyone‚Äôs piece of paper is now a ledger of transactions that looks the same, and it looks like this. 

If you calculate what this means you find that Bob has half a bitcoin, Doge has no bitcoins, and Alice has 2 and a half bitcoins.

Bitcoin works exactly like this. There is a digital shared record, a ledger, in which all the transactions are kept, and they determine the amount each participant has.

The ledger is kept by every participant independently. A participant is a computer in a network. Therefore there are many copies of the ledger.

But how do we determine if a transaction is real? If ‚ÄúAlice gives bob 1 bitcoin‚Äù is written on the ledger this should be a transaction created by Alice and not by Bob.

This problem is solved with signatures. The transaction ‚ÄúAlice gives Bob 1 bitcoin‚Äù must be followed by a unique signature that only Alice can write. In bitcoin, this is accomplished by something called a ‚Äúprivate key‚Äù.

If Alice writes a new transaction and she wants to sign it, her private key and the transaction are given to a function that outputs a signature, and this signature is practically impossible to reproduce without the private key from which it is generated.

Private keys are also used to generate public keys, which must be sent to the other network participants for them to verify the validity of the new transaction. The public key, the signature, and the transaction are given to another function that checks that the signature has been generated by the private key associated with the public key and with the transaction given in input.

Public keys are also used to generate bitcoin addresses, which are used to represent sender and receiver in the transactions stored in the bitcoin ledger.

Programs that store private keys and public keys and sign transactions are called bitcoin wallets.

But there is another problem: how do the participants of the network update their own ledger with the incoming transactions? In what order are transactions updated and what if there is conflicting information? 

First, we need to know how the ledger is organized: the ledger is divided in blocks linked together and forming a chain of blocks (a blockchain!). Each block contains some transactions and a code. The code is generated using the content of the block and the content of all the previous blocks in the ledger. Generating the code is very hard and uses a lot of computational power.

Let‚Äôs say Alice and Bob broadcast their transactions because they want them added to everyone‚Äôs ledger. The participants of the network, after receiving the signed transactions, generate a new block and they try to find the code for it, in a highly computation-intensive process. The first participant who is able to find the code broadcasts the new block to the network. The block is then added to the ledger of every other participant. 

Generating the code validates the transactions in the new block with ‚Äúproof of work‚Äù which means that computational power has been used.  The new block also contains a special transaction, which rewards those who found the code with new bitcoins created from scratch. Validating new blocks by using computational power to generate codes is called ‚Äúmining‚Äù. 

If someone broadcasts a block with a transaction that conflicts with other transactions, that block will be stored alongside the others, forming another chain of blocks. After a while, the chain that becomes longer gets considered the valid one. In this way, the group of miners with the most computing power decide which transaction history is the valid one because they will be able to mine new blocks faster. Therefore, the transactions considered valid are the ones with the most proof of work. 

In order for a single entity to break this mechanism, it would need more computing power than all of the other miners put together. As the network grows it becomes more and more practically unfeasible."

I've had a fair bit of Crypto stored on the hardwallet for 2 weeks now and nothing seems out of the ordinary.

Price predictions are riddled with propaganda, companies using their statements to manipulate trends, so it's hard to know who to trust, my head and gut says yes but it would be nice to have some nice honest predictions from data.

In come betting companies, these guys are not in the business of losing money, and make their money from betting commisions not bitcoin, so these predictions are going to be rigorously calculated and less likely to be intentionally inaccurate.

Specialist betting website Unikrn places the chances of bitcoin hitting $100,000 by the end of the year at 46% and the percentage rises week on week.

507,"This is probably a dumb question since I am a certified idiot but I heard today that 75% of mining is done in China, therefore many people see this as a risk to the network. I cannot imagine that China would do anything to disrupt Bitcoin mining, but in a hypothetical world where China sabotages the bitcoin network by shutting down major miners out of fear of devaluing its own currency, would the network still be able to operate in any manner with the remaining 25% being in tact? Obviously this would put a ton of stress on the system if all else was equal but I am curious as to whether this is an irrational fear or a legitimate concern? Thanks in advance! 

P.s I tried asking this in r/CryptoCurrency however it was removed for some reason. I have been asked this question by family and friends who are reluctant to get into Bitcoin out of fear of China attacking the network and I simply do not know enough about mining and the network capacity to know if this is a legit concern. Thanks"
508,"With more options for crypto debit cards and tax time it got me thinking about how purchasing with crypto will effect taxes. 
From my reading it sounds like every purchase using crypto will be a taxable event and was to be tracked for capital gains/loses. Which makes me personally want to stay away from the debit card and just buy and hold. 

Am I missing something or is that the current state?"

513,"Basically I have an emergency. I usually pay my mother rent every month due on the 17th. She asked me today to pay it today which is the 9th and I did not expect that. I'm not going to have us dollars in my bank account until tuesday because that is when I get paid. So I don't have the money that she is asking for. But I do have a ton of coin. So, my question is, how fast can I turn bitcoin on a ledger into money in my bank account to send? Also, another problem I'm facing is: its friday. If I sell bitcoin and transfer the funds from the exchange to bank account, would it even show up instantly? Am I screwed? Is there no way to get her the money on time? bitcoin maximalists, please don't suggest that I send her the bitcoin directly. She is not going to take that"
514,"Hullo, HODLers... 
Looking at the all time logarithmic chart, during previous bull cycles, Bitcoin has each time stalled for several (2-8) months at """"resistance points"""", 1st cycle at $1, second cycle at $200, third cycle at $3000, and now at $60,000. Each time, the high point of the stall has occured right below the low point of the next cycle, that is, post peak the low was $2, $200, and $3200. If this holds, that means the bull run will really get going within a few months, and the next post peak low point will be a bit above $60k! This is complicated by the fact that in the last run there were two stalls, the other at $5k, which brackets the low point. There appears to be a stall formed at $40k this run, so we can safely say that the next low will be between $40k and $60k. As an added bonus, each stall occurs at between 0.1x and 0.2x of the next high, indicating a high point in the next year between $300k and $600k!
Just a hypothesis, we'll see how it holds up in a few years!"

Kinda new to the crypto game.

Im looking to set up a DCA for small purchases from Europe, and would need some insights on which exchange would be best for me. My main options are Kraken or Gemini. I would love to use Coinbase because of the debit card option, bu are fees too high?

So what dictates Bitcoin price? The way it constantly fluctuates is dependent on what factors? For example, one minute it's 58 352 USD then 5 minutes later its 58 789 USD. Is there a mighty algorithm that changes the price depending on how many people buy/sell BTC every moment? What sorcery is this?

525,"[https://github.com/milkywaybrain/cryptogalaxy](https://github.com/milkywaybrain/cryptogalaxy)

Cryptogalaxy is an open source app written in Go, which will get any cryptocurrencies ticker and trade data in real time from multiple exchanges and then saves it in multiple storage systems.

Currently supported exchanges : FTX, Coinbase Pro, Binance, Bitfinex, HBTC.

Currently supported storages : Terminal Output, MySQL, Elasticsearch.

Market data plays an important role while making trading decisions and if we get the data from multiple exchanges, then really it is a gold mine. In the cryptocurrency world, almost all the exchanges make data available free. But there are a few problems, like, every exchange has its own structure of data, need to connect via websocket to get the data in real time which by the way adds more complexity by having to handle ping / pong requests, random disconnection etc.

Then if you are going for a service which aggregates all exchanges data for you, in most of the cases it is not free and in some cases, it is restricted by no. of requests you can make. Also, these services are just an API and you need to write code for storing these values to different storage systems by yourself.

Cryptogalaxy app avoids all the above said difficulties. You just need to create a MySQL or Elasticsearch instance and give credentials to the app. Then the app fills the data along with displaying it in the terminal.

Details of all the other features, configuration options, installation guide and architecture of the app can be seen in GitHub repo.

Thanks. Feedback welcome.

Out of the 7.8 billion people on the planet, approx 4.66B have access to internet. 

So let us say that a fully dilluted Bitcoin market means """" when everyone who uses internet uses bitcoin.""""  


(This is probably a flawed number in a gazillion ways, but what the hell, lets roll with it.)

So how many people hold bitcoin right now? Well that number was hard to find for many reasons, but the ranges that I found all seem to hover around 100 million people.   


That means that 2.14 % of every internet user is currently involved with BTC. This means that according to Everett Rogers """"Law of Difusion of Innovation,"""" we are getting close to the breaking point between """"Innovators"""" and """"Early Adopters.""""   


Did I get that right? If so, congrats to all of you; you are now officially Innovators, or Thought Leaders, depending on which economics textbook you choose to read.  


(BUT, if we choose to define a fully dilluted BTC market as something other than """"everyone on the internet,"""" these numbers will obviously be very different.)

I'm pretty new to Bitcoin. Just started this year, but I'm very excited about it. The majority of my BTC is on an interest-bearing account on Blockfi. I like that 6%!

557,"I have mixed feelings about this project, it is interesting for sure and got 700M TVL really fast so there are people that appreciate it (or just too much degens out there, i don't know)

So I might not be understanding it well enough, so looking to share what I know about it, what I don't understand and get constructive discussion going on where we all walk away wiser :)

So, their selling points seems to be.

1. 5 min delayed trades. You make a trade by sending the transaction to their contract with little extra ETH, because they hold it for 5 mins and then execute it using that extra ETH you sent (sending back the change if there is).  That is supposed to deter arbitrage bots and front runners because 5 mins is eternity in the arbitrage world and they won't be able to guarantee their profits.  They pretty much claim that arbitrage bots steal LP profits?

Two things I don't understand about this:

A. Won't that make the normal user experience much worse? Trading is not only more expensive because of the double transactions but the user might get slightly worse price too.

B. How do arbitrage bots steal profits from LP? From LP perspective it doesn't matter if one arb bot takes advantage of price discrepence and uses that opportunity to make a profit evening the price in the process or 100 retail users. Also they claim to use uniswap TWAP price, so if they use outside price they are not really AMM (x\*y=k) ?

&amp;#x200B;

2. They claim to have solved impermanent loss. That is a big claim. So pools can be in any ratio but they have 30% bonus if it's relatively balanced. So, people are expected to single sided deposit the asset in need and if they pool is relatively balanced all LP is get 30% bonus.  

What I don't understand:

A. If you deposit just single asset (not yet enabled but should be soon) no IL is kinda obvious. However if one asset drops in price a lot, the pool will have mostly the cheaper asset. So there might not be enough balance to retrieve your original deposited single asset.  So, seems like in extreme scenarios you still might be at risk?

B. If you deposit assets 50:50 you are supposed to wait for the pool balance to be in the same ratio as you deposited to get back the original assets in their original ratio, they call it cyclical imbalance instead of impermanent loss. And the 30% bonus for LPs to even the balance is supposed to eventually help. But will that be enough? A lot of people will just deposit the asset they have regardless they get 30% bonus or not.  Also what happens if one asset depreciates a lot compared to the other? Do you still get the same amount of each as long as you withdraw at the same pool balance ratio?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 3. They claim to have uniswap v.3 style concentrated liquidity but auto managed by them by observing binance order book depth and placing liquidity accordingly. This one I like a lot actually. It seems to be somewhat conservative giving you about 3x leverage of your liquidity, meaning that if you LP $1000 you should be earning fees like if you've LPed $3000 and it's hands free, you don't have to be professional market maker.

However little info is given what happens when the price gets of the price range they've chosen. From my understanding that would increase the IL by 3x as well, but they have solved it? So what happens? I really have no clue about this one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4. Last one is not that important but still, good to get some angles. They provide current APY based on $1B FDV valuation. This value they just got from the blue.  However considering that uniswap FDV is over $40B, 1inch FDV $9B, sushi $4B and we are in irrational bull market it seems in the realm of the possible? However, for that to work they need to have retail volume and I'm not sure how most users will see the 5min delay and more expensive trades (2 transactions), and without retail volume there is are no LPs and no TVL to work with.

5. Also couldn't find info if they are fork or made from scratch?

6. Kinda not looking great that over a week after launch trading is still not enabled, seems like they are sitll looking into stuff, which you'd suppose they have sorted out before launch.....

I peeked at BlockFi's fees to borrow against your hodlings (2% origination, w/ 4.5% APR) and created a simple spreadsheet to compare the two strategies. (there are others might be better than BlockFi, I don't know)

Let's assume: 

\-  your bitcoin reaches $1M value.  
\- capital gains upon cashing out = 35% (if you live in CA like me)  
\- you spend $100k year to live

Strategy A) """"Cash out"""", pay capital gains. Live off what remains.

Strategy B) Don't sell. Instead, borrow against hodlings each year, and pay off prior loan as bitcoin rises.

With almost all realistic numbers (e.g. interest rates rising to 15%, bitcoin returns as low as 2%)... Strategy B wins hands down in preserving your wealth.

I've seen many people announce moon on this forum, how they cashed out and paid capital gains.  
So... I hope this helps others consider options. It was very eye-opening for me."
565,"Yesterday, I had made a non-urgent transaction at 12sat/byte, which is super low and I expected the transaction to go through within 12 - 24 hours. But it went through 20 minutes after I broadcasted the transaction, that's really fast.

This means the network is not congested right now, wouldn't be a good idea to open as many LN channels as possible (that you can afford to lose) at a low fee in anticipation of the next bull run leading to sky high on-chain transaction fees?

566,"""""Bitcoin isn't finite in reality.   Bitcoin is mistitled.  It should really be called Satoshi.  Calling it Bitcoin is like calling the USD the USTrillionDollar.  Bitcoin doesn't have a supply limit in Satoshis.  Bitcoin has a stated supply equating to 1/4 of the world's current fiat currency supply, without even including the supply of the other 4,000+ crypto currencies.  

21 million Bitcoins is 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis.  Now for a quantitative analysis, equate 100 Satoshis to USD$1.  That is 21 Trillion units of Satoshis the equivalent in quantity to 21 Trillion USD (quantity, not value.)  The entire global fiat currency quantity, using USD as the quantitative basis, is 80 Trillion.  

That makes Bitcoin in quantity equal to 1/4 of the entire global fiat currency supply.  Now, consider that Bitcoin developers could split Satoshis into even smaller units--and then you'll realize Bitcoin really has no supply limit."""""

Perhaps it's not possible, who knows.

But I'm thinking of the transaction fees, it would not be practical to do any on-chain microtransactions, even today. To send a satoshi on chain, I would need to pay a minimum fee of 225 satoshis (at 1 sat/byte). Let's not get too technical where the smallest transaction is 5460 satoshis (to limit spam attacks).

Even off-chain layer 2 solution like Lightning, it would at least incur a 1 satoshi fee.

The only way this can be solved are **free transactions,** off-chain of course, by way of centralized services like how exchanges (i don't wanna name them) these days allow, but users need to have accounts with the service provider to send and receive payment.

579,"Disclaimer: I am not accusing RH or other exchanges of any wrongdoing. I am merely pointing out a concern I had and trying to see if anyone knows of information that would disprove it. I only posted after spending considerable time searching and being very surprised at how opaque the RH crypto operation is, overall, in comparison to exchanges of their size that have all sorts of technical info posted in public and easily accessible.

/start: TLDR

There is two problems that could be potentially happening right now.

1. People buying and selling billions of crypto assets, with zero impact on the price of those. In regular exchanges, they check the buys and sells from the source of truth, the blockchain itself, and adjust the prices based on that.
2. (Applies mostly for smaller coins) There could be more coins being traded than actually exist in the blockchain.

/end: TLDR

Blockchain was invented to guarantee transparency and give peace of mind about problems like that happening from existing fiat centrally-managing systems, but with trading-only exchanges like RobinHood, there is no guarantee of protecting against those anymore. I could be wrong and there is a page somewhere that has information that proves otherwise, but I couldn't find it, hence trying to pick up your brains by posting this.

RobinHood doesn't allow transferring coins in or out. Never had and never will (from everything they talked about so far at least). It only allows buying and selling.

Are there are any actual underlying coins at all anywhere in the system? For smaller coins in particular, does this mean that in theory there could be more coins traded than existing supply?

Is there an SEC regulation that mandates they hold actual coins?

Since there are no transfers in, how do they obtain the crypto they're """"selling"""" to you?

Do they have a wallet for each crypto currency? Is the app-only transaction volume public?

Does the SEC compare and verify the in-app transactions match with the wallet transactions for each crypto asset?

Is any of this public so anyone can go into the Blockchain and compare the RH buying/selling volume to that of the actual wallet on the Blockchain?

If the trades are naked, does that mean there could be massive buy and sell operations happening there that do not have any impact on the crypto price since no one else can see them? i.e. Buying or selling a billion BTC would be reflected in the blockchain and all exchanges would act and raise or lower the BTC price, but if the RobinHood trades are all naked, that won't happen. That, would be really weird. It would be like a parallel universe where the laws and supply and demand no longer exist.

The information they released is so limited and I couldn't find anything useful to confirm or deny my thoughts. Even assuming that RH was trading covered crypto assets, Is anything that could prevent anyone exchange from creating a fully-naked crypto exchange?

Many even saying that they had heard about it from their friends and were in the process of trying to better understand it to learn how to invest in it. To be honest, I had given up home on their generation a long time ago after always getting completely shut down every single time in the past when I tried to explain Bitcoin to them. But now, every single one I talked to now has said that they are going to start selling some stocks for Bitcoin, and a few boomers said that they'll sell all their stocks and bonds, and even divert new future investments into Bitcoin. These guys have the assets to put in hundreds of thousands, to millions of dollars into the market, but if they all start trying to buy at once, they will spike the market like we've never seen before. The demand among their generation is in the trillions if even just 10% of them fomo in, and every old retired dude with assets that I know at the moment is waiting for a dip to buy themselves some serious amount of coins. If this is even just 5% of the people in their age group are considering Bitcoin, then that's a hell of a lot of demand with trillions in assets to sell for Bitcoin. If they're anything like most others who hopped into Bitcoin for their first time, then they will likely begin an avalanche of fomo'ing in if Bitcoin starts running up in price to create new all time highs. There's no coincidence that gold lost 10 percent of it's market cap and Bitcoin went up by that same amount of value in market cap. And that was just the early wave of boomers. You can only imagine how fast this news is spreading amongst their generation now in the age of the internet, and how much faster it will continue to spread after they make some serious returns from next wave up they'll likely cause.

593,"Hello community people.

A few days ago I started thinking about an idea because of these absurdities committed by brokers and peer-top-peer platforms.

So, my idea is as follows. May we have decentralized peer-to-peer platforms, as well as decentralized brokers, along the lines of the bitcoin network. What I mean is that just as the network belongs to everyone who participates in it, so do the peer-to-peer and brokerage platforms.

And this is for an obvious reason, so that not even state authorities can attack them, it creators and developers can manipulate users. Because these platforms like binance or localbitcoins, sometimes they saw some sluts from the state, others block their users' accounts, stealing their coins.

Bitcoin and crypto currencies are incredible, but the problem is the means of transition from fiat currency to crypto currency.

My idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a way to facilitate this exchange, but that is safe. and that not even the creators can control after it‚Äôs already in use by the community.

Pillars of the proposal:

01- Be completely anonymous;

02- Totally decentralized, with no central physical structure;

03 - Control of the path in the community members, not in the creators;

04- Open source;

05- Terms of use and short and objective policy;

06- That cannot be kidnapped by governments;

07- That does not depend on the creators;

08- That each member has total control of his account, and only him, that nobody can delete or make modifications to his account.

09- Scalable;

10- Be a platform where you can trade other goods, and not just crypto;

11- with low transaction fees, which can be targeted to reward those who help to improve the idea.

601,"So in a conversation about how Proof Of Stake could theoretically reduce the huge energy requirements of blockchain.  Someone pointed out to me BTC would never adopt it because """"the community supports PoW heavily""""  

Another post I read said   


&gt;The  six largest bitcoin mining pools control about 95% of the resources on  the blockchain. That means that in order for any change to be accepted,  these pools have to adopt a new standard‚Ä¶ no one can force it on them.  Right now, their entire workflow is based on POW transactions and is  decently profitable.

 So i have a few questions about this  


&gt;The  six largest bitcoin mining pools control about 95%

Is this true? If so then is BTC just an oligarchical model. Sounds like its the same issue as traditional structures where the rich control infrastructure, and only make decisions that make them more rich.   


&gt; Right now, their entire workflow is based on POW transactions and is  decently profitable. 

So basically the argument against PoS is """"Rich people are heavily invested into miners...."""".

617,"Get know Fomero!

Fomero  is the leading double-spend tool for blockchain-related projects. It  allows you to test your application for double-spending.

What is double-spend?

Double-spend  consists in spending the same coins twice. This tool emits two  different transactions using the same coins. One of the transactions  goes to your target's wallet, whereas the second transaction goes back  to you. Once the second transaction gets confirmed, the first one is  cancelled.

Why should I care?

An  application vulnerable to double-spending allows anyone using this tool  to buy products and services with bitcoin, for free. From digital goods  to physical products.

Can I get confirmations before double-spending a transaction?

No.  This would only be possible through a 51% attack, where you would mine  more blocks faster than all the network miners, in order to create and  broadcast a longer blockchain (that would get accepted by the network).  This would be pretty expensive, however.

How can Fomero help me in protecting my website?

If  you accept crypto-currencies on your website, this tool will help you  to find out if you are vulnerable to double-spend attacks. Through  double-spending coins, users could get digital and/or physical products  for free by cancelling unconfirmed transactions.

627,"While we see a lot of Bitcoin news in mainstream media, one thing that often gets overlooked is the developments made to improve the technology. 

Bitcoin technology saw major developments and upgrades in the past year \[2020\] and has some promising updates coming in 2021. 

# [2020]

**Lightning Network:**

One of the key developments within the Lightning Network in 2020 has been Watchtowers, which makes the protocol more secure.

One of Lightning Networks' drawbacks is that it made it possible for users to cheat and claim more funds than actually allocated to them. The partner user can stop this from happening but it requires continued monitoring of the bitcoin blockchain.

To avoid this, [Watchtower](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/watchtowers/) was implemented which allows channel monitoring to be outsourced to impartial observers.

**Taproot:**

Taproot is supposed to be a major upgrade to the bitcoin protocol which would bring about huge improvements to the bitcoin‚Äôs scalability, fungibility, &amp; privacy.

Taproot would essentially make smart contracts look like regular bitcoin transactions, thanks to [Schnorr signature](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496), 

Using this will greatly reduce the transaction size giving room for more transactions on the block and increase privacy.

Taproots activation has been a topic of discussion for the past couple of months and various activation and consensus mechanisms are being tested.

**PayJoin and CoinSwap:**

PayJoin and CoinSwap are two protocols that were designed to increase the privacy of bitcoin transactions.

Currently, bitcoin transactions are not exactly private they are pseudo-anonymous, meaning with a little tracking they can be traced back to the user.

With [PayJoin, or Pay to EndPoint \[P2EP\]](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/payjoin/), the user sends funds to themselves while also receiving funds from the actual receiver. This tricks anyone tracking the funds to think that all the funds belong to the same person when in fact that is not the case. 

**Vaults**

[Bitcoin Vaults](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/vaults/) are a type of smart contract that will require bitcoin transactions several confirmations and a time delay to actually be spent.

This will time for the potential victim to reverse the transaction and get back the stolen bitcoins.

**Smart Contracts - DLC**

This update, designed for smart contracts, will bring about a change in how they operate when they rely on external data \[data that does not live on the blockchain\]. 

**MINSC**

 A Miniscript-based scripting language for Bitcoin contracts, MINSC would greatly simplify the creation of bitcoin transactions. 

# [2021]

**Bech32m**

It is expected that Bech32m will support Taproot and all future segwit based script updates. 

**Private Key** 

This [feature](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21201) will add an update to the bitcoin wallets through which users will not be able to send transaction(s) from their wallet if the private key is disabled. 

**Multiple fee rate request**

This [update](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21083) would bring about a change to the fee rate selection process that happens during the coin selection. It would essentially avoid coin selection from failing.

He mentions the internet being a Type 1 telephone system and English being a Type I planetary language amongst other examples.

690,"I understand that from a supply perspective bitcoin's production slows down suddenly every halvening  approx every 4 years, usually causing a drop in circulating supply. We can extrapolate from that, that if supply was the only part of the equation, we would expect bitcoin's price to keep rising as it has so far done every halvening. At this rate we could expect bitcoin's price to reach $1M in approx 2026 as  Bitcointalk User trolololo [predicted in 2014](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=831547.0).

My question is in regard to the demand side of the equation. Can we expect the demand for new bitcoin to increase from current levels? I am especially wondering that, as with most other assets such as gold and silver for example, there is a tangible benefit of holding 1 ounce of gold vs 1/2 and ounce of gold, or 10 ounces of silver vs 5 ounces of silver, as having double the amount gives double the utility in various uses. But my question is does double the amount of bitcoin really have double the utility? Is there a good reason why a billionaire would want to own a whole bitcoin vs holding half a bitcoin? Is there something you can do with a whole bitcoin that you can't do with half a bitcoin?

I don't doubt that if bitcoin replaces fiat currency, gold and/or other assets its value will rise to unimaginable levels as it takes over the perceived value of those assets, but how well can we predict how much bitcoin should ultimately be worth? Maybe it will only match gold and not overtake it, maybe it will replace gold and not replace silver, maybe it will replace gold and silver and not replace diamonds, maybe it will replace everything, maybe it will replace nothing.

So my question is, bitcoin's decreasing new supply is easy to predict along a halvening cycle and can be expected to get squeezed more and more, if circumstances don't change. But does anyone have a good way of predicting bitcoins future demand cycles?"

I am a 34 old from Italy, father of a young twins. I am relatively new to crypto and investment in general, however I made a huge bet to invest all my savings and then some loan I got when the babies were born back in December to Bitcoin. I bought at around 30k and things went well, I almost doubled my initial investment of 80k EUR (about 95k USD). A few days ago however I clicked on a comment on one of Elon Musk's twitter profile which seemed to be a genuine website, claiming that Musk and Tesla would 10-times my deposit in a promotion. I quickly sent out my fund from Coinbase and waited... After an hour or so, I became nervous and sceptical and realized I made a huge mistake. I am not able to retrieve the 3.14 BTC that I have sent. My wife is furious and I am devastated. My life is completely ruined. 

I made this message to alert everybody of these evil scammers (I have also attached a screenshot of the site that I sent the money to, but seemingly there are many clones and scams like this, so be aware).

Also, I would like to ask the crypto community to help mitigate my losses. I know what I lost probably will never come back, however I hope that people, who made fortunes in the past couple of months, can help me and my family. Therefore, I have created a new Bitcoin wallet, if you feel its the right thing to do, please help me.

Now having the ability to accept many types of cryptocurrency including **Bitcoin** and Etherium, WWFA welcomes donors who invest in this digital asset.

Great tax advantages: *Donating cryptocurrency* is a non-taxable event, meaning the donor does not owe capital gains tax on the appreciated amount and can deduct it on their taxes.  This makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency donations one of the most tax efficient ways to support WWFA.

I had emergency savings in place and also live a very minimal lifestyle, so have been able to save up most of the unemployment benefits and stimulus checks. 

My first foray into crypto was actually a small gift of Bitcoin from my boomer mother sometime pre 2017 (she was paid by a client in Bitcoin and had no idea what to do with it, and thankfully she‚Äôs just been holding it!). At the top of the 2017 spike I sold most of it to finally free myself from debt. Yes it would have been nice if I still had that now, but learning how to live debt free and how to build savings over the past few years was very valuable and I consider it an important part of my financial training that led me to the point where I am now. 

Now I‚Äôm just trying to resist dipping into other savings for more Bitcoin... my excuse is that I want to buy land within the next year or 2, so can‚Äôt gamble with the downpayment account.

""""Someone is already working on this threat, dont worry about it, it will be fixed, just hodl, buy the dip etc etc"""" Who? What exactly is being done?

I have noticed lately that the crypto space starts to become a cult on his own, just like the Trump cult. You can't say a word, thats because right away you will be banned, attacked etc. You really can't have a different opinion.

I have few logic questions and for the health of the crypto projects, they need to be raised and answered. This is crucial so in my opinion the community will grow healthy over time.

 And yes I do believe Bitcoin is the biggest invention since humanity discovered agriculture, but here are some important points.

- Who does regulate the 9000 crypto projects exchangeable to BTC, ETH, Monero? ( coins that can be exchanged to fiat)
- How many of these 9000 projects have fixed supply?
- Why unlimited supply coins are allowed to buy fixed supply coins such Bitcoin?
- Why the crypto space is not worried about the suspicious activity, thin air coin minting taking place in the alts comunity? 

Ps: nobody seem to care, well you should! This lays a lot on the future of Bitcoin, if nobody stops the way the it's value rises ( and so is the value of ETH and others), sooner or later there will be consecvemces to the crypto space. Don't you think?

I'll around 150‚Ç¨ in a few weeks, I'm a student living with my parents (so i have no source of i come except my father's job, and i know i can't keep investing other money for a bit).
My question is: i really don't want to spend this money on shoes or other things that I don't need, Is It worth it to invest such a irrelevant amount of money in Bitcoin?"
745,"When starting in the crypto sphere I found myself really lost. Not because lack of information available, but the opposite. It's now so full of information spread across blogs, YouTubers, news portals, etc, that I really didn't know where to start. Apart from that, the crypto world involves so many new concepts (at least for me), cryptography, economics, programming (solidity), peer2peer, consensus, mining, staking, and the list goes on forever..

I understood that it was imperative to start from the beginning, gaining knowledge one concept at a time‚Ä¶

So, if you're just starting in the crypto sphere, here are my 2 cents for a smooth ramp up:

1. First, read the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) and sumerge yourself into the rabbit hole! This is the best whitepaper I've read so far, so clear and so powerful that it really blew my mind and make me want to know more! Mr. Nakamoto, whoever-whatever you are, thank you!.. I've a theory that Nakamoto really came from the future.. but that's for another post.
2. Keep on reading. Avoid YouTubers and organice yourself in order to gain the minimum understanding before jumping into the mainstream information flow. My book recommendation as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9zl6mi4lcwr61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9829c6e3b858eed2bd3e5c73d6d019e94616f665

From left to right and from bottom up:

a) First, choose a book in your language and learn about blockchain technologies disruptive power. As you'll find so many new concepts and words, my recommendation is to start with a book about blockchain in your own language. """"La Revoluci√≥n Blockchain"""" or \*\*""""\*\*The Blockchain Revolution"""" from Don and Alex Tapscott does a great job in explaining the disruption potential of the blockchain... Fuck banks!

b) Go technical. If you're a tech lover, then """"Mastering Bitcoin"""" from Antonopoulus is the perfect book for understanding how """"the shit"""" works! It's so well written and explained that I even recommend this book to non technical people... Then, if you enjoyed Mastering Bitcoin, you should definitely read """"Mastering Ethereum"""", a book also by Antonopoulus and Gavin Wood (Ethereum Co-founder). Ethereum is just so fucking amazing that it makes me cry of joy the more I learn about it and the possibilities it brings towards financial decentralisation. One tip of advice, the Solidity (Ethereum programming language) version of the examples in the book are of version 0.4.xx, a little old, but that's not a problem as you can find the way around just googling what's not working.

c) Let's make money. It's all good, now, how can we make a little money while we continue learning? I started first gaining a little economics and financial knowledge with the Jack Tatar book """"Cryptoassets"""", the authors make a great explanation of the financial and economics intrinsics of cryptoassets. If you are already a forex trader, then this book is a great introduction into the crypto trading world.

After that general overview, I decided to go specific, so I grab the Nik Patel book """"An altcoins trader's book"""". This book makes and amazing job in telling us about the cryptosphere back in 2014-2017. Nik divided the book in two main parts, first """"a memoir"""" telling his personal story, and second """"a manual"""", where you can find a lot of useful information about fundamental and technical analysis. I personally enjoyed a lot the fundamental analysis part, it really teaches you how to evaluate potential in crypto companies. Finally, I decided I'd like to know a little more about technical analysis, for that the """"Technical Analysis Masterclass"""" from Schlotmann does a great job. Easy reading and well organised as a resource book you can grab anytime to look up for concepts.

\_

Once I've finished all my readings I felt ready to understand what the fuck all the YouTubers and bloggers were telling me. But above all, I could distinguish between good YouTubers and good information from the shitty ones.

Good reading first is mandatory!

Those were my 2 cents, or better, my 2 SATOSHI. Hope you find it useful!

To the Moon!"
746,"Not investment advice.

Am I Crazy? I truly fear rampant inflation. From what I understand, it gets out of control quickly. It damages societies -sometimes fatally. I think many asset poor people in the US are already experiencing this and have been for years. I see 3 major threats of inflation and I've ordered them from most to least possible.

1. Supply shocks from covid. I think the amount of goods coming out of factories and raw materials needed to produce those goods is shockingly low. For many, this has already driven prices up, but due to the massive lack of demand from covid, it has buffered the supply shock issue. With real life resuming in 2-3 months...I don't know how this plays out. I saw a post today about supply chains being effected for years.
2. Wage inflation-the simple fact is that while many people want to work, I find it hard to believe many people will choose to work for $600 week if the government is giving them $500. The cost of the bus/gas/dry cleaning out weighs this...plus you have to work. For many jobs such as food service/hospitality, some construction, etc, I see businesses having to raise these wages up at least 20% to bring in workers. I also foresee a lot of under the table work. Wage inflation could be the spark.
3. Stimulus-I think money printing actually has the least effect-I think much of this money was used already to pay down debt, etc. I don't see people emptying their bank account to get tvs. I do see certain industries-once again hospitality-exploding. I do think many will say it's money printing that is causing the inflation."

749,"I‚Äôm still super new to btc and how to treat it overall. I purchased a small amount around 6 months ago and I‚Äôve just left it but it had me thinking. 
I‚Äôve seen people use the saying ‚Äúbuy low sell high‚Äù or whatever it is which I kinda understand, but how does the average person treat their btc account? 

Do people do what I have done? Just buy a set amount and leave it? 

Do people literally treat btc like a saving account where they put in a set amount every day/week/month?

Do people ONLY buy when it dips significantly? Or does that not really matter that much when you‚Äôre already set on actually purchasing in the first place? 

Kinda weird question I know, as I guess it just comes to personal preference, I‚Äôm just wondering if there are little things I can do to make my outcome better (as I‚Äôm planning on putting in every few months but not focusing on the dips and rises and what not)

The price drop dramatically (like from $6,000 to $3,000) and stayed low for a month or 2 but then it started to gain momentum again and as you know is now worth close to $58,000. If you're gonna get into the crypto game you need to be in it for the long haul to make a profit. I purchased about $200 worth of BTC during the last major bull run when the price was really high and then a week later the market crashed and I was left with almost half of what I initially payed, but I held onto it and now that $200 is worth about $2,000.

That's why the idea is not to do it by myself.. there's simply not enough time to learn and get experience during this bull market.

I still have this idea in my head, that if I find a signals group, a reputable one, paid or not paid, that uses leverage on major coins (not super small cap speculative ones) and has a good track record, then maybe, it could work.

I know how easy it is to get rekt when you're a noob in crypto and in leverage trading, but in my head (correct me if I'm wrong) following signals from a solid group could be profitable. 

I came up with this idea after following a guy I met personally from Toronto Canada (now lives in Dubai) on Instagram, where he has posted screenshots of his trade signals during this bull cycle... the gains are massive. I thought, maybe it could work if I copy a few of those trades \*only\* during this bull market. The problem is that his membership is quite expensive and I don't know if he gets rekt behind the scenes (he still makes a lot of money though holy sh\*t).

780,"Based on this StackOverflow post: [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/64483](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/64483)

Let's say someone has 10 BTC from various transactions (Tx) which were 1 BTC, 2 BTC, 3 BTC, and 4 BTC respectively, and they want to send someone else 5.5 BTC.

It is my understanding that you cannot simply verify that 5.5 &lt; 10 and thus verify the Tx to be pushed into a block which will be mined.

Rather, you must find all of the previous unspent TX amounts that they received as inputs (someone else sent or change for sending too much) and select a combination of these such that their sum is greater than or equal to what they would like to send. From my example, that would be 2 BTC + 4 BTC (or 1 + 2 + 3 or even 3 + 4) - I assume that the system in place chooses the last number of unspent amounts that are closest to this amount, or does the account owner choose this?

If the amount of these unspent TX amounts equals the sum you want to send - great you get no change in return. Otherwise, you get change as a new unspent TX output. So in my example using 2+4 would give you a change of 0.5BTC, so now you have 0.5 BTC, 1 BTC, 3 BTC as UTXOs. Trying to spend more than 4.5 BTC would now cause the transaction to not be verified as all other nodes would see that you only have 4.5 BTC from your UTXO history.

Is my thinking correct? If so, I have a few questions I would love to get a better understanding on since I am currently working on a cryptocurrency project:

1. Does this approach come from the fact that BTC does not have denominations
2. Why is a UTXO system used rather than a Account Balance one?
3. Does every wallet have a UTXO history? What stops a user from editing it? Or does each node navigate the blockchain history searching for public key matching the transaction to find this history.
4. Double spending is prevented since only one set of transactions is approved at a time. Thus, if a user sends 5.5 BTC twice, and the first transaction is verified and added to the blockchain, the second transaction will fail since they do not have sufficient UTXOs now (only 4.5BTC)? If they had 20 BTC to start, then both will pass?
5. Miner need to first verify all transactions by their corresponding public key and above method of checking UTXO history for each transaction in a block. Then they can use a """"nonce"""" to find a hash for this block that starts with a few zeros using their computational power. Once they do these steps, assuming they are lucky enough to be first, they get a portion of the """"change"""" and some newly generated fraction of a bitcoin and the block they mined gets pushed onto the longest chain?

I have the big picture but just need a push in the right direction as I cannot see how all of these variables get put together to make the overall system secure.

Thank you for your time and advice."

I think someone said that the government won't back it because, dollars come from gold.. not from digital data..

so the US Dollar won't support it.

and if noone else does.. (other countries, etc.) it's basically... toilet paper, no?

What true monetary value does bitcoin, or any other digital currency really have??

I don't really understand it, beyond the hype.. is it worth buying so much toilet paper?

783,"Newbie here. How does alt season start? I have been reading and it says that as Bitcoin goes down in price, investors switch interest to alt coins and therefore alt coins like Ethereum rises. I dont hold Bitcoin but I have alt coins and every time I see Bitcoin go down it includes alt coins. When I see this I get worried coz I am afraid I may lose the value of the coins I have. 

So when Bitcoin goes down, other coins will go down in price as well then Bitcoin will become stagnant in price after that alt coins will skyrocket and rise? is that how alt season works?

Thank you for your insight!"

785,"Usually, when you bring up cryptocurrency to someone in a conversation they will say something like ‚ÄúOh, but isn‚Äôt that a very risky investment?‚Äù. Well yes, but actually no.
Sure you can lose money because of the volatility, but thats not my point. 

A year ago I started investing in cryptocurrency and my perspective on the risks involved have changed a lot since time has passed. We all know the feeling of FOMO, the risk of missing out on the gains you could‚Äôve made on an investment. The risk of losing a future you could‚Äôve had, an improvement of life. The fear of having the feeling of ‚ÄòOh well, if only I would‚Äôve...‚Äô Well. I‚Äôm not willing to take that risk.

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is, its a risk NOT to invest in crypto because you risk missing out the best life you can live. Its an escape ticket to a better future and not accepting it would be a risk of losing that what can be. Sometimes you gotta do something risky to play it safe, you know?"

Does the increase in hashrate mean that the bitcoin they will mine with also 40x? So per quarter they will mine 40 x 120 BC or 480 BC per quarter.

Payments have been about 1 minute during testing and fees are low. For example, a transfer of 20 uBTC incurred a total fee of 0.2 uBTC which we think is quite good considering the onchain fees right now.

We see the highest challenge around Liquid at the moment to be adoption as it is not really widely used at the moment. Actually getting L-BTC funds is also not super easy, we are using [Sideshift](https://sideshift.ai/btc/liquid) to fund our wallets which is okay but was not trivial to find. 

However, using the [Blockstream Green wallet](https://blockstream.com/green/) has been a nice experience overall and we will have as an option and see if we get any traction on it. Hopefully we will be able to report back on some adoption statistics later this year if anyone is interested.

Hi Reddit!

I have built a crypto trading fees comparison tool which covers maker/taker/net (maker + taker) fee rates across popular spot and derivatives exchanges.

[https://fees.dusktrades.com](https://fees.dusktrades.com)

FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, also tweeted about the tool:

[https://twitter.com/FTX\_Official/status/1378265508126986240](https://twitter.com/FTX_Official/status/1378265508126986240)

I'm a trader and I've always wanted a fair way to compare trading fees across exchanges with all their quirks, which is why I built this. It's completely free to use.

By default, you will see tables showing how fee rates are affected by 30-day trade volume. There are also options for custom volume and the reduced fee incentives offered at some exchanges (e.g. paying fees with BNB at Binance or holding FTT at FTX).

I'd love to hear any questions, feedback and suggestions. Are there any exchanges worth using that are missing?

I think i should use legacy address since i don't plan to make multiple spends and this address type common accepted, from the other hand the low fee of SegWit-nested can save much money when i will start to spend.

868,"Okay, so a very close family friend (not a scammer or someone with nefarious intention) would like to use a bitcoin service that isn't available in their native country (America).

As such, he's asked us to set up an account with a UK-based bitcoin company (Deribit) as we are UK residents. Then we'll give him the login details and he'll just use the account.

Is there any potential illegality to this? I can't find any particular red flags from my online research. 

I would just like to know if this would be an allowed and acceptable practice, and if there's any potential for taxation liability on our end as the account will be in our names. Any possible nasty surprises is my question.

Thank you kindly for the information."

870,"If the supply becomes so low I understand price should go up to keep the trading going.

If C -&gt; Me -&gt; A will the user pay 1 sat or 2 sat fee?

Where can I read more about this topic?"
872,"Let's find a consenus with reasoning. Will it be below 65K USD, between 65K - 70K, or above 70K?

My opinion is above 70K, as user base of BTC grows, both on the paying side, and businesses accepting it as payment.

Any polite and cordial thoughts and disagreements?"
873,"So Binance's fees had doubled. Days ago the flat fee to withdraw BTC was 0.0005, now at 0.001. 

It was expensive already but it will soon (already?) become prohibitive for most users. What I think is the worst part is that, by doing this, they make it less likely for users to withdraw (or wait longer between withdrawals) and the exchange will be in control of even a greater proportion of the circulating supply.

I understand this won't affect larger players, but it certainly hurts the retail investor.

Do you know how responsive is Binance to user feedback? Probably they won't care but in the end they might lose retail users to other exchanges. Or maybe not as they are the largest exchange ?

876,"This is something I've been thinking about ever since I got into crypto. Let's say you do everything """"right"""", you get a hardware wallet, you get a metal plate for the seed. Maybe the chances are low, but let's say someone comes across this metal plate. Maybe a visitor or a relative. They know what it is so they save the seed. You never know that they know and security is compromised while you have no clue. Who knows what happens next.

You might say """"don't have people in your life that you can't trust"""", but that's not always possible. Even people you though you can trust can turn on you. It feels like a risk to me, but maybe I'm just a cynical person.

What are your thoughts or strategies to make sure that the seed to your wallets hasn't met eyes with anyone but yourself?"

If governments don't back it up (i.e. China just made their own), what makes it worth holding on to?

I really didn't have an answer other than, the whole point was to decentralize from Governments and to prevent the coin from being printed. Then they turn on that and said, thats another thing, where is it? you can't touch it, and you still need to go through a third party company to pay for things such as going to Home Depot (a home improvement store) and buying a new kitchen cabinet, they use Flexa's checkout system which is assumed to have extra fee's attached to it.

906,Is there a site i can buy bitcoin directly with a debit or credit card no identity verification needed
907,"\- Currently roughly the same blocksize

\- Currently roughtly the same amount of transactions

\- 1/10 hashrate/difficulty

\- 1/10 of unique addresses/users

\- 1/10 transaction value

\- 1/20 volume

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at these metrics it looks like transactions are only cheaper because there is less hashrate.

Also 1/10 of users are causing the same traffic with 1/20 the volume.

&amp;#x200B;

Claim:

\- it is cheaper because of the change -&gt; currently seems not to be true

\- it will stay cheap because of the change -&gt; not proven

\- it will work with the change -&gt; not proven

&amp;#x200B;

Also it only has 1/10 of users with 1/20 the volume, so adoption wise it seems to be magnitudes less efficient.

&amp;#x200B;

Claim:

\- Peer to peer electronic cash

&amp;#x200B;

SPV can't verify transactions on its own, it requests info from full nodes. Therefore the system is only as decentralized as the amount of full nodes.

It never was peer to peer unless you have a node you aren't a peer (imo). Since SPV does not work without full nodes it also can't be considered a peer.

&amp;#x200B;

Meaning the average user loses the ability to be a peer and therefore the peer to peer aspect is completely lost.

&amp;#x200B;

What is left is an electronic banking system with interbank consensus.

&amp;#x200B;

But when you ask them why not choose any other coin with newer technology over theirs they will say """"because bitcoin is proven to work and is safe"""".

Considering all aspects of their change is completely unproven and there is no reason to believe it will work (actually quite the opposite) it not only makes no sense to choose their coin over bitcoin it also makes no sense to choose it over any other coin, so I literally have to see a single valid argument for their coin."

914,"Early on in in my Bitcoin learning I read about brain wallets and that they sound really cool conceptually, they‚Äôre pretty bad in terms of security. But after a while it seemed that most warnings assumed people would be making brain wallets like they do passwords, 12-18 characters and little variation. That got me thinking, how does a brain wallet of 24 words compare to a traditional seed? Logically, it seems that if I can choose ANY 24 words, that would be more secure than using 24 from the lists seeds allow. Allow me to pose a more specific hypothetical just as something to base answers on.

I want to generate a Bitcoin wallet using this method. I grab the nearest book to me and use the first non repeating word from the first 24 pages. This gives me ‚Äúof, have, coasts,turning, you, opposite, orbital, the, details, culated, now,bidding, way, stretching, firsthand, mission, is, toward, transmission, as, tikhii, orbit, curvature, its‚Äù. I mush those into one big sentence, turn it into a brain wallet, write down the title of the book instead of the seed, and put the book back on the shelf. How does a practice like this compare to a traditional seed?"

I won a scratch off lottery ticket in early 2019, started with 350k after taxes. I gave myself 100k for paying any debts and entertainment money.

I'm sitting in the six figures now and have a goal along with everything planned out from here if it continues at this rate. It makes a huge difference in my mindset knowing I'm not financially stressed.

I'm not religious by any means, and still am not to this day. But that night felt like too much of a coincidence to stay in the same mindset that I had been dealing with. 
The night it happened I essentially bought two tickets on a whim, and as I was walking back to my apartment on the 14th floor I remember doing that whole """"Look here, I'm not sure if you're real but you've given me a shitty hand my whole life and if something doesn't change tonight I'm going to ect"""" 

Fast forward 10 minutes then I ended up winning $20 on one of them and $100 on the other. I cashed them in, bought another $100 worth of tickets and won $100 again. At that point I kinda just shrugged at the effort of the night and bought an extra $10 ticket with my small bills left in my wallet and won the """"Jackpot"""". The cashier was much more excited than I was at this point because my only feeling was that of annoyance.

I was willing to do what most would call stupid buying Bitcoin in 2019 with essentially 100% of my net worth. But when you've fought suicidal thoughts for 10 years and are given easy money, you just sometimes have to take that risk if it means never going back.

The night it happened I essentially bought two tickets on a whim, and as I was walking back to my apartment on the 14th floor I remember doing that whole """"Look here, I'm not sure if you're real but you've given me a shitty hand my whole life and if something doesn't change tonight I'm going to ect"""" 

Fast forward 10 minutes then I ended up winning $20 on one of them and $100 on the other. I cashed them in, bought another $100 worth of tickets and won $100 again. At that point I kinda just shrugged at the effort of the night and bought an extra $10 ticket with my small bills left in my wallet and won the """"Jackpot"""". The cashier was much more excited than I was at this point because my only feeling was that of annoyance.

I was willing to do what most would call stupid buying Bitcoin in 2019 with essentially 100% of my net worth. But when you've fought suicidal thoughts for 10 years and are given easy money, you just sometimes have to take that risk if it means never going back. 

As for r/Bitcoin I'll always be one of you guys and when Bitcoin hits 1 million in 2030 you're all invited to the best Dave and Buster's night of your lives!"

They could just continue selling until their sell/buy is 2/1, then 3/1...etc. up to their risk threshold (a 'run' on that platform, everyone wants to sell at once). This would artificially inflate supply, and push prices down. The major platforms could use that to manipulate prices to hell and back."

929,"First of all, sorry for my bad english.

The reason why i started holding bitcoin was to buy a gaming computer. I was always aiming for the top tier rig.

I started with a couple hundred dollars, and right now I'm at a couple thousand.

But right now, i have a bad laptop, that decides to turn on only when it wants to, and i'm getting really stressed for it. 

My dad told me i shouldn't be """"not wanting to spend my money"""" in order to just watch the numbers rise up, when i really want to buy something i've always wanted, and that it's not good for us to do this.

So he gave me the idea of buying a medium tier gaming laptop, paying it in 12x. Which makes sense, because in the end, the bitcoin price rise would cancel out the money i would've payed.

So what do you think?"

936,"I figured I'd dodged a bullet with these guys because I didn't have the sign up/verification nightmare like on the other exchanges. Well they get you in another way. I just found out that they won't release my bitcoin for 30 days. I did an instant buy that normally releases in 10 days. My first one went smooth so I thought I would buy more this time. They don't tell you that over a certain amount, they hold your bitcoin for 30 days! They took their fee but they won't give me what I paid for. 10 days is long too but I thought ok. 30 days is ridiculous."
937,"The concept has many fatal flaws that are well known and do not seem to be solvable.  One of them is the lack of a reliable and efficient algorithm to find a viable payment path between two nodes that are not neighbors and don't have a common neighbor.  In a reasonably distributed network with millions of users, it is expected that such a path will have many hops, say six or 20.  For a path to be viable, all those channels must have enough capacity to send the amount in question.  But since the state of the channels is constantly changing, that search would require a huge number of messages, either during it or in preparation to it.

Another problem is fraudulent channel closures. After doing a series of payments through a channel, you can try to close the channel, and collect its balance, as if those payments have not been made.  Since no one knows about those payments except the two end nodes,it is up to the other node to scan the blockchain at  least once a day, and promptly issue a """"punishment"""" closure transaction if he sees such a fraudulent one, and hope that it does not get stuck in a backlog.  But your punishment will be only the loss of the remaining channel capacity; so it is worth trying once you have made enough payments to almost exhaust the channel's capacity.  Users who cannot afford to scan the blockchain (like all mobile users) would have to hire and trust the service of a """"watcher"""", and send him a message after receiving each payment through the channel.

There are many ways in which the network could be gamed or sabotaged.  For instance, you can negotiate a payment with a long chain of nodes, but drop out at the last moment.  You will not pay anything for that attempt, but all those nodes would have to temporarily reserve the amount for you, until the negotiation times out.  Repeat at will. The LN guys had decided to use a onion protocol for those negotiations, for privacy; but then the intermediate nodes will not know who you are and thus cannot blacklist you.  (The may have given up on onion negotiations, but then all intermediate nodes will know how much you are paying to who.   Unlike bitcoin addresses, LN nodes cannot be freely created, so the identity of users is much easier to establish.)

With a similar trick you can monitor all payments made through a channel anywhere in the network, or manipulate channel balances so as to force other nodes to take overly long routes, possibly through nodes that you control -- and that charge very high fees.

The LN concept assumes that nodes are mostly balanced.  That is,  over some given period -- a month, a week -- each user pays out through the LN as much as he receives through it.   It cannot easily accomodate a frugal landlady who collects $1000 a month from her 50 tenants and spends only $2000 a month herself.   Such unbalanced nodes would have to periodically send some of the excess money they receive to a """"bank"""" or some sort; but then the bank may easly be unbalanced too.

Another big problem is that you must lock in advance enough coins into your channels to handle all sequences pf payments that you expect to make or receive through the LN.   Thus there will be a lot of idle coins locked up in channels, not earning any interest.

In the original """"decenralized"""" LN concept, each user ould have to open several channels, maybe half a dozen, to ensure that the network is well-connected.  But if you have $600 locked into six channels, $100 each, you cannot send a payment greater than $100.   If you want to pay $350, you would need at least 4 separate payments -- assuming that the receiver accepts piecemeal payments.

Some of those problems can be avoided if the network is centralized: there is one huge """"hub"""" node, and every user has a single channel to it.  But then, apart from the """"philosophical"""" objections, the central hub will know all your payments,and can block them or overcharge for them.  On the other hand, the hub would have to fund its outgoing channels with many times the total amount  that users have locked into the incoming channels; and cannot use any of those funds for that.

And the LN will have all sorts of legal problems.  In the US, if you offer your node to serve as middleman in multi-hop payments, you will probably be classified as a Money Transmission Service; you will need the proper license and you will need to verify the identity of senders and receivers of every payment, and report large or suspicious payments to the gov.

When you mention one of those problems to an LN promoter, he will say """"ah,  but the LN will not be decentralized, it will be centralized""""; or """"ah, but the LN will not be centralized, it will be decentralized"""", according to the case.  That is why they have always avoided to describe a specific scenario -- """"N users, K channels per user, M merchants, ... etc""""  -- which people like me could use in a simulation, in which the LN would not immediately collapse.

The LN developers are aware of those problems, and don't have any idea of how to solve them.  But that does not matter.  Bitcoin promoters recruit their victims by telling them that bitcoin will be """"reserve currency of the world"""", """"Visa killer"""", """"replacement for the US dollar"""" -- but always in a carefully unspecified future.  So, the LN will """"work"""" as long as the people at Lightning Labs claim that they are """"working"""" on those problems, and promise that the network will be ready in that same unspecified future.  And those devs will get paid their fat salaries long as the venture capital lasts."

Whether those satoshis rain down all at once into those many wallets of the small hodlers, or they creep out over time, either way that would be one way to right the ship somewhat from the heavy weight of all this institutional money now pouring in from the Wall Street crowd and corporations, all of whom have bags of money to gobble up every last Bitcoin.

# What Makes Gemini the Best (Lowest Fees):

Gemini has horrible fees for Mobile + Web orders so a lot of people overlook them

The Mobile + Web fee schedule is the same and the fees range from 10%(!!) to 1.5% (not horrible but way worse than Binance's .1% and Coinbase Pro's .5%)   


[https:\/\/www.gemini.com\/fees\/mobile-fee-schedule](https://preview.redd.it/yk2r9r2g2lr61.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6c98d2cfa4ac457a624decbcba14cf17d2547ea)

Most people stop here - Gemini, not worth it, or Gemini is n00b exchange etc etc there are lots of YouTube videos like this

Buuuuuut if you look at their API fee schedule:  


[https:\/\/www.gemini.com\/fees\/api-fee-schedule#section-api-fee-schedule](https://preview.redd.it/bwpk9vv43lr61.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be591d25e1f103286d61085eb9b64d9ab0de455e)

You'll see that for most of us (it's even better if you're doing 1MM+ volume per month lol) the API fee is .35% for taker (already better than Coinbase Pro) and .1% for maker (equivalent to the best exchanges I've seen - Kraken + Binance) 

What makes Gemini THE BEST - better than Kraken or Binance is their 10 FREE monthly transfers

This is great for Bitcoin because it means that you aren't paying on chain transaction fees (like you do almost everywhere else - and the fees can be even higher than the market on chain price on platforms like Kraken) and it's even better for ETH and other ERC-20 tokens (like LINK) that have ridiculous gas fees. 

# Automation

What's great about using an API to buy Bitcoin is that you can fully customize when the script runs with AWS 

This gives you the full functionality of a Swan Bitcoin, Cash App, Coinbase recurring purchase feature without the ridiculously high fees. 

What's even better is the free tiers of Lambda Functions and AWS Cloudwatch (AWS applications used for script automation) are enough to handle the volume of running a script like this multiple times per day (more than anyone who is interested in simply stacking BTC would ever need to run) 

# Conclusion

Gemini + AWS is the best solution I've been able to find for lowest fee buys + transfers to long term storage. 

Assuming you buy $10k BTC per year this strategy will save you:

\~$190 per year + on chain fees vs CashApp 

\~$90 per year vs Swan Bitcoin

\~$40 per year + on chain fees vs Coinbase Pro 

All transfer fees vs Binance + Kraken 

If you are in it for the long run, do the math, see how much money you're wasting on fees by not setting up this API + automation for yourself :) - (or leave a comment and tell me why your solution is better, I really just want to find the best solution and would be happy to abandon this one if a better one comes along!)

I made a video tutorial last week on how to take advantage of this API fee schedule + Automation if you are interested.

**Summary**

* Block space is scarce &amp; a fee must be paid to incentivize miners to mine your transaction
* Wallets have several features to increase fees &amp; speed up """"stuck"""" transactions
* Your funds are NEVER at risk of permanent loss 
* It's best to be able to analyze the mempool and set your fee based on how urgent your transaction is, but high enough to ensure it won't be stuck pending for too long

**This is an important trend for miners:** a consistently full mempool means more consistent revenue from transaction fees.  In the future, the value of hashrate might fluctuate even more than it does today due to variance in transaction volumes.

Much like mining pools emerged to help miners reduce short-term variance in finding blocks, **hashrate markets** will help miners reduce long-term variance by enabling speculators to bet on BTC price, difficulty, and tx fee changes. 

Meanwhile, it will be critical to run well-connected nodes to construct the highest value blocks possible. And *trusting mining pools to maximize block value will not be advisable*.  **Enter Stratum V2:**

987,"Just wanted to share my experience so far in case anyone else doing research on interest-bearing accounts for their Bitcoin.

I learned about both Voyager and BlockFi through this Reddit community and decided to try out both at the same time. I put a couple hundred bucks of Bitcoin into each new account and let them accrue interest for a month, then attempted to withdraw a portion. 

Voyager - At the beginning, they deposited my Bitcoin transferred in from another wallet almost immediately. However, my small $100 withdrawal from April 1st is still pending in their system (even though a note on their app states sometimes it takes up to 24HRS to process). Furthermore, they still haven‚Äôt paid out the interest accrued from March account balance and it‚Äôs April 5th..

BlockFi - Was a little slower with transfer in from another wallet (~30 minutes vs immediate). But, they clearly notate on the app dashboard how much your estimated accrued interest is for the month and how much interest you have been paid thus far. On April 1st, they deposited the interest earned for the month. When I made my first withdrawal, I learned that you get one free withdrawal a month through their app (so no fees on this specific transfer which I thought was cool) and because I initiated the withdrawal on the weekend, they listed a date and time that the transfer should complete by, which was by 5pm next business day. The transfer was completed at almost the exact time as estimated. 

Very impressed with BlockFi and looking forward to getting the last of my test bitcoin out of Voyager, then moving forward fully with BlockFi..."

994,"This has been my first time buying bitcoin with Binance.US. 

I have noticed several negative things about the exchange and was wondering if anyone else noticed as well.

1) There is a minimum amount of BTC you have to buy per transaction. I had to keep adding money to the exchange so I could buy their $20 minimum. 

2) You have to have a certain amount of BTC before they will let you withdraw. I believe the magic number was .001 BTC 

3) This is the most important issue and one that makes zero sense to me. Why in the world are the fees so high to withdraw? I wanted to withdraw my .001 BTC and it was going to take about half of it which amounted to around $40 at the time. 

Obviously this is exchange is not good for dollar cost averaging folks who like to buy small and transfer to their cold storage.  

Anyone else know why the fee is so high and how to get around it for withdrawing?"

997," The script searches the web for cryptocurrency news, taking keywords as input and then passes those to a text sentiment API, analysing how many of the headlines are positive, neutral or negative. 

The idea is that the script will check multiple sources and then calculate a % for each of the 3 sentiment categories. That way I'll be able to detect how the media is portraying Bitcoin, or any other crypto that day.

I'm planning to integrate the output of this script into a crypto trading bot in order automatically buy or sell a coin the news are overwhelmingly positive or negative.

Just like with the Elon Musk bot that I shared a while ago, my thinking is that catching a wave before it breaks, you can ride it for a while. 

The only limitation as it stands right now is that you can only sent 100 requests/day through the websearch API, so I might end up replacing it with a different solution.

I remember also in 2018 Bitcoin stayed stable around some price which im not sure if it was 14k or 16k that was when all shitcoins started going up and up. Then Suddenly Bitcoin started to go down, needless to say that those shitcoins all dropped so hard that 99% of them still have yet to recover... 

Anyway. im thinking what if we are at the same phase?  Or please if im remembering something wrong please correct me."

10 years later the US Dollar wont be worth too much and I can prob get away with it at maybe 30--40% in terms of the real purchasing power of the dollar today. By then Bitcoin should at least be $500k USD.
