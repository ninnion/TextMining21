1,"so, like many i'm not 100% clear on how LN functions at the granular level - sometimes u have to jump in with both feet, so thinking about running a few nodes on testnet to learn, but want some advice on my potential setup.

I currently have """"an army"""" of ARM devices. i have at my disposal:

- 5 x rpi3 &amp; 5 x rpi2 currently mining XMG - just because i can :)
- 1 x odroid hc1 with 1TB mechnical HDD which is serving as both bitcoin full node (core s/w) plus XMG full node.
- 1 more ordoid hc1 with 1TB mechnical HDD which i can retask - it isnt busy :)

so:

- does each LN need it's own dedicated BTC node, or can LN share BTC nodes?
- assuming yes, is there any benefit or cost (in terms of processing or, well, anything) by running, lets say, 2 sets of 5 ln rpi + 1 hc1 btc node setup? thinking of classic app server/db server structure
- additional: are rpi zeros any good for LN? i've got 6 currently untasked ....

any feedback appreciated :)",3

The wallet service Coinprism will be shutting down on March 31st, 2018. If you are holding funds in a Coinprism wallet, you must transfer your Bitcoins and colored coins out to another wallet and/or export your private keys before March 31st, 2018.

*Export wallet keys*

Remember that Bitcoins and colored coin funds actually reside on the Blockchain and not on Coinprism, and will continue to exist after Coinprism is shut down, however you will need your private key to access them, which is why it is critical to export it. To do this, visit this page, and after logging in, export your unencrypted keys. You can then re-import or sweep them into any Bitcoin compatible wallet such as Bitcoin Core, Coinomi or Edge. This will recover all your Bitcoins and automatically uncolor any colored coins in your wallet. If you wish to retain your colored coin assets, you must use an Open Assets compatible wallet such as Colorcore.


Best regards,

The Coinprism team",3

After the 10th free transfer, you will get charged 0.002 BTC per BTC withdrawal or 0.001 ETH per ETH withdrawal at the end of the month. So if I made 20 btc transfer last month, they will debit my account .02 btc, thats like $20 per transfer. You won't know about the debit unless you check your account history, you wont get notification or email about it. Keep track of your transfer

&gt;This email is to notify you that Gemini will be collecting withdrawal fees accrued during February 2018 on March 1, 2018. 

&gt;As a reminder, effective January 17, 2018, we modified our Transfer Fee Schedule pursuant to our User Agreement as follows: starting on February 1, 2018, Gemini will debit your account balance for any withdrawals in excess of 10 complimentary withdrawals per digital asset per calendar month, and the fee per withdrawal in excess of 10 is 0.002 BTC per BTC withdrawal or 0.001 ETH per ETH withdrawal.

&gt;When we debit your account balance, you will see a line in your transaction history that says “a Gemini administrator has debited your account.”

&gt;These withdrawal fees align with current market prices for transaction fees on the BTC and ETH blockchains; however, Gemini is actively working on an initiative to make this a better experience going forward, including:

&gt;Indicating how many free withdrawals you have left per digital asset per calendar month;
Charging withdrawal fees at the time of the withdrawal; and
Using techniques like SegWit transactions and batched transactions to lower fees and save space on the blockchain.
&gt;Should you have any questions, please refer to the our User Agreement.

My preliminary analysis indicates that a trade war could work to devalue the dollar. China has been pegging the Yuan as devalued in relation to the USD since 2001 when they joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). This has had the effect of tilting the whole playing table so that goods """"roll down hill"""" more easily to the US and goods really have an uphill battle getting from the US into China.

Trump is not willing to start off fixing this by devaluing the dollar, so he's using tariffs. But could tariffs have a devaluatory effect on the US Dollar?

If so, bitcoin stands to gain ground even faster than it is now.

See here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-06/a-trade-war-road-map-for-fx-markets-take-cover-find-your-niche

&gt; “It’s a bit of a double-edged sword,” said Tannuzzo at Columbia Threadneedle. “The dollar should ultimately strengthen in the short-term against the currencies affected by the tariffs; in the long-run, it could stay under pressure overall because it has to fund large and growing current-account deficits.”

47,"GDPR – What’s Important to Retain
There are many important rules companies must follow starting from June 2018, that will actively protect customers against corporations data theft and abuse (ie, selling your data without your consent or creating complicated terms and agreements most users do not fully understand). I advise you to read through the whole thing especially if you (like me) work in IT, are responsible for an IT department or have your own startup; but there’s one single point I believe to be most destructive for many cryptocurrencies:

Yes indeed, each user has the right to be forgotten, meaning, all user data should be able to get permanently deleted. Let’s say if I chose to delete my facebook account, anything I have ever posted, commented, liked, etc has to disappear. It does seem simple when you own your own infrastructure, but due to one of the most important properties of blockchain technology being its immutability, you can already see the problem bubbling up.

Any platform that uses a distributed ledger to store user data (blockchain, Vitalik coin) is, by all means, screwed. There is absolutely no way around this. What if companies just ignore this new enforcement? Well, the fine is only 4% of your company’s revenue, up to 20 Million Euros.

So if you have invested in a project, own a project or are generally interested in better understanding how this market will evolve, please do pay attention to the following: storing any user data on any public distributed ledger is half-way to a really, really, really unpleasantly expensive outcome.

From the top 100 cryptocurrencies, how many can you identify that will face issues due to this new regulation? Platforms that hold user data in any form must assure there is a way for that data to be deleted. Let me underline this again: it means a big no-no to storing any user data on a ledger from where that data cannot be deleted.

What about other rules?
Other key changes can be followed without compromising the concept of immutable distributed ledger technology. If you want more information on the subject I highly advise you to read this article. All these points are explained brilliantly by the author. If you want a more in-depth understanding of how this problem could be avoided see this one. In short, you would have to consider off-chain storing of data; this is, centralized servers.

Now what?
Raise awareness, speak to members of projects where you’re heavily invested and try to read as much as possible on the subject. Learning is the only way you’ll ever feel safe. Your opinion is the one you should value the most, as there is no one who will look-out better for yourself than… well, yourself!

54,"Hi guys,

So long short story, i have a iPhone 6 which I recently got my hands back on. It hasn’t been used since September 2015. At that time, I was using on it the Ninki Wallet ( ninkip2p.com ) Bitcoin wallet. At the time I stopped using the phone I had 2.65 BTC on the wallet. In December 2015, Ninki announced that they are closing their doors and advised everyone to move their funds to a different wallet. Unfortunately I did not do so and now I am trying to recover them.

I have all the info necessary: offline recovery phrase, online recovery phrase and public master key.
The recovery script that they provide is:
https://github.com/Ninkip2p/ninki-recover
The main issue is that it uses a API for fetching data that does not work anymore ( chain.com API ), so when I ran it it replied with this error message ( Chrome console ):
Failed to load https://api.chain.com/v1/bitcoin/addresses/3GXJPPyKrtd7EZFjj6PsZfD13Rq4VCRrzo: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 405.

Now, I got someone to edit the script for me and they changed the chain.com API to chain.so API. With the original one, I couldn’t get past Step 4 in the recovery app - it just fetched infinitely; with the modified one, it gets to Step 5 but the only issue is that the script says the Balance is 0 BTC. Which isn’t real, according to my addresses page and the wallet history. I guess the problem might be the script can’t fetch the data properly OR the data is faulty?

So...I’m in need of help/advice? If someone can get this stuff sorted out I am willing to give 0.4 BTC out of the final amount. Thanks!

**Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)** 

Copied from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support """"Trusted Computing"""", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

A lot of people were finding it hard to wrap their heads around the tech involved particularly blockchain, to be honest I have not met a person that has 'got it' the first time they were introduced to the idea. 

Like email we don't need to know how an email works for it to benefit our lives so I started to think of what the USP's (Unique selling points) of Bitcoin are, how it will appeal to people and gain more mainstream adoption.

These are what I came up with;

**A store of Value**

**You're in control of your own money**, no one can peer into you account or impose tax levies 

**No boarders for transfers**

**No signup process, like a bank** 

**Access you funds worldwide once you have access to the internet**

**Decentralised, no central point of attack or downtime** (as an example, Instagram went down a number of weeks ago because Amazom web servers went down and no one could use their app)",3

75,"It been a few month now that everyone is trying to find reasons to the huge decline of bitcoin, even blaming the moon or corrupted cartel.
Although I really believe that the market is very manipulated by whales and that state actors protect their intertest (like we would do) and want to tame bitcoin as it is an alternative to gold which became almost 100% state owned after 1971 to suppress people's power to sovreignty. The cultural and religious calendar of people around the world certainly affect the market. And Mt Gox sell has surely something to do with the correction.
But a few weeks ago some banks, when the dow jones took its hugest it since 6 years, had margin positions instantaneously closed with billions of net losses. Now as I cannot give sources on this you have to believe me.
What I can tell you is that my first reflex when the crypto market started to trumble, was to cash out alts to consolidate my long btc margin positions. Took a huge loss on this but anyway. I truely believe that mixed traders, wall street and bitcoin, liquidated bitcoin to prepare the stock crises ahead. 
We wanted to know what would happen to bitcoin, now that it is a real market, if wall street crash. If my analysis are correct we can assume that bitcoin crashes before wall street and that bitcoin crash is a signal for wall street turning bearish. 
I hope that this lowering of the price + the huge bullish news related to the Lightning Network and Segwit will consolidate and increase the adoption among people and not speculator, which would in the long run turn bitcoin into a safe financial space and not the speculators far west as it is now. 
If wall street actually collapse, we could see bitcoin going way lower than expected, but I don't think that mc afees predictions are absolutely unrealistic. Especially if the hashpower continues to rise. So keep hodling, trying to outsmart the market now is very dangerous, if you are not a pro trader :p",2
76,"I just want to say as a Venezuelan that Bitcoin has been godsend, enabling me and many other Venezuelans ex-pats to send money comfortably to our families. Before Bitcoin, eluding the currency control of the government (more like theft scheme) was usually done by sending money to an american account (which made it troublesome for those in europe) and haggling (so much haggling with people who would give 10-20% less than what was shown at dolartoday). The best part is that localbitcoin is an actual free market, so no more haggling. Bitcoin cash usually tries to lure venezuelans with tips, but simply put localbitcoin's liquidity is absolute king. Localethereum has low liquidity which translates into noncompetitive prices even when the fees of Bitcoin were around 50$ per transaction. Localbitcoincash.org has not a single offer (I actually would like some competition) so BCH must be swapped for BTC in order to access BsF (there are other ways such as AirTM but fees are ridiculous). 

I feel the weekly volume will continue rising, sadly as more and more Venezuelans leave the country and send remittances to their families. I am always trying my best to teach other expats to use bitcoins as it is the current superior way to send money, of course this may change in the future, but right now, Bitcoin has become an essential tool to a great number of Venezuelans.

Bull run, they know it’s a matter of time until crypto is adopted on a large scale,they ultimately as of now don’t care about the price, the only mission these people have is controlling the market. Unlike fiat currency which has an endless supply, bitcoin doesn’t.They’re essentially getting weak hands to sell to increase their supply for future control.

To me, this seems to be not only two different targets, but also contradictory ones. In the fiat world, you would use a currency with a very precise gut feeling about its value looking at the goods you can buy for it, and you have lots of sources of information to see its (necessarily rather stable) precise value when comparing to other currencies. You would hold it only for the reason of being able to pay something immediately, and to keep your fortune when there is no better option at the moment. Whereas, when you want something which gains value over time, you would use shares, or houses, or rare old cars. Since I appreciate so much the underlying technology of BTC, it would be worth to see it really adopted by the public but it won't, given an average value change of 20 percent per day!

I understand that one of the essential targets of BTC is, that it must never be controlled by any institution. But, and this is what I am really convinced of, you must get rid of the soaring and the crashing, and of the daily 20 percent ups and downs.

The key question is, wouldn't it be possible to get an algorithmic solution for that stability issue?

The BTC community obviously has a lot of super brains. After the brilliant idea of implementing the LN, I think the next big thing you need to tackle is exactly this: get the BTC value stabilized by algorithms. Surely it must gain value over time when the community grows, due to the limited amount of bitcoins, but this process must be steady, foreseeable and without surprises. After you have managed that, I believe you will see lots of people adopt it as a means of payment instead of gambling, and these will then be lots and lots people who are not inside the technology but who are just using it for all the advantages it has. Smartphones are used all the time by billions of people because they are so terribly convenient, but how many of them know all the technology? It doesn't matter to them because it works anyway. I think a technology is mature enough for the really big world when a standard user doesn't need to know anymore how it works. The """"user experience"""" of using BTC for payment must just """"it's working always and everywhere"""", and the next key success factor is a very reliable stability of its value. 

Unless you want to keep it as something to gamble with, like betting on sports results or dealing with penny stocks. Of course the winners of this game will be at least millionaires at the end, but millionaires in fiat money, and this still ongoing gambling game will not cause any progress on the original idea of crypto currency.

TL;DR
BTC cannot work as a currency when it stays as volatile as it is. BTC brains you need to look for and implement an algorithm which stabilizes the BTC course against fiat money. ",2

128,"Lightning software is just beginning but mainnet progress has come quite far already! I wanted to introduce my node which I'm excited about and will continually be working on.

Skyrus is a dedicated node to provide liquidity and other lightning payment tools. Now with a mainnet wallet released, you can begin establishing real payment channels to nodes on the network such as mine. Here is a simple guide to begin creating channels to Skyrus via eclair:

First you will need to fund the wallet like any other bitcoin wallet.

1. Swipe to the leftmost tab in Eclair (""""Your Bitcoin Address"""")
2. There you can see the bitcoin address and can fund it in all of the familiar ways

Once a payment is confirmed, now you can begin creating channels:

1. Visit [skyrus.net](https://skyrus.net) to find the node URI
2. In Eclair, swipe to the rightmost tab (""""Lightning Channels"""")
3. Press """"Scan a Node URI"""" and scan the QR code on the site.
4. Type in the channel capacity you would like to fund with. (All lightning software is new and you should be careful not to fund too much!!)

Once the channel funding transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you can begin making micropayments. Channels you open with Skyrus will be long lasting as the node will be in service indefinitely and I work hard to keep it smooth sailing. This means you will be able to make very cheap payments even in times of high bitcoin onchain fees.

Of course feel free to ask me for any other questions regarding the node or other lightning network questions in general. :D",3

Fraud is rampant and companies go bankrupt because of it even as management enriches itself. And the stocks have no intrinsic value -- today they are just notations in an electronic database.

MY family whos been in stocks all their life doesnt even want to believe and thinks that its possible for such huge volotility without heavy manipulation. So how do I survive in this market? Is this market even for regular joes or is it a war of the rich with us being used as pawns paying for all whales fees and expenses?",1
138,"Hello, friends. 

I finally got access to Robinhood, so I’ll try to list the pros and cons of each and then it’d be great to hear some community feedback as well. They both offer streamlined apps, instant deposits/trades, and no commission fees. Pricing data is below, along with what the “fees” would work out to be when compared to actual market values. 

But first though, I’d like to address all the people calling these apps “scams” because you can’t withdraw your crypto to a wallet or have access to the private keys. Yet. I guess the question I’d ask is how distrusting of entities do you want to be. Admittedly, I didn’t lose anything when Mt. Gox was hacked. Or Parity, or any other exchange. So I don’t have the paranoia that many in the community have over losing their crypto. But I’ve determined that as a simple investor, I have zero use for having that kind of direct control over keys or coins. I’m ok with someone else holding them, and from what I understand both companies utilize cold storage to some degree, as well as other security protocols. Also their commission-free trading, although slightly above market price, is nothing to scoff at. Neither are their instant deposits and instant trades. If I REALLY want to transfer to an external wallet in the future, I’ll just sell for fiat and do it through another exchange. Hopefully by then both companies will have an option to do that in the app. 

Robinhood’s announcement about offering crypto was honestly what got me serious about investing. Up to that point I didn’t like exchanges in their current state, especially their fees and convoluted verification processes. I’d been strictly a traditional equity investor up until late January when I read their press release, and I finally thought I’d found a platform I could start with. I got on the waiting list immediately, hoping it would be released in February as stated. Wishful thinking, I guess. 

February came and went, and I was angry that I’d checked the app every morning for a month straight for nothing. I was so worried that I’d “miss the moon,” oh boy was I wrong. If I’d just waited until it was released, I actually could’ve saved a lot of money not chasing the dip. 

Anyway, buying experience: once you’ve been onboarded and allowed to trade crypto, it’s as simple as selecting your coin and tapping buy. You’ll be asked to enter an amount, followed by a user agreement and then in my case being told I couldn’t do a market buy and had to do a limit buy. I’m still new to this scene and unclear about the specifics of this, but just be aware that Robinhood specifies market and limit orders and may restrict which you can use, depending on how much you’re investing. I’d say overall it was a painless transaction and I started tracking my holding immediately. Graphs can be manipulated to show specific prices at certain times, and I’m sure many will appreciate the market vs limit order options. 

Circle Invest became available mid-March, and I was ecstatic about it because of my fury over Robinhood’s betrayal. If Robinhood is supposed to be a bare-bones exchange, Circle is just a bone. It’s extremely basic, doesn’t allow limit orders and its “graphs” aren’t useful for anything besides looking at the squiggly line and saying hmmm, that looks bearish. Having said that, onboarding could not have been faster or easier, and I was hodling coins less than 5 minutes after I downloaded it. 

Circle allows for $10,000 of instant deposits from your bank a week, vs Robinhood’s $1,000 a day. Circle’s prices are also higher than Robinhood’s. At the time of writing here are their prices and fees compared to the independent BitcoinAverage, which were recorded as simultaneously as possible: 

BitcoinAverage BTC price: 6778.55

Robinhood Crypto BTC list price: 6774.94
RC BTC buy price: 6784.81 (.0009% fee)
RC BTC sell price: 6761.09 (.0026% fee) 
Total fee: .0035%

Circle Invest BTC list price: 6842.52
CI BTC buy price: 6842.52 (.0094% fee)
CI BTC sell price: 6700.89 (.0116% fee) 
Total fee: .021% 

BitcoinAverage ETH price: 376.71

RC ETH list price: 377.20
RC ETH buy price: 377.86 (.0031% fee)
RC ETH sell price: 376.63 (.0002% fee)
Total fee: .0033% 

CI ETH list price: 381.31 
CI ETH buy price: 381.31 (.0122% fee) 
CI ETH sell price: 373.74 (.0079% fee)
Total fee: .0201% 

According to my recorded data, Robinhood truly has lower fees than anyone else on the market. Period. Feel free to replicate my results if they seem disingenuous, although bear in mind it’s a tad difficult to capture numbers from 3 sources simultaneously. 

Note: the first attempt to compile these numbers was cut short when I realized Circle Invest had blocked me from depositing fiat and buying/selling crypto due to my account being “under review.” From what I could tell even though they’d confirmed a withdrawal from my bank, they never actually did it and therefore I was trading with imaginary money that they didn’t actually have access to. Not my fault, clearly system error, but they locked my account. Maybe I’d been making too many buys in a short time for their taste and they wanted to check me out, but this process took much longer than expected and I wasn’t able to trade or withdraw from March 28th until April 5th, until someone finally “manually reviewed” my account after I complained. Definitely an annoyance. 

So what has your experience been with either of these platforms? Which do you prefer? Which do you think people should use? How do their prices match up with your exchange of choice? Do you think they’re both stupid because you don’t control the private keys and don’t trust anyone? Fire away! I think once these platforms release more coins and allow for wallet transfers both in and out, we have a couple winners on our hands.

I have had this idea for a while now, so I'm finally working on it, currently the features are:

1) Add pairs from 4 different exchanges (Bitfinx, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Binance)

2) Alerts you on price above/below constantly unless u stop it

3) Price percentage change difference, this one usually is helpful when price suddenly goes up or falls, lets say we select btcusd pair and set Refresh Every to 100 secs and 1% price change, if it has increased or decreased 1% from last price in 100 seconds, it will alert u, usually helpful for an incoming pump or dump

4) If alarm is not important, we can just chill and see all prices in one screen refreshing every single second too

Suggestions are welcome

Firstly, this is my brother and he is so excited: http://i.imgur.com/OK52ErQ.jpg

I am a student in university and I have invested in bitcoin and other altcoins a big amount of money that I earned from another job. Because I am broke af for now (I have to pay a monthly loan that my family has), I borrowed my little brother 2.5$ to get out when I returned to my city of born. (my parents were not at home)

So, he was asking me for the money some days later and I proposed to send him 10$ in """"computer cash"""". I told him that he would be able to access them some years later and it could have a much higher value.

He was so excited and he is asking me to give him bitcoins instead of his coins.

From now on, I will send as much bitcoins as I can for his future. Maybe I give him access to the wallet when he will be 16 years or older.

It is time for me to start teaching him about internet, bitcoin and the blockchain. It can be hard, but I would be happy if someone taught me about bitcoin when I was playing counter-strike 1.6 24/7.

Friend is requesting help getting access to some BTC he forgot he had.

He used Multbit Classic wallet back in 2013/2014. All he has are a bunch of .wallet files for some reason, his BTC address and a 50-character password labelled """"Bitcoin wallet"""" that he found in his password manager (it's not 64 characters so I assume this can't be the private key so I'm not sure if it was used for Multibit - I never used the wallet myself).

""""Suomen Pankki"""" (SP) (Finland's Central Bank) may be considered a hero role model for other EU financial watchdogs to follow. Not only its officials have been closely monitoring crypto-currencies market for years, gradually deepening their understanding of decentralized digital money environment, but also bank's official statements are remarkably different in its measured and thoughtful tonality from wild, almost maniacal crypto-hunt reports issued by some EU financial institutions.

For example, in January 2014, in the wake of anti-crypto-mania SP published on its web-page the following testimony, which was surreptitiously named """"Bitcoin involves risks"""". Sure, as any other government backed, coercive, centralized financial gatekeeper, which job is to preserve the stability of the current fractional reserve monetary system, SP is far from being """"pro-Bitcoin"""" in it.

Still, when SP's communique says, for instance - """"Use of Bitcoin does, however, involve risks for the user, and its value vis-a-vis official currencies has fluctuated significantly."""" and """"The value of a virtual currency is based on supply and demand only. Authorities or other public bodies are not responsible for the purchasing power or stability of Bitcoin, and it can lose its value."""" that sound like reasonable, although, negative statements, which, however, do not try to invoke readers' fear or to speculate on public ignorance.

There's no surprise, then, that Finland today possesses one of the most crypto-friendly legal environment on the planet. Even though Finnish tax authorities fully tax all profits derived from crypto-transactions, virtual currencies are exempt from VAT. Additionally, you are not require to obtain a special banking license or to follow KYC rules in order to run a local crypto-broker. As usual, government's friendly approach to crypto-businesses is gratified by the surge of entrepreneurial activity in the country. For example, Finland, among other big technological companies, already harbors World's biggest P2P Bitcoin exchange.

196,"Even though the lightning network seems super cool solution to scaling, opening and closing payment channels take up space too. Currently with 1mb blocks the main net can handle maybe 7 transactions per second. If we assume a average person does 3 transactions per day, the main net can support about 200k users.

This is speculative at best but with the lightning network bitcoin can support about 50 million users if we assume that average user opens and closes a payment channel two times a year (220 million transactions per year / 4). This feels optimistic too.. So a block size of maybe 200mb + lightning would support 10 billion, which is ridiculous and from what I understand, increasing it compromises the original idea of decentralisation..

So bitcoin is only at beginning of it's journey and these problems don't exist in near future but are there any projects working on further scaling solutions or any ideas about this? Did I do the math right?

200,"**Who would win: The collective governments of the world or Bitcoin?**

People perceive government as an extremely powerful and effective entity, and this is largely true in many aspects.  Government is able to bring tremendous force against many entities to either compel them into submission or even destroy them completely. 

But in order to accurately understand the situation, you need to look deeper.  Governments are very good at bringing compelling or destructive force against centralized entities.  Corporations, organizations, specific individuals, and other governments are all entities that have reason to fear governments based on past evidence.

But what are some areas government is not so good at, or even areas they are exceptionally weak in?

Governments seem to have a rather big problem attacking things that do not have a centralized point to target.  The illegal drug market is one such example, certain terrorists organizations are another.  Perhaps even the Vietnam War is a display of the difficulties a powerful government has with attacking a distributed or non-centralized entity.

Governments also seem to have great difficulty knowing how to responding to disruptive change preemptively or even in a timely manner **with the appropriate counter response**.  Instead governments seem to respond after a threat becomes clear and does so with a response that is inadequate or even does more damage to itself than doing nothing at all.  The government response to 9/11 is a good example of this, with the creation of the TSA which costs that same government over $7 billion/yr. 

Also, government just seems to operate in a horribly inefficient manner generally.  An entity that creates [sinkholes of bureaucracy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/03/22/sinkhole-of-bureaucracy/) is especially ill equipped to conserve, adjust, and survive when resources are constrained or more generally to execute an effective counter strategy efficiently.

We also know that government gets a great deal of its funding through [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage), which would quickly be cut off as a revenue source if the dollar were to lose value.  If this were to occur, it would put the government in a situation where it's resources are cut off at the very moment they need additional resources to counter attack the monetary threat.

These are all ominous factors for the governments of the world when this inevitable confrontation with Bitcoin finally occurs, but I think there is another perhaps even greater factor that will tilt the scales to the point we can know the outcome of this conflict before it occurs. 

When Ross Ulbricht was arrested in a public library it seemed like a great victory for government and a display of their ability to strike decentralized targets (although this was only possible because of Ross' poor OpSec).  But in the wake of this arrest, I think we see some very worrying signs for the fate of government.  THREE of the agents (Carl Mark Force IV, Shaun Bridges, and a DEA Agent) that were a part of this investigation were charged with criminal activity relating to their efforts to enrich themselves with some of the seized bitcoins.  These agencies are not the local corrupt police force, but rather the FBI, Secret Service, and DEA--why would THREE professional and highly-trained agents switch sides and effectively go from acting on behave their government overloards to rabidly and greedily acting in their own individual interest.  I would suggest this is because of Bitcoin.  When you have a drug bust, generally speaking, most (maybe) of the cash and drugs makes it way through the evidence chain without individual actors siphoning off too much, but with Bitcoin there is no need to launder the cash or sell the drugs, it is just super easy to conceal with much lower risk for the agents getting caught (though not quite low enough for Carl Mark Force IV, it would seem).  In any case, Bitcoin seems to have a mysterious power to pull government actors away by tempting them to act in their own self interest.  In short, [Bitcoin lures government agents into defecting and switching sides to Bitcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoins-shroud-of-subtlety-and-allure/)

**So what do we expect will happen?**

As Bitcoin grows in size governments will eventually move to attack or kill it.  They will take this action too late (it's already too late), their action will be ineffective, and their response will eat up their dwindling resources in a time when their revenue stream is being squeezed by the bitcoin-induced fiat devaluation.  Among those government uses to lead and implement its response, many of those actors will defect and switch sides to Bitcoin perhaps like how King Louis the XVII kept sending waves of soldiers to arrest Napoleon who had escaped Elba until Napoleon sent him word """"please send no more troops, I have enough"""".

I see Bitcoin vs Governements of the world as a quintessential David vs Goliath event.  But like David vs Goliath, if you had looked past the surface and understood the situation correctly, you would have known [Goliath was dead the moment David stepped onto the battlefield.](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=243294593)",3

203,"Hey everyone! You might remember me from some of my other recent cryptocurrency articles, like my responses to certain anti-Bitcoin diatribes posted on Forbes. This time I'm back with something a little different: a response to a common, modern argument against Bitcoin. In this case I've used a recently-published Marketwatch article as a sort of metric, but the guy who wrote this is by no means alone in making this argument. The argument is this: if Bitcoin's price goes down enough, miners will abandon the coin and it will become worthless overnight because no one will be facilitating transactions.

Basically, I got tired of seeing this everywhere, and I thought it would be useful to explore all the technical and social reasons why it's wrong. For what it's worth, I *don't* think the article I'm responding to is clickbait - at least, not egregious clickbait. I just think the guy happens to be wrong.

206,"""""Ask not what Bitcoin can do for you, ask what you can do for Bitcoin.""""  –  John F. KenNODEy

I've slowly started to fall down the rabbit hole with Bitcoin.  I bought my first coin in early 2017, and since then, I have slowly poured a decent portion of my discretionary income into it as well as read most of the books on the subject.  I get it – I have a solid understanding of how it all works and how disruptive it will be.

However, I work in finance and would not consider myself great with technology.  I'm not going to learn how to code, I'm never going to be contributing to the open source code, and I'm not quitting my job to work for Coinbase or some crypto fund.  Aside from spreading the good word, I wish I could do something to help accelerate Bitcoin's growth besides laying on my couch refreshing my Blockfolio app 25x a day.

After reading """"Mastering Bitcoin"""", I started to look into full nodes and why anybody would even want to run one of these things.  Here is a good article I found on """"6 Reasons to Run Bitcoin Full Node"""":  [http://bitcoinist.com/6\-reasons\-run\-bitcoin\-full\-node/](http://bitcoinist.com/6-reasons-run-bitcoin-full-node/).

Here are the cliff notes:

1. Helps strengthen the network
2. You can set up a more trustworthy wallet on it
3. You can vote if a hard fork comes
4. Higher degree of privacy
5. It's not that hard
6. It's not that expensive.

I found the Bitseed 3 through some research:  [https://bitseed.org/product/bitseed\-3/](https://bitseed.org/product/bitseed-3/).  I was looking for a plug\-n\-play model where I could pay some money, plug it in, and be done with it.  It cost $359 in total.  I know most people are able to run a full node at a cheaper cost, but not being tech\-savvy, I needed something easy and ready to go.  I read a few articles and watched some videos and was able to plug it into my AT&amp;T router and open the 8333 port.  This is not a Bitseed commercial, I am sure there are other solid products out there as well.

So far, it's been great, and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I'd add on a few more reasons to run a full node:

7.  Relative to the amount of $ I have invested in Bitcoin, $359 is a small price to do my part to support the network.  For the general population, it is probably one of the best ways we can help.

8.  It will help you better understand Bitcoin.  To really see it happen \(block height, connecting to other nodes, propagating transactions across the network, etc.\), you get a better perspective of how things really work under the hood.

9.  Supposedly, it helps lightning network, as a stronger/bigger infrastructure can help support more/quicker transactions on the lightning layer.

9.  More nodes for BTC sticks it to BCH. \(suck it\)

10.  Its cool to rep the brand.  I put a Bitcoin sticker on the device, and it's a great conversation starter.  I see it like repping your favorite sports team memorabilia in your room.

You to girl at bar: """"Yo, wanna come check out my full node?""""

Girl: """"mmmmmyaaaa like sureeeeee""""

You:  """"Tight.  I can show you my Bitseed 3, too.""""

208,"BTC Jam ended up being a massive scam.   At first I thought it was acting a bit weird, then I looked in detail at my account.         

BTCJam closed last year suddenly.   What was alarming, is the amount of defaulted loans I had been awarded, nearly every Bitcoin i lent on the site went unpaid back.  That is fine, I understand that might happen, but then it got greasier.      

I looked into the arbitration notices I was awarded -  Arbitration notices from a """"lawyer firm"""" saying the debtor owes the creditor.  Well, that is where they used a fake law firm, a law firm that doesn't exist at all.  It's completely fake and the arbitration notices are completely useless.    

Then I looked back at what I was owed.  The account shows 3 important things - AMOUNT LENT, AMOUNT PAID, REMAINING BALANCE.  A simple equation.  Well to my alarm, the amount lent wouldn't line up with ANY of the remaining balances or the amount paid - BTCJam was spoofing these numbers to say that far more of the loan was paid off then actually was.        

I am not sure what to do but this seems  like a pretty big case of fraud IMO.   I understand the risks of using a Bitcoin lending platform, but it's completely different if a few users are defaulting compared to if the website was created to cheat people out of money with a fraudulent front.  And BTCJam was clearly involved with taking out money.

Bitcoin will create some of the most powerful people to ever walked the planet Earth. It will become a one world currency, a one world order. This is one of the final steps to achieving complete control over the excess population. Bitcoin pushes wealth to the wealthier, and traps most of the population into debt slavery. ",2
216,"So I was doing some research on the wannacry ransomware that happened about a year ago. This simply out of boredom on a sunday afternoon. Anyway what picked my interests were the 3 BTC addresses to which transactions took place. 

So while trying to learn a bit about blockchain transactions I inspected the BTC received and send. I mean if a criminal receives money on an address and eventually sends it to a different one then it is highly possible that the desire to withdraw the funds is present. Anyway this is not what I am here for.

The transactions from the paying addresses went to a couple of random addresses and this went on for 4-5 times. An example with non factual numbers: thief address received 210BTC from payments from ransomware. He send 190 to address 1. Address 1 send 160 to address 2 and a bunch to various others. Address 2 did the same with a smaller amount to address 3 etc. 

So each of these addresses had eventually the same address that received huge chunks. They had transactions inbetween with other addresses that had transactions with the first main addresses. 

All this confusing address BTC exchanges isn't related but it led me to a particular address that keeps exchanging BTC back and forth with the same address. I am talking about 100s of BTC's. Is this like a method for people to do? Or a strategy? I couldn't find anything about why someone would want to transfer BTC x from A to B to A to B to A to B to infinity. So my first question would be, why do this? Doesn't each exchange cost a small bit of BTC, making the address lose money? 

Looking down on the exchange numbers I scrolled down since I was simply baffled by the amount worth of BTC that was going around in these trades. Like converted... I'd probably never see that amount of money in my entire existence. But then I encountered an even weirder exchange. And I might not understand this fully but this particular address was sending BTC back to his own address as well? Like A sends to A and B to A and B, to A and B. And in between it received from like 100+ addresses a total of 800+ BTC which goes through the same routine AB -&gt; AB -&gt; AB etc. Why would a method like this be used? 

Look I am not looking to gain anything or so, I am simply just curious, going by the irregular timestamps it doesn't seem to be automated either. Isn't this extremely tedious? 

The crazy A -&gt; AB -&gt; AB address in question is https://blockchain.info/address/1EEqRvnS7XqMoXDcaGL7bLS3hzZi1qUZm1
The other address that was linked to my research is https://blockchain.info/en/address/3JjPf13Rd8g6WAyvg8yiPnrsdjJt1NP4FC?offset=150&amp;filter=6

I am not interested in my research, but simply in their behaviour. The research part was simply a backstory as of how stumbled accross this.

I think it would be very beautiful and the most moving culmination for bitcoin's history. 

I have read (haven't really made much digging about it) that Satoshi could own 1 mil BTC.

We keep this list up to date if you’d like to check back in the future as we’re always working hard to expand into new countries.

If you were to attempt to log into your GDAX account from an unsupported country such as Russia, your account would be temporary locked until you were able to verify that you were back in one of the supported countries.

We can only support countries where we have met the necessary regulations to operate. We are working hard to add support for more countries but we don’t have an estimated time for when new countries may be added.

Please keep in mind you can still use your Coinbase account as a hosted digital currency wallet to receive, store, and send funds.”

225,"In mid-2017 my siblings and I wanted to invest $50k into crypto through coinbase, which we did. Problem is we did it in a rush and only through my Coinbase/Gdax account since it was the account with the highest buying limit, because it was the oldest account. When they opened accounts it wouldn't let them buy any decent amount at once, a couple hundred each time, while mine had a several thousand limit (I bought some coins in 2015, plus fiddled in trading a bit in early 2017, so my limit was higher)

My question is, we want to seperate into our own Trezor wallets, but the record for buying these coins is all in my name legally. How do we legally change them to their names without resetting the Capital gains long term short term clock? Is it possible?

I'm afraid the only option may be for me to just sell their portion, and transfer the money to their coinbase accounts, for them to rebuy it in their names. But that would leave them having to wait another year for the capital gains long term rate to kick in if they sell.

After reading this article I was slightly enraged at the audacity of Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken. He made comments calling the office of AG Eric Schneiderman entitled, disrespectful, hostile and a waste of his time. This aggressive and overly defensive comment comes at an especially interesting time, considering Kraken's terrible customer service, which is openly criticized by thousands of people all over the world wide web. 
I have personally experienced this total disregard for customers and transparency first hand. Kraken seems to operate to a law of their own. From openly being disrespectful to costumer messages, to now denying and not recognizing what would give customers the very security that they are repeatedly asking for. 
Whether or not filling out the questionnaire for the AG is too much to ask or what their intentions are aside, I find it hypocritical of someone in charge of such bad costumer service to criticize anyone.  It is the actions of badly run exchanges that fuel regulators to come in and take heavy-handed actions. 
Just for disclosure: Kraken has been holding my 10k sent to a wrong address after a fork. Costumer service was basically rude, gave me absolutely no timeline on when I would get my money back and this is when they still answered support tickets. I haven't heard from them in months.

261,"Hey folks,

Without delving into the shitstorm of hell that my life became on April 10th, my brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack 10 days ago; he was 49 and this just should not have happened. 

Despite my being knee-deep in grief at the moment, I'm also likely going to be in charge of probating his estate; my dude lived  across the country in Colorado and had a home, a couple vehicles etc. that needs to be dealt with. He also owned a small amount of Bitcoin as well as two alts, all of which he was managing via the Breadwallet iPhone app.

Ideally, I would like to either transfer his BTC/alts to my wallet or (perhaps better for probating the estate) just gain access to his wallet and keep his balance as is. Even though he only had a small amount of cryptos, we were both really into it in recent months and I know for a fact that he would want to HODL rather than cash things out (I wish he was around to see the recent uptick). 

I have his phone, but his 14-word key is very likely hidden in some box at his house out in Colorado. We talked briefly about it when I went out to visit him in February but just changed the subject because again, this was not supposed to happen. I'm assuming my first step is going out there and digging for that, but I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on what the best course of action here would be. ",3
262," I've been following BTC and the cryptocurrency graphs, markets and news more closely for a couple of months now \- always trying to decide if/when I should buy \- and I'd like to ask a question that I know will probably be unpopular here, but absolutely legitimate.

It is said that BTC will go up a lot more in value as it becomes more widely accepted \(and traditional currencies inflate\) because it is limited in supply. McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \(maybe way more\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \- a couple quite successful among them \- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even """"better"""" one \- though """"better"""" is relative\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?

So far it seems to me that BTC is \(at least since I started following it \- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\) much more about speculation \(HODL\) than actual usage as payment \- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\+ in value at any moment.

What I'm trying to ask is:

If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?",3

264,"Let me preface this by saying I am a long term crypto enthusiast, I got into bitcoin in 2011 and I've accepted it in my own store since 2012. This is in no way concern trolling or me losing perspective after the most recent crash this winter.

I am simply getting more and more sure that we will never see that utopian world where bitcoin is accepted everywhere and even replaces fiat. I don't think it will die either, but I think it will forever remain niche, reserved for the (relatively few) cases it offers tangible benefits such as being simply unable to pay for something in fiat due to restrictions etc.

There are two main reasons. One is that the main differences of bitcoin which many consider benefits, is actually things that most people either don't care about, or that most people would consider disadvantages. Examples are the non-reversibility, and the total control over your own funds. People want a safety net, they want to be able to chargeback money in case of fraud, and they don't want to be responsible for keeping their own funds safe. With bitcoin, if someone forget a password, or get hacked, they can lose all their money. Most people would never want to use such a system. 

You may say that these problems will disappear over time as more user friendly systems are built on top of bitcoin. But then what is the point? If we have a system that uses bitcoin at the lowest level, but is reversible, and won't allow you to control the funds yourself, and charges fees, then why not just use a normal bank with fiat? You may be okay with such a scenario as long as you have the ability to use your own wallet if you want, but that's my point: I don't think they would allow you to do that. Payment processors would only accept payments through these higher level protocols that may be built on bitcoin but is reversible and requires trust and everything that bitcoin tries to not be. I can't see a way to have the advantages and not the disadvantages too.

The second reason is that even if the system evolves beyond my imagination and becomes ubiquitous in a way that also does allow you to keep all the advantages, society won't allow it. Financial freedom, financial privacy and censorship resistance is something that most people are willing to give up in order to fight crime. Even if you disagree, I think the majority don't, and that's why it will be made law. We're already seeing crackdowns with all exchanges requiring you to give up personal information and some blacklisting customers and blocking transactions for various reasons. If crypto grows in popularity and evidence is uncovered that it is in fact being used to finance f.ex terrorism (like it almost definitely will eventually, if it does grow in popularity), then it will only get worse. Relatively free countries like in the west probably won't outlaw it entirely, but heavy enough restrictions will be put on it to effectively remove its advantages over fiat when it comes to privacy, freedom and censorship resistance.

266,"I received this in an e-mail newsletter from strategictechinvestor.com



Dear Strategic Tech Investor,

In the special report I sent my paid-up members last week, I showed what it would mean for its price if e-commerce giants like Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) start accepting Bitcoin.

In short, Amazon's acceptance of cryptocurrencies would be a bit step toward the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin - and to a price of $100,000.

(I've figured out how Bitcoin could get there. To get my """"math,"""" click here.)

While in that report I predicted that Amazon would start accepting Bitcoin """"soon,"""" I didn't predict this...

Amazon just received a patent for a """"streaming data marketplace"""" that would allow users, including individuals or online retailers, to receive real-time cryptocurrency transaction data.

Now, this doesn't mean that Amazon's 100 million-plus Prime members can start paying for their books and electronics with Bitcoin... yet.

But it does reveal Amazon foresees a day when its customers will use Bitcoin and other cryptos to make fast, cheap, secure payments",4

If you would like to take part and help me it'd be greatly appreciated, mainly because I feel like to many of you this is pure second nature and most sources I find are extremely repetetive/too technical/biased or building on hype/too advanced English as a non-native speaker. 

Mainly looking to get a general understanding rather than perfect technical knowledge etc, one or two simple sentences even if it doesn't accurately portray it would be awesome.

Regarding mining:

* Is the reward strictly dependant on how many hashes you try to break? Let's say 5 identical mining at same performance doing 1 trillion attempts per hour. Is there any form of luck/chance factor? Could a block be opened in 1min or 25min instead of the average 9-11?

* Are the people offering higher fee's to get their transactions made faster automatically picked up by miners or intentionally chosen or by chance? Does the paid fee get evenly distributed?

* Is the maximum transactions limit currently 7 per second?

Halving of coins:

* When the amount of coins is halved in 2020 odds are quite a few miners will stop mining as their revenue is cut in half, would that make the 'bitcoin network' less secure or slow down transactions?

Economical/Technical:

* Doesn't increasing the amount of coins daily have an impact on price of bitcoin?

* Isn't the current rather big fee's and wait times for transactions a noteworthy problem? Is it about prioritizing safety?

* Is it necessary to wait for your transaction to go through 6 blocks? Are there security risks only going through 2?

Other:

* Since the entire blockchain is stored and saved, is it possible to easily go through,find all of Satashi Nakamoto's transactions?

* Is Bitcoin Core or other Full nodes necessary to keep the network functioning? Is Bitcoin Core outdated compared to other alternatives? From what I have read the 200gigs, memory usage etc. Are there risks to having too few full node miners? And do full node miners get any more incentives to use full nodes?

* Does any problems come with GPU's being overtaken by ASIC's, much less nodes, profit much more limited to China/India/Iceland ETC

* What has been the key things in the new patches/releases of the mining protocol since its release?

For other's searching Googling etc few words that can be summarized in less than 2 sentences?

Hash, Nodes, Fork (soft/hard), Market cap

272,"Hello

Several small businesses I frequent only accept payment in cash or cheque because of high transaction fees on credit cards and other forms of payment.  The businesses are totally above board, they charge tax, give receipts etc.  So they aren't cash-only so that they can high income from the government.

This is super annoying to me, because it means I have to withdraw cash from an ATM before I can pay them.  The businesses are rural, so the closest bank/ATM is 10 minutes away.  This means I have to plan on going to the bank before I go to their business.

So as a thought experiment, how could I suggest to them that they start accepting payment in bitcoin via lightning network (raw bitcoin itself would be not acceptable because of transaction fees and because of the 10 minute wait).

What kind of electronics could they set up beside their cash registers to accept payments, and how can they """"plug themselves in"""" to the lightning network?  How can they exchange their payment in bitcoin to local currency with minimum effort in order to pay their employees?",2
273,"IMHO When people talk of bitcoin, they are using the wrong denomination.

Bitcoins should be thought of as the gold bars (1000g of gold) of crypto currency.  The middle class could/should never own a gold bar, as there are better ways to store wealth (land, stock, etc).

Similarly mBTC's analog would be an ounce of gold.

When thinking about Bitcoin as a currency, bits and satoshi's are the denominations that middle class people will use.

Now, let me hit you with some napkin math on why precisely bits and satoshi's will be what people speak in if/when BTC hits mainstream.

The GDP per capital over the entire world is roughly valued at [$8000USD/year](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/MateNagy.shtml).  This includes the richest of the rich, and poorest of the poor.  By 2030 the worlds population will be 8.5billion people.  Thus we can napkin math and say that the GDP of the world in 2030 might be close to 70trillion dollars. *note: obviously the networth of the entire world is much higher than this, but lets go with GDP per-capita for our maths here*

If Bitcoin becomes the dominant unit of trade by 2030, this means that the 21Million bitcoin will cover the value of that 70trillion USD GDP.  Meaning that a bitcoin would be worth around $3.2M USD.

Obviously, such exchanges are going to be extraordinarily rare.  But what about satoshi's?  A bitcoin worth 3.2M would mean a satoshi is worth 3.2 cents, and thus a bit would be worth 3.2 dollars.

Now THOSE are nice units of value for common trade.  You'll basically be paying 50 satoshi for a candy bar, which isn't an alien value for people to understand.

Of course, it's a huge IF that bitcoin becomes the dominant unit of trade.  Bitcoins will be useless if Quantum computers can crack a private key; Governments will push HARD on cryptocurrency if their fiat (and thus control of the populace) is truly tested; and the current banking system could implement a more trustworthy and cheap method of conducting business **in the eyes of the general population** *(note: I am specifically saying that the banks might trick the normies into believing in a new form of credit card is more trustworthy)*.  I haven't added any of that into my napkin math.",4

so I started my day off deciding I was going to try to use a bitcoin atm...

I found one, arrived at a coinsourse atm....

first off, there is no instructions on how to use it, or video tutorial at the atm...

secondly it asks for your phone number...

I entered it, then it sends you a confirmation code via text..

I entered the code...

then it says you must set up an account first...

go to their home page to do so on my phone...

they want your name, first and last, phone number....

then they want you to scan your id, front and back, and then take a selfie...

after you scan your id, and send in your selfie, it is supposed to set up an account...

there is no phone number to call for help... only a text number, and an email...

I sent a text at 10:56 am... inquiring about their registration requirements.... I still have not received a response it's now 4:32pm...

I sent them an email, and within a couple of minutes, about 5 mins, they respond.

so here is the frustrating part... 
I was in front of the atm for over two hours trying to meet there requirements to set up an account...

I sent pictures of my id front and back, all of them are clear, legible photos...

none of them were accepted. I kept getting texts saying your account has been set up for id verification...

during the sending pictures, i got logged off multiple times, and had to keep reentering the same info over, and over again... each time having to get a new text code...

in email communication, the person told me they could not scan my barcode on my id.. to keep re taking pictures, and resubmit till I got a verification text, or an accept text.

after five f@cking hours of trying to get my photos accepted, I gave up.

in email, they told me to keep trying, to use a scanner instead of my phone... I used my phone, I took pictures with my friends phone, and I even scanned my id.

I sent in all, of the pictures, over and over again... emailed back and forth multiple times...each time they tell me it's my fault...keep resubmitting till I got an acceptance text...

well I never got an acceptance text...

in email, they said that I should keep trying, thanks for my patience, and they would waive my first fees...when it is sucessfully set up.

I emailed them back and told them they get one star... and I will be giving a bad review on reddit.

this is why they suck!!!!

there is no phone number to talk to a human.

they never texted back.

when technology failed, they should have had someone manually set up an account and verify my id.

they also take 8% per transaction.

I strongly believe the world is entering into over-extension when it comes to debt and economic activity, for this cycle at least.

There are many reasons for this, but most importantly lower unemployment rate, and interests sharply increase! Every time interest rates has increased sharply markets (traditional markets) have tanked. 2001 and 2008 are good examples of this.

I am only writing this here because I believe that after a long while thinking, the best position to enter into when this cycle ends, is LONG Bitcoin. I do no longer believe that gold will be the best safe haven asset.

Therefore I urge all members of our community to handle their debt levels right now, so you don't have to dip into your holdings to alleviate the pain when interest rates go up 3-4%-points.

As for myself I will pull around 80% of the money I got in the stock markets the next couple months. And then watch Bitcoin closely awaiting entry. But who am I? You probably shouldn't take your advice from a 21 year old soon to be Econ undergraduate. So do your own research!

3. I don't care if BCH has the perfect roadmap, the best tech, the best community, and the most adoption. What is the ticker? Is it BTC? Then it isn't Bitcoin. There is one Bitcoin and it is BTC.  
 
It isn't about distribution, adoption, technology, use in the real world. None of that matters. This is about value, we have the BTC and no one else does and if they want it then they are going to have to pay for it. Big time.

However, as new class of digital assets continues to grow in popularity with investors around the world, this situation is about to change.

That was inadvertently confirmed by the Banco De Cabo Verde in one of its official """"comunicados"""", signed at 29 March 2018 and named """"Alerta Criptomoedas"""". This omnipotent one-pager presents itself the usual and all-so-familiar aggregation of anti-Bitcoin invectives. Various phraseologisms like """"transactions with virtual currencies pose a high risk"""", """"offer no protection to consumers"""" and """"its association with illicit schemes"""" are spilled all over it. Notwithstanding, this """"Alerta"""" might be as well viewed from an entirely different stand point.

Besides reminding residual investors about the existence of absolutely new, but not yet locally legalized assets class, the Banco's memo also demonstrates that crypto-phenomena has proved itself to be so omnipresent, that it has became nearly impossible to ignore it even for the absent-minded watchdogs living in the most geographically as well as financially remote parts of the world. With that said, however, we must add, that it might, still, be much more preferable for the local crypto-community (if such has ever existed) to stay hidden from the increasingly perceptive radars of the Cape regulators, which previously have never been noticed for a liberality of their views on the financial markets.

334,"All forms of money need to be easily broken down into identical sub units.

To the average person who stumbled across Bitcoin in 2017, the idea of a """"Bitcoin"""" didn't make sense. How can I use a currency so expensive that I can't even own """"one""""? Why should I buy .01 of a $10,000 Bitcoin?

Most of us understand that Bitcoin can actually be divided into 100,000,000 Satoshi's, making Bitcoin one of the most divisible currencies in the world, while retaining its perfect scarcity. However, most people are just now learning that **YOU CAN BUY A FRACTION OF A BITCOIN**.

But even when they understand that, many people still perceive the price of a single """"Bitcoin"""" to be super expensive, as if they missed their chance to buy Bitcoin on the """"ground level"""".

When the masses started coming during late 2017, the price of any coin under $1 exploded to the moon, all because people thought they missed out on Bitcoin and wanted the """"next big thing"""" \- expecting these coins to potentially reach $10,000 as well.

# Bitcoin -&gt; Bits

Breaking Bitcoin down into Bits is ultimately something we will need to do if we want the world to utilize Bitcoin as a usable \(linguistically\) currency. It makes more sense to buy a beer for 500 bits \($5\), rather than .00005 Bitcoin.

Similar to a stock split, this will give people the confidence to go buy 100 bits, and it will make them feel richer. Nobody likes to say, """"I own a small fraction of a Bitcoin."""" They like to say I own 500 \[insert coin here\], or 100 Bits.

A move from Bitcoin to Bits will spark another retail investor rally, and make Bitcoin a more """"speakable"""" currency.

# My Plan to Break Bitcoin into """"Bits""""

I run a web app: [MoonRekt.com](https://moonrekt.com/) \- a top 100 list/portfolio tracker. Now before you downvote me for shilling my own project \(I'm just a college student contributing to the community\), let me tell you it's 100&amp;#37; free, and I'm using it as a platform to spark the break Bitcoin into """"Bits"""" movement. From now on, Moon Rekt will only quote Bitcoin in """"Bits"""", and I encourage anyone running other Bitcoin apps/wallets/exchanges to do the same.

**Current Bitcoin Price: $0.0093** \- slightly less than one cent.

We should all start using Platforms that use Bits and also begin speaking in terms of """"Bits"""". We need crypto Twitter to get in on this. We need other websites and apps to get on this. We need exchanges to get on this. And we need CNBC to get on this.

The Bitcoin community is what controls Bitcoin, and if we all decide to start pricing Bitcoin in Bits, then the world will listen. Let's put an end to other worthless coins.

Let's start a rally in Bitcoin that will change the way the world views money.

In a recent interview with CNBC Mr. Buffet admits he regretted not believing in Amazon years ago, going as far as saying he was too dumb to realise it’s potential. 
Same approach for companies like Google, Xerox, Apple etc..., he didn't want to invest in something he didn't understand. These young talented freshmen had a clear vision but had to fight and persevere as they received little or no institutional fundings, often developing their ideas in their moms' garage. The support initially came from daring entrepreneurs that believed in the potential, even when nothing was proven yet. Countless college graduates indeed jumped on the boat and got very wealthy developing their business around those new technologies, I doubt many elderly people gave it a toss.

With all respect for his successful career and the great insights he had in his era, one could ask if he can still catch up the way society evolves around him. What were his thoughts when social media came up for example? Or imagine telling your grandpa his transistor radio would soon be replaced by a wireless device that plays any music where and whenever he wants 15 years ago.
It’s dissapointing that a man who used to have such great insights is arguing against something that totally surpasses his understanding, with examples of buying a farm. 
I understand people of his age find it difficult to even send a picture but the millennial generation will be perfectly able to integrate digital currencies into their everyday lives and get rid of those annoying pieces of paper and metal coins. Then there's decentralized internet, even those who do believe in it probably cannot imagine the potential yet, but that's another topic.

Oh and the intrinsic value gibberish... Consider other things people invest in like let's say paintings: if they’re into it and have the money, sure, enjoy it, hang it in your mansion or lend it to museums and have everyone applaud you for it, but how many pieces are just bought for exuberant amounts by some Saudi Arabian prince who barely looks at it and locks it in a vault? 
What’s the use of that other than hoping someone else will buy it for more like our friend the oracle says about cryptocurrency, no difference, it’s what you do with it.

Once this mindset hit, it did not take long for the entire world's financial system to change overnight.  Fiat plunged, bitcoin mooned.  Everybody learned the value of saving.  Everybody learned the value of each second in life.  Every word they uttered, every movement they made.  Nothing was taken for granted.

I know everyone loves to hate Coinbase, and I think this is another reason ... I noticed that when you BUY on Coinbase, not only is the BUY price higher than what is live on GDAX (their back end trading exchange), but they also charge a fee on TOP of that higher price.

However, if you SELL on Coinbase, at the same moment, the SELL price is LESS, and they still charge a fee.

For example, I noticed right now when the price on GDAX is $9250, a BUY BITCOIN price is 9296.  At the SAME time, if I SELL Bitcoin, the SELL price is $9203.  LESS than the BUY price, but also LESS than GDAX.  On both transactions, the Coinbase FEE is about $140.

It's not a lot, but in a given day, it adds up to a LOT of extra for them...this seems like a really big deal.

Has anyone ever noticed?",2

382,"Goldman's announcement that they will be introducing NDFs (Non-deliverable Forwards) for Bitcoin is a really big deal. This type of contract is how major emerging markets currencies are traded by banks and large institutional clients - no underlying currency is ever exchanged, the parties just settle up at the end of the contract in USD based on the price change. This is a big step in the legitimization of bitcoin as a real global currency, and allows for much easier hedging activity for players who want to get involved in the space.
Crucially, this is gigantic for Bitcoin as an actual use case currency, it allows major retailers who want to accept Bitcoin as a payment method to effectively hedge this exposure without all the hassle of physically transferring the Bitcoin as it is received. For example, Amazon could now manage Bitcoin transaction exposure the same way they would Indian Rupees. While businesses could hypothetically accept and manage the risk before, this opens up the possibility of them managing it in the exact same way they do their other EM ccy exposures, which is so much easier from an organizational perspective that is really changes the game.",4

It is not for myself that I had to take the chance of writing this up and make this appeal to the Bitcoin Community for an assistance.  As a head of a family and a suppose breadwinner for 3kids who all needed to go to school, I had to resort this time to this community and ask for support.  Luck has turned against me for 1year and half already that I have failed to land a job.  Have applied to lots of companies but seems someone who is at his 50s are not the cream of the crop for many employers.  Until now I am continuing my search but nothing has come into a small possibility.  The situation has got serious already, no more money to spend and pay the home mortgage, utilities and even meals for the kids has started to affect them.  I figured out that some community members here have a big heart at least to donate some Bitcoin that I can extend for the needs of the kids and partly pay the mortgage so I can focus and continue my job search.  Anybody who wish to help can send the BTC to this address:

It claims to be concerned citizen focused on the good of humanity. It wants to even the playing field between the people and the governments of the world by creating a decentralized currency. This currency is given the name.. Bitcoin. The world believes this entity to be a person or persons who are simply trying to protect their anonymity. Satoshi says that in order for Bitcoin to be truly decentralized, an incentive system based on a computational arms race must be put into place so that there will never be a single individual in control of the system. The arms race begins. First CPUs, then GPUs, then custom ASICs are made to snatch up the ever more valuable cryptocurrency. A multitude of cryptocurrencies are born, and with them, new highly advanced computation chips to provide the massive amounts of Proof of Work necessary to sustain the networks. At the same time, man-kind is also on the verge of a revolution in machine learning, and as a result of the huge production capacities that the silicon fabs have upgraded to, they find themselves with the ability to birth ever more powerful and complex chips that they can program to assist humans in their daily lives.

457,"So I got high the other night and rather than being able to sleep I gots to thinking... as mentioned in the tittle its a thought experiment so rather than keeping it all bottled up I thought I would have a thought dump on this subreddit... here goes...

If one of Bitcoins super rich was to try get Venezuela's economy up and running on Bitcoin what would be required, I know there would be loads of technical issues to address but bare with me on this thought train?

I first started to think what is the correct amount of Bitcoin to distribute to the people of Venezuela, this lead me to think about GDP, what is the GDP of the country? $314.1 billion https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/country-data/venezuela-gdp-country-report

What is the GWP? $107 trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product)

What is the country's GDP in relation to the GWP? .28%.

Then I thought what is that amount of the current supply of Bitcoin, 17 million. 

.28% of 17 million, is 47,600 that's a lot of Bitcoin... It amounts to at its current value approx $9000... $428 million.

I checked out what was the largest amounts held in Bitcoin wallets at this address https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html

So if a super rich Bitsy holder was to distribute that amount to the people of Venezuela what would be the consequences? 

I thought that Bitcoin could be distributed to the people through registering at an exchange with proof of address, obviously an address in Venezuela and ID, preferably a Venezuelan passport.

I'm not sure how it would work but it was an interesting thought experiment, to me at least. 

Its estimated that approximately 32,317,075 million people live in the country that would mean everyone would get approximately .00147290 which at its current rate is about $13-14. Maybe extra if you set up a node?

Obviously it could only happen through the generosity of our Lord and Savior Satoshi, maybe it could be on his list of things to do during the seconding coming?

Well thats enough written diarrhea for today. Good night and Satoshi bless.

The teller was a typical white, close to middle aged woman with blonde hair (later we found out her name is Ashley). She was the least bit friendly, and spoke down to us as we were trying to get information. 

All we needed was to speak with the manager who was in charge of setting up business accounts, as it was not even her job to drill us on our company. But instead of doing her actual job, she decided to take it into her own hands because she didn’t even take us serious as potential clients. Then before we even mentioned the words crypto currencies, she treated us as though we looked too rundown to own a business. Sorry that I am not dressed up, we didn't know that customers were going to be treated differently by their look. After we informed her that we registered our company, she was like what kind of company. We told her that we own a company that works with crypto currencies. 

She then told us that Banner Bank does not work with people that do crypto currencies, they ban/freeze their accounts. When we asked her why, she said because it is a fraud. But this is legally accepted, there is no laws against crypto, in fact we pay a huge amount of taxes because we feel that we should follow the laws.

479,"DO NOT PUT YOUR MONEY IN FREEWALLET. ALL OF MY FUNDS AND MY ID HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

First, please do not post comments that I should not have used Freewallet. I think that's pretty obvious now. It was a huge mistake but that doesn't make what they're doing any less criminal.

I suffer from cancer, which Ive told them already, but the Freewallet scam keeps on rolling. NO honest company has the HUNDREDS of scam complaints that these thieves at [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) do. Look up their previous posts to me.

For no valid reason, Freewallet began blocking customer access to their funds recently. Every ridiculous, phony excuse has been made, none of them true.

After absolutely assuring I would have access to my crypto after a simple ID submission, Freewallet instead obstructed my access by making an absurd claim that my ID photos had been edited. That is exactly the tactic I expected from this criminal organization. As I proved to them via video, all of my photos were 100&amp;#37; legitimate, completely unedited. On top of that, EVERY other crypto exchange that Ive submitted my ID to has NEVER even questioned it. WHY? Because the other exchanges are not scams like [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) is. Again, just look at the massive number of complaints. Search them. It speaks for itself.

Their tactic is beyond predictable for a scam. When they see they've encountered their worst nightmare, meaning me in this case, they begin resolving a few complaints here and there to make it look like they're trying to do right. All of those, however, are peanuts compared to my life savings. They would rather risk their necks than let that go back to its rightful owner. That's what lowlife scammers like Freewallet do.

Theyre so careless at Freewallet, that they never thought to consider Reddit posts CANNOT be deleted. This is NOT Facebook, where they delete customer complaints ALL the time.

Nothing matters to them but stealing my life savings. I have my life savings in there. I have given them EXACTLY what they asked for, and I still have NO access to my crypto.

My emails to them are now also with the US Attorney, who is the most prolific cyber crimes prosecutor on earth. They have already stated to my personal lawyer that a company who refuses to provide their own identities and location cannot lawfully ask customers for theirs. The USA's office labeled Freewallet """"an obvious scam"""" in a call with my lawyer. Im a US customer, so Freewallet must abide by US law. The US has extradited many cyber criminals who have never even set foot in the US before, just because they stole from a US customer. They have that kind of extreme influence worldwide.

At this point my cancer symptoms have grown worse due to the stress Freewallet has caused me. I can barely breathe at times. However, I certainly expect to be here long enough to have them prosecuted, via the US Attorney, and their partner, Interpol.

Perhaps their biggest problem though, is I now know who their biggest figure is, whose operation is funded by stolen Freewallet funds like mine, and until my crypto is released to me, he can expect his life to be a nightmare.

You stole from the wrong cancer patient Freewallet... and now you're going to pay",3

481,"We've seen the real-world use cases for ASICs many times, perhaps most notably in network switches. As switches evolved to do more intelligent processing, general purpose CPUs were not able to meet speed and energy efficiency requirements and thus, the eventual implementation of ASICs became the logical choice, as they were able to make switching decisions very quickly and much more efficiently. Over time, software-based processing via general purpose CPUs has no doubt increased greatly in both speed and efficiency, but even today, ASICs are still the logical choice when maximizing processing speed and energy efficiency.


With this in mind, I can't help but question why people are still so adamant about ASIC resistance.


I don't know if there are any algorithms in use today that are truly ASIC resistant, and even if there are, I don't think ASIC resistance is valuable property for a cryptocurrency on the layer one protocol level. The algorithms I've come across rely on complexity in order to discourage ASIC development, which in turn actually threatens decentralization since, if some entity were to eventually create an ASIC for one of these complex algorithms, no doubt other entities would have to undergo the burden of inventing an ASIC of their own. After all, we shouldn't assume that entities will freely share design blueprints. Thus, it would be an endeavour which would appear to be quite discouraging, as greater complexity would most likely translate into greater start up costs, and the fact that there would already be an ASIC manufacturer with an essential monopoly in the space would mean that new manufacturers would have to produce a product that is either adequately cheaper in price for the  consumer, or adequately more energy efficient, all while still maintaining desirable margins in order to stay afloat financially.


Of course, knowledgeable development teams would be aware of these concerns, and  would design software to allow for easy forking to different algorithms, should an ASIC ever be developed for the algorithm they were currently using. However, this not only highlights the issue of using algorithms which have never been tested outside of simulations (when applicable), but it also places the burden of consensus on the community. As we've seen, achieving consensus within a large community is not always a quick and easy process, even when the proposed changes are beneficial to the community at large. One could argue that part of the problem is that each consensus process is an opportunity for malicious actors (perhaps community members from a competing cryptocurrency) to cast their vote as well.


Details can be mulled over, but fundamentally, I believe ASIC resistance allows for more problems than ASIC acceptance.


On the other hand, algorithms that can easily be adopted for use with dedicated hardware allow for entities to manufacture ASICs with much lower start up costs in comparison to complex algorithms. As noted in the first paragraph, theoretically, ASICs allow for great processing power with less energy expense in comparison to general purpose CPUs of equal processing power. The reason that I use the word """"theoretically"""" here is because in reality, ASICs are not only much more energy efficient than general purpose CPUs, but also, ASICs deliver much greater processing power than general purpose CPUs. So, even if some magical general purpose CPU that could match an ASIC in processing power existed, that CPU would still be far less efficient than the real-world ASICs we have today.


In summary, I have yet to find any strong arguments as to why ASIC resistance should be a desirable property of a cryptocurrency on the level one protocol level.",2

493,"Hey everyone,

My name is Malcolm and I've been writing about Bitcoin and other various cryptocurrencies for some time now. I chose to host my content on Medium.com. Unfortunately, it seems like they are very hostile to crypto; indeed, crypto-related accounts on this platform have been vanishing left and right for totally frivolous reasons (hi, /u/Jarunik !). 

Well, it finally happened to me. They didn't give me any warning so I could move my work elsewhere or resolve whatever TOS issue they had with my content. They didn't even bother to let me know that I had been """"suspended"""" - or really, blacklisted/deleted. Indeed, as long as I was logged into my account it looked like my articles were still online! On top of this, once I figured out what was going on, they wouldn't even tell me what rule they thought I violated. Crazy, right?

Well, my understanding is that the community likes to keep abreast of banks, companies, platforms, and so on that are hostile to cryptocurrency. My opinion is that Medium is one of these companies. Thankfully, I am a computer scientist, so I was able to quickly spool up my own site. This is the first article I've written since the changeover, and I hope you find it interesting.

513,"Last Friday, I made a purchase from my bank account for a measly 200 bucks. The fees for buying directly from my checking account have always been much lower than using debit or credit cards, not to mention all of my cc's have banned the platform anyway. They applied the BTC to my account, but for the first time, I couldn't do anything with it outside of the Coinbase platform \(that includes moving it to GDAX\). The CB platform charges fees for every single transaction \(buy or sell\), in addition to boosting the price on all coins for purchases and then selling them back below market value as well \(this has got to the definition of economical double penetration, lol\). Today is Tuesday, and my 200 in BTC is still being held. So, I called their customer service.

To their credit, I was on hold for less than 3 minutes, and here is a paraphrase of the convo:

Me: I've made a deposit and I can't access it. I've made hundreds of deposits from this account in the past and its always been immediate access. I've never experienced this, can you please check it out?

CB: We recently updated our platform and you signed up to receive the update.

Me: No I didn't. I signed on to a pop\-up message that said my limits have been increased, but I never asked for or accepted any account upgrade; nor did I ask for my limits to be increased. You did that on your own. Can I go back to the old platform?

CB: No you can't. This is how the platform will operate for customers going forward.

Me: Look, the reason I made this purchase was to transfer those funds and purchase altcoins. The market is extremely volatile right now, and I want to diversify my portfolio. By the time you release the funds, the market could have rebounded and I lose a great opportunity.

CB: In regards to your deposit, you have to wait the until the deposit clears.

Me: It has cleared, and the funds were taken out of my account. I can prove it momentarily if you like.

CB: It has to clear our bank, not yours.

Me: I dont even know what that means. Your issue would seem to be crediting a buyer who turns out to have insufficient funds, which has never been my case.

CB: I'm sorry, we are not able to manually release funds.

Me: Are you going to give me interest for holding my $ without giving me access to it?

CB: No, once it clears, you will have access to it.

Me: My debit card from this bank does not allow me to purchase from you, but if I were to have used my debit card and subject myself to your insane fees \(the fees for using a card are wayyy more than for bank accounts\) would that have been instant access?

CB: Yes.

Me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5GS0MS5gU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5GS0MS5gU)

I've had a verified CB account \(from which I've made weekly deposits\) for a few years now; never had a real issue. I was always able to do whatever I wanted immediately as long as it wasn't a fiat deposit to the USD wallet. To add insult to injury, lol, I was an avid supporter of CB as I felt they have a rare and special opportunity to facilitate access while educating Main St. in regards to Bitcoin and crypto. Now, if I want to do anything with my coins, they are forcefking me to deposit via debit or credit card which incurs the highest fees their platform offers. 5 days after the purchase, I am still unable to trade, send, or even access the funds \(meaning I can't withdraw them\). Finally, I am able to see the true colors of Coinbase.

You are a greedy cck\-sucker Coinbase. I get that you're a business, and as an American, I respect that and your need to make a profit. However, your new terms of service resembles that of developing countries dictatorship. You tie people down and force them to operate within the avenues of your site that incurs insane fees! You are purposefully trapping people within your platform and forcing us to pay you if we want to do anything at all with our money. Isn't cryptocurrency supposed to allow me control of my money? Is my freedom to do what I want with my funds without anyone telling me how or when to do it not a backbone part of what decentralized currency is supposed to be all about?

In essence, you are going against the very bedrock foundation of what the asset that made you rich stands for, you greedy smug mf'er. I will not use my debit cards \(even if I could\), I refuse to let you force me to pay your insane fees, and you can suck my ballz. Sooner or later, someone will come thru and wrek your business model. Until then, you can suck on BBC. \(\&lt;\-\-\-\-\- not a coin\).",3

519,"So, I've been dicking around today, playing games, drinking, etc. The kind of shit you do when you're just off in your own space and I had a couple of ideas that I thought were pretty decent. I'm eagerly looking forward to having them destroyed. I think I've got it, though. Really.

In short, its a credit agency almost completely decoupled from an individuals identity, that relies on a historical blockchain transaction data and modern analytics to determine if an individual is a good risk or not.

Now I realize this sounds simple, but it seems like such an obvious place for bitcoin to start. I don't have details worked out since this is a day dream, more or less, and its also not my field even remotely, but the question I was asking when I came up with this notion is """"what can bitcoin do that legacy banking systems cannot?"""".

The answers I came up with were 

1. An open source, secure, unforgeable, database of historical *transactions*.

2. An insanely fast settlement layer. Between LN and the blockchain its just no contest anymore. This is where I want some parsing. Without talking about TPS, which is a tech problem that is being solved, please explain to me why the ad hoc system like Visa (or MC, AE, Discover, etc) +  whatever your random banks loan officer is superior to the publicly available and instantly verifiable data that could be gleaned from whatever blockchain you happen to use?

3. There just isn't as much of a need for personal information. Credit agencies are a MASSIVE weak point in our financial system as Equifax so cleanly demonstrated to us. Having a third party centralizing personal identifying data that could be used for identity theft is a tremendous risk. If you're an American, its safe to assume at this point that your personal identifying data, all of which can be used to completely demolish your ability to obtain lines of credit or finance major life events, is pretty much publicly available. Rather than having control of your *own data*, under the legacy system you've ceded control of it, like in the case of equifax, to a music major who cares so much about your identity that literally all of your personal data was exposed to internet protected by the password """"admin"""". If you think this level of opsec and care is an outlier, I've got a bridge to sell you, payable in bitcoin. Super cheap, too. I'll underbid freaking anyone. Try me.

In any case, since loans are being distributed based on middling at best quality data, the massively superior quality of data that pretty much any publicly auditable blockchain is capable of delivering would make this service a no brainer. 

Think, a Cambridge Analytica who, instead of trying to subvert the political will of people internationally, was able to use the bitcoin blockchain coupled analytic techniques to provide sub prime loans for housing that were *actually safe bets and not likely to blow up the global financial system*. 

My wife and I recently bought our first house, and its insane to me how some of these businesses decide who to loan to. I mean, I had to provide paychecks and whatnot, but those are all forgeable documents, you know? Tax records, likewise, but how difficult would it be to set up a shell company for no other purpose but to pay taxes for no other reason but to acquire a significantly larger amount of money with no intent of paying it back? Personal data used to be the safeguard, but since its essentially public information at this point, how could you possibly make lending decisions like that knowing that who you're sitting in front of could be pretty much anyone? I'm sure there's insurance and governmental guarantees and whatnot, but all of that is, frankly, superfluous financial infrastructure if you could dial down those risks. 

Also: super short term loans.

For most people, the notion of grabbing a million+ dollar loan out of thin air is absurd. For banks, its equally absurd. There's so much due diligence required on the back end to determine an individuals credit worthiness that amounts to little more than digging through and aggregating historical financial data that lending to people who may not have the same kind of financial history as, say, the already wealthy that it rapidly becomes not worth the effort at all unless your bank account is sufficiently large and you have significant collateral to provide. Blockchains not only aggregate a lot of that data for you, but they provide previously impossible transaction/account scrutiny. Say, for instance, massive subset of people who payback their loans have a tendency to spend and receive cash in a very specific pattern, its entirely possible that in the future those data points become WAY more important for evaluating credit worthiness than something as rudimentary as a missed payment, you know?

I feel like missed payments and other significant factors in your credit worthiness are more of a best guess based on currently available information, but there's a real possibility that information contained in a massive open source database like bitcoin could prove to be a much more accurate smoking gun that could, at the end of the day, mitigate risks to the lender and create a situation where many, many more people have access to financial services because lenders have access to better, more granular financial data, and those lenders, as a result, make a LOT more money.

Our current legacy system has, as its backbone, a level of inscrutability. That inscrutability has provided some level of security by obscurity, but the world has changed dramatically in the past 20 plus years. Obscurity is rightly recognized as not security at all, but as onerous complexity. This recognizance, however, has not been shared by some financial businesses which rely on obscurity as security since changing the business model up costs money and why would they waste money?

There's a massive sucking sound, and that sound is obscurity being pulled out of the room by quality information, AI, and the ability of engineers to ask the right, most pertinent questions. Many of our most important institutions are run by older folks who often struggle to reckon with an update to their phone, let alone a technological revolution of their livelihood. 

This represents a business opportunity for those of us who are nimble. 

USAA has a very strong business model that, in part, relies, or relied initially anyhow, on the fact that military people and their families are cheaper to insure and bank for than others. Gmail pulled a similar thing when it came out, but failed in the same strategy with google plus. The reason it worked with USAA and Gmail and not with google plus, is because at the time those services were legit superior products. I had shitty ass hotmail at the time Gmail got rolled out, and back then there was no comparison. I can't really speak to USAA as much. I bank with them and they're pretty run of the mill, tbh, cheaper on some things, not so much on others, but the I kinda think USAA had its heyday a while ago. 

Likewise, gmail isn't a much better service than, say, outlook or yahoo or whatever.

But it was at one point.

We're at that point with bitcoin. Bitcoiner specific services will make this ecosystem explode. If you, as someone who owns bitcoin, can get a credit card for, say, half the APR of a non bitcoiner, you'd have people buying bitcoin like hotcakes and if there's one undeniable truth about bitcoin and other cryptos its that they are bull and bear amplifiers in an unprecedented way.

With participation limited to USA only at the moment it is hard to find much if any information on it in the UK apart from press releases which are scarce of details. It leaves me wondering what the differences will be between Sachs Usd Coin and it's already established competitor usd Tether? 

Given the bad press Tether has been receiving recently in regards to lack of audits and rumours that it's backing account does not reflect the amount of coins now in circulation a usd backed coin with a highly established, all be it morally questionable corporation, at the helm might just be what cryptos need right now. 

This is a bold statement as having a decentralised currency propped up by the reputation of a centralised corporation like Sachs seems to go completely against the crypto ethos but if it helps new investors that are hesitant to get involved and also helps people who are currently invested but finding it hard or don't know how to convert back to fiat, or have little faith in companies that already offer this service, to do so without worrying.

530,"I got into an argument with a co-worker over whether Ben Franklin deserves credit for defending the inalienable right to create our own currency. Ironically, Franklin is on the $100 bill but I don't think he'd want to be. 

In 1729, a 23-year-old Franklin wrote [A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/publications/economic-education/ben-franklin-and-paper-money-economy.pdf) In it, he argued for a new currency that brought economic stability to working classes and angered established elites. After the revolution, Franklin was instrumental in establishing a currency that helped pull people out of poverty, writing  """"Where there is a free government, and the people make their own laws by their representatives, I see no injustice in their obliging one another to take their own paper money."""" The Colonial Scrip, and Britain outlawing the colonial currency, eventually became major points on the road to Revolution.

As my co-worker points out, while Franklin was supportive of a national bank issuing notes backed by gold and silver reserves, he wasn't as outspoken against the idea of a national bank as Jefferson was: 

""""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.""""  - Thomas Jefferson  

We could not agree on whether Franklin or Jefferson deserved more credit for the original stance on defending the freedom to create currency. But since Franklin is more iconic we went with him for our design:

539,"Peercoin introduced the proof-of-stake model in order to solve the problems that Bitcoin faces for working over Proof-of-work. In this model, nodes votes are weighted on, depending on the implementation, the held amount or a bet/tip (stake) over the voted block. This way, those who hold higher amounts have a stronger voting power than those who don’t. Proof-of-Stake defenders admit it and say that hardly someone who owns a huge amount of a PoS-based currency could act in a way that could be negative for the currency’s blockchain, since this user would see his portfolio also losing value if the currency presented some flaws due to his behavior. If, however, a competitor does a calculated investment, buying lots of coins or even persuading several heavy-holders to act in ways that could break the network (i.e. voting in invalid blocks, DoSing etc.), would not it be able to break the currency ecosystem? Also, is PoS not dangerous for the currency democratic system, since if you do not hold a good amount, your voting power is almost nullable? How does PoS-based systems protect their democracy, network integrity and security?",3

Bitcoin is in danger of sliding towards $8,000 but is supported above $8,250 during the intraday session on Thursday. There is a classic falling wedge pattern forming on the charts where Bitcoin price is trading lower highs and almost ranging lows. The buyers are have put their best foot forward to prevent major declines, however, BTC/USD is down a subtle 0.40% in the last 24 hours at the time of press.

PayPal launched Bitcoin payments back in 2015, however the CFO at the online payment guru, John Rainey says that at the moment the same merchants are not interested in taking virtual currency payments. Mr Rainey, while on CNBC’s Mad Money segment narrated how PayPal was among the first to allow merchants to accept cryptos years back. However, Rainey says “right now, we don't see a lot of interest from our merchants."""" He added that this does not take away the support for Bitcoin:

""""But if it is something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that.""""

Bitcoin price is testing the prevailing resistance area at $8,300, although it is still in danger of sliding. The buyers are eyeing $8,500 (100 SMA), but in the meantime, $8,400 is enough. The 50 SMA will offer resistance as the price attempts to correct higher close to $8,350. On the downside, $8,250 is a short-term support zone, but further declines beyond this level will be halted at $8,200 and $8,100.

545,"Guys, this is HUGE! There was a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k0tch/bitcoin_booming/?st=jhb34fag&amp;sh=44e63c71) earlier here in r/bitcoin about [Climb real estate] (https://i.redd.it/4i3af9x6yby01.jpg) and there was a sign underneath it saying that they accept bitcoin. Now most of us might be like, oh yeah right, probably they are not serious, and to be honest this is what I thought too!

So I have decided to contact them via [chat](https://i.imgur.com/LlsVCO8.jpg), and right away they said that they will only accept US dollars. Was kinda disappointed at that point, but I thought it might be a robot who I was talking, so I decided to try via email. 

They have responded to my email pretty fast, and they confirmed that they indeed accept BTC for payment. 

I asked about the following:
-I’m curious of the procedure of a purchase in bitcoin. Could you please let me know in detail how it works?
-It’s very easy. I process up to $10M in Bitcoin into escrow account and close deals 7-10 days after.
The process is like this. You choose a house that you like and want. I process your Bitcoin through BitPay by invoice within 24 hrs. That money goes directly into escrow account and we close 7-10 days after. And after that you are the owner of a beautiful home

Now some of you may think that this is not that big of a news, but let me tell you that it defiantly is a big news. 

A real estate agent accepting a cryptocurrency is the **best thing** that can ever happen to crypto. 

Lets hope that this is one out of many that will (hopefully) follow. 

I'm currently not in a position to look for a house/property, but I know, that within the next few years, I will be, and my goal is to be able to buy my first house fully out of crypto.

This means:

**1)** Either they use a single payment address and everyone can see exactly how much they are making, and where they are spending it, or

**2)** They use multiple addresses, to increase anonymity. This means the IRS has no way of guaranteeing how much the business has made, since a dishonest business may decide not to disclose all the addresses used to the IRS. 

Are there any solutions to this problem yet?

I have been thinking of a solution that resembles *stealth addresses*, with a little twist: 

**a)** A single """"""""stealth address"""""""" is generated by the business. This address is generated using one (or more) public key(s) from the business and a public key from the IRS. 

**b)** Each sender could verify that the payment was sent, but could not see the total amount sent to that address.

**c)** The twist is that the address was generated in a way that allowed the holder of a specific private key (the IRS, in this case) to see the amount sent to that business' address, but not to move the coins. The coins can only be moved by the business (that holds the necessary private keys).

(Of course payments could be made to another address, but that would require cooperation from the sender. Using the public key provided by the IRS, any user would be able to see if an address is/isn't linked to the IRS).

Transactions from that address would require 2-of-3 private keys (in the case where it's created using 2 keys from the business and one from the IRS). This means the IRS could not move the coins, but the business could move them at their will.

This would be heaven for the IRS, since all the monitoring is very easy to do.

Im sure this is big business for inventory software companies.

If there was such a thing as a global ledger that allowed POS terminals to tx updates upon each purchase, the system could manage itself allowing for manufacturers to automatically ship items to distributors based on products going beneath supply threshold levels, and would allow for the above customer service scenario in which a manufacturer can easily tell customers where items are in stock.",3

39,"I am not a big fan of social messaging but I acknowledge that apps like Whatsapp and Viber are hugely successfully today because people like to communicate with each other through their personal mobile device.

People are familiar with social messaging apps but not Bitcoin apps like Blockchain.info wallet or Hive wallet. If only people are able to send money through social messaging apps, we could see a massive explosion in Bitcoin usage. I am using the specific term Bitcoin here and not the general cryptocurrency because (1) Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency today and (2) There is no need to reinvent the wheel by creating a new social messaging app specific cryptocurrency.

Which brings me next to Gems. Gems is a great idea because it combines social messaging with cryptocurrency. But by introducing the cryptocurrency Gems, it creates an additional layer of unnecessary complexity. Why not just use Bitcoin?

At the end of the day, what will really take off is to be able to send text messages as well as money over a single social platform. I see that either existing social applications will integrate Bitcoin into their system in the near future or Bitcoin wallet apps like Blockchain.info will add new chatting feature or a new class of text and money sending app will emerge. I see this happening within the next year.

Exciting times ahead because of Bitcoin. ",5
40,"Giving folks bitcoin (*e.g.*, paper wallets) as gifts has two major downside risks:
* That they not understand bitcoin and thus don't appreciate the gift, and
* That the value of the bitcoin go down significantly and they come to rue the day they received your gift.

Here's a time-proven way to overcome those problems: **Guarantee the value of the bitcoin gift for one year.**  Give it with this caveat/promise, either written or verbal: """"""""The price of bitcoin rises and falls sometimes dramatically. For that reason, I guarantee the value of this gift for one year.  If during that year the price goes down and you want to redeem the gift, I will buy it back from you for the exact dollar amount I paid for it. If the value goes up and you wish to keep the gift, all profits are yours to keep.""""""""

-----

A few years ago I was depressed, anxious and borderline paranoid. A heavy interest in politics and economics combined with a public education will do that to people these days. All through the public education machine I wondered... *Why are they doing things this way?* I mean it is the 21st century and we live in the richest country in the world. Your telling me that the school ran out of paper? *Seriously, you can't budget enough for paper?* Politics I don't even need to elaborate on. C-Span is as about as ridiculous as the comedy channel these days but its not funny because those people control our lives. 

Then along comes a Bitcoin. At first, like many of you I didn't give it the time of day. Then during my search for the causes of evil and the desire to find a form of money that isn't under the influence of bureaucracy or politics I stumble across Bitcoin again. I was really impressed, and amazed and thought it was too good to be true. I spent weeks locked in my room living off takeout and the mini-fridge trying to find the catch-22. Once I surfaced again I began to change. 

I admit it took a awhile to get balanced again but slowly over the last year I have settled down. My anxiety about the state of the world and the direction it is going in dissipated. I no longer feared the ignorance in the world and the crazy people in charge. I had a digital, stateless, borderless, indestructible, censorship-free form of trade, communication and money. At first it was the ultimate weapon in my mind. Visions of burning federal reserves and a crumbling capitol building filled my dreams. Its quite fun to be young and passionate about the world with a desire to change it. 

Over time the dreams have gotten more realistic. I realized that the old can not be destroyed without first having an alternative. This change would be rapid, but as our alternative grows the old system wanes. The fire engulfing the federal reserves became foreclosed signs. The crumbling capitol building became a museum and monument to the past. I understand that as much as I feel the primal urge to hang em all and let some invisible wizard sort the good from bad, we need to be better than them. We don't need to torture or kill our opponents, and especially not in some mob like fashion without a trial. Bitcoin threw back the curtain of our Wizard-of-Oz style oppressors. All we need to do to succeed is speak softly and offer the alternative. The way out of a system sustained with lies and corruption, the ultimate red pill.

If you truly believe in the core principles of Bitcoin then the free market must be pretty darn important to you. If you believe like I do that the free market is the most powerful than there will be no need for violence of any kind. Our product is vastly superior to anything else on the market today and it can adapt as fast as we need it to, so we will win. $1,000 per bitcoin was a valuation heard around the world. It was swiftly followed by the bursting of the parabolic bubble which has resulted in one of the longest if not to be the longest bear run in Bicoin's short history. Yet, I am not deterred. I have been inspired by what I have witnessed. 

I have watched as venture capitalists poor money into the system at a rate not seen sense the early days of the internet. Start-ups popped up faster than weeds in my yard. I participated in open beta's of new services that drew my attention and watched fondly as they grew in popularity. Two of my favorites are [LetsTalkBitcoin](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/) and [ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com/). I attended the first Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas and was pleasantly surprised to have my brain completely melted before the lunch break on the first day. 

People that are involved in this space are smart and I was definitely not even in the top 50% of most intelligent people in that room. I heard aerospace engineers asking questions to the panelists and listened to a Chinese exchange CEO explain that over 75% of the people registering for his exchange had engineering degrees. Those people really knew their stuff and they were all working in or wanting to get involved in Bitcoin. I was intimidated and as snobby as it may sound that doesn't happen often for me. 

This road of bits has not been without setbacks. I lost 15 bitcoins due to not making backup copies of a cold storage paper wallet. Needless to say the running joke among my friends from when I left $200 in a movie theater picked up new steam. My first project was a combination of proof of identity and counterparty to build a charity hub for completely transparent direct charities that could track your donation all the way to the actual items purchased. That project was a bit too ambitious for an amateur like myself but I see others have taken up that mantel in different ways that may be even be better than my approach. I then turned to entertainment where I wanted to bring something like the classic trading card games to the blockchain. I again started with the wrong approach and I stumbled upon this cool project [Deckbound](https://www.deckbound.com/) that is doing such a better job than I was that I scrapped my idea in favor of following that project. Sure things have not been smooth sailing for me so far, but I am not deterred.

Bitcoin is not just a superior product. It is one of only a handful of investments that I can also agree with morally. Putting money in a bank or brokerage went out the window after I studied the perpetual war machine and how it was funded and maintained. It basically boiled down to physical commodities and Bitcoin. Everything else was tainted with fiat coupons and they generally made me sick to look at. It was like I was living in the movie [*They Live*](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/2224633/they-live-subliminal-message-o.gif). I know it isn't very popular these days to invest based off of moral reasons, but I think maybe it would be a better place if more people did. 

The """"""""*real*"""""""" markets don't really inspire much confidence now a days. The conspiracy theorists were generally proved right, all the markets are rigged. As Rinehart Founder Andrew Cunagin puts it in the WSJ article [here:](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-blames-high-frequency-trading-for-shutdown-1409853730) 
""""""""This is a circus market rigged by HFT and other algorithmic traders who prey on the rational behavior of warm-blooded investors,"""""""" - Mr. Cunagin. [GATA](http://www.gata.org/) has been screaming about commodity rigging for decades now. So if you trust the same people that are pushing for your currency in the bank to be [labeled as paper investments rather than money](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2014/11/warning-bank-deposits-will-soon-no.html) so they can *bail-in* whenever they are in the mood.... well goodluck to you. I am not much of a doomsday prepper myself but things like the [Treasury Department Spending $200,000.00 on Survival Kit For Bank Employees](http://freebeacon.com/issues/treasury-department-seeking-survival-kits-for-bank-employees/) definitely gets my attention. 

To me Bitcoin is the least risky investment in the world right now. A bold statement, one that should attract some attention if trolls spend the time to read this extremely long post. Investing in Bitcoin by buying bitcoins is like owning a limited edition part of an industry index. This industry already contains the best form of money, the best money authentication system, the best money transfer service, the best money security and privacy options, all while being completely censorship-free, unexpected inflation-proof and immune from politics or bureaucracy. Oh it also is just about the only value transfer service that makes sense for micro-transactions and the internet of things/trade between machines. So even if we see *the big dip* right before the Bitcoin Bowl in the next few weeks, I will not be deterred.

It is time for me to embrace plan B. Yesterday I announced my intention to completely cut myself off from the fiat money system by January 1st, 2015. I will get paid in bitcoins, I will pay my bills in bitcoins. I will invest in bitcoins and I will secure my own Bitcoin investments. I will protect my monthly spending coins from volatility using a Bitcoin service and use a Bitcoin debit card everywhere bitcoins are not currently accepted. I am also working to establish some pure Bitcoin revenue streams next year. This is not my first leap of faith into the wonderful world of crypto-currencies. I am intentionally and with due diligence strapping myself to this moon rocket and daring the world to stop it. So please don't comment telling me how risky this is, I am well aware of the risks. This risk I take is mine and mine alone and the profit if it succeeds will be too. I have no dependents and I am still young. Win or lose it will be one hell of a ride.

Thank-you for reading and thank-you Satoshi.

Player a sends 0.01 bitcoin to BAg and player b sends 0.01 bitcoin to BAg.

65,"The limited supply of Bitcoins is seen as a good thing because it prevents inflation (or something).

But there is nothing stopping a country (the US, for example) from simply announcing that they will print no more money. So why don't they?

Some people want Bitcoin to be the only currency but it's built-in scarcity actually works against it in that sense. If you own 1% of all Bitcoins today (possible for early adopters who got in quick), you will still own 1% of all Bitcoins even if each Bitcoin is worth a million dollars and is the sole currency of the world. 

This actually creates a number of problems (like massive wealth inequality) but a very important one is money supply. If I hold onto that 1% of Bitcoin (or Satoshi's 5%), the global economy only has 99% of Bitcoin to play with. 

At the moment, you can't hoard USD because they can always print more. But you can (and people do) hoard Bitcoin. Why is this a good thing? How does Bitcoin deal with this issue?

66,"The current financial crisis started (actually: *became visible*) in late 2008 - coincidentally coinciding with the end of Bush's term.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail

*During 2008, the five largest U.S. investment banks either failed (Lehman Brothers), were bought out by other banks at fire-sale prices (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) or were at risk of failure and obtained depository banking charters to obtain additional Federal Reserve support (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). In addition, the government provided bailout funds via the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008.*

I have a theory that these crises nowadays tend to come every 8 years - when the current US president is on his way out (so he can let the next guy clean up the mess).

In other words: they no longer can fix the problems. So they just """"""""kick the can down the road"""""""" and let the poor sap on the next shift deal with it. 

Washington, issuer of the world's reserve currency the almighty military-backed petrodollar, quietly sweeps all the bad news under the rug for 8 years. 

Most US presidents get the maximum of two 4-year terms these days via reelection - so they end up serving a total 8 years.

Once those 8 years are over and the US President is getting ready to leave office - bam! that's when they let the shit hit the fan, since most of the current officeholders and employees (from the President and his appointees all the way down) won't have to be around anymore to clean up the mess.

As we all know, the financial news has been pretty grim on a regular basis these past few years. In particular: 

- They already blew their wad on QE1, QE2 and QE3 - so the next time the top """"""""too-big-to-fail"""""""" banks start to fail again... well we're already at ZIRP and some banks are even offering *negative* interest on savings accounts... so it's gonna be hard to do any more QE.

www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/negative-interest-rates

- There are now regulations in effect saying that the next time banks fail, there will be Cyprus-style """"""""bail-ins"""""""" a/k/a confiscation of *your* money - ie, as an account-holder, you will lose some of your money. (Technically, it's not even considered """"""""your money"""""""" anymore. Instead of a depositor, you're now like a bondholder in the bank - and a very, very junior bondholder at that. So get in line after the other, more senior creditors, Buddy!)

- Citigroup has been trying to sneak clauses into the current Federal budget to force the *taxpayers* to pay the *bankers* the next time the bankers lose while gambling at their global derivatives casino (currently over 1 *quadrillion* dollars, in nominal terms).

http://bitcoinclock.com/

So fasten your seatbelts and get ready to ride out the perfect financial storm in 2016 - and until then, HODL!!!

PS - I don't give a *fuck* about """"""""merchant acceptance"""""""" of bitcoin. And hipsters who get excited when they can buy a tall latte with their bitcoin on their iPhone at Starbucks - *please* y'all gotta grow up, children.

As far as I'm concerned, bitcoin is like gold - to be hoarded for several years. 

And do *you* practice KYC/AML when you sell your bitcoin on an exchange? That's right, I didn't think you did. For all you know, that could be Jamie Dimon buying up all your bitcoin - trying to corner the market. You know he has an infinite fiat printing press, so what's it to him if he has to drop a cool $5billion to buy up everyone's bitcoins?

I'd recommend localbitcoins - face to face. Just to make sure it isn't some shady Wall Street character buying up your bitcoins. You know they're probably totally two-faced. On YouTube telling you: worthless fantasy unicorn internet money blah blah blah and meanwhile they're probably scooping up all they can on the exchanges while coins are still cheap.

Meanwhile, I ain't gonna buy no xbox or overpriced coffee by shaving off a piece of a gold coin. That shit's for my retirement.

Or at least until after the end of 2016.

67,"I know it's common on the site to suggest that people NOT give bitcoin as a gift.

I think there is a way to do it, and in the right context it works well.

People typically give it and present it as money. It's silly. Why would you give people more or less a gift card that they have to sign up for things to use, and can only be used in a limited number of places? This is almost worse than just a 1-store gift card. Plus they have fees... have to learn all about it... etc.  It's like handing somebody $50 in Yen and saying Merry Christmas. It kinda sucks in this context.

However, present it in the context of a lottery ticket. It's an emerging technology thing that could take off, but might not be worth anything. Let them ask questions.

**On top of this, would you like to get one big lottery ticket as your gift this year?** No. That gift would probably suck. So don't do that. Get something else that's a real gift, and get a small amount in btc if you would like.

This way, you can explain what it is in a way that makes them want to hold, may pique their interest in learning more about it, and, most importantly *sets an expectation of loss*.

The Phillipines counts many overseas workers who remit money home to support their families. It's a huge market so I took the time to calculate the costs involved to transmit money home and my mind was blown by how cheap it is.

I made a screenshot of the info needed to calculate the fees to remit money to the Philippines.

http://imgur.com/aULG6Kf

Here is the calculation:

* The amount received is PHP 4,516.57
* The amount to be paid is 0.318473 BTC or 318 473 bits
* The current USD / PHP rate is 44.7255
* To buy 318 473 bits cost at that time was $314.32 x 0.318473 = $100,10 at Bitfinex
* Let's take into account a 0,30% fee at Bitfinex, so the cost is $100.1 x 1.003 = $100,40
* The amount of of PHP received is 4,471.57. Regarding the Yahoo Finance rate that is $4,471.57 / 44.7255 = $100,98
* **Total costs $100.40, total received $99.98!!!**

Important notes:

* These are the costs for sending money to a bank account. If you use a pickup service extra costs are involved, but are still much cheaper than the alternatives.
* For some transfers to a bank account there is an extra fee of $1, still much cheaper than the alternatives.
* The costs vary due to volatility but overall I've noticed the fees are between free and 1%.

97,"So I'm a pretty new adopter to bitcoin. Getting it is, as y'all know, one of the bigger hurdles. I heard about LiberyX but wasn't getting my hopes up due to the posts of it not working.

However, I went out to a place with a """"""""Trailblazer Promo"""""""" and recited the phrase from LibertyX's website, asking for a QPay PIN for LibertyX. The guy was a tiny bit confused at first, saying he should be able to do it but that he hadn't logged into QPay for a while. After a couple minutes, he had found it in their system. Unfortunately he informed me they didn't have any $50 PINs left, so I had to spring for a $100. (They come in 50/100/200/300). The guy was super nice, and printed out my receipt with the PIN no problem.

I got home, registered for LibertyX, and put in the PIN and wallet address I wanted it sent to. Within 5 minutes I had the bitcoins, pending confirmations from the blockchain. I emailed them about the Trailblazer promo, and they informed me that it was actually their fault the $50 PINs were out of stock, and promptly sent another $5 in BTC to the wallet I had used for the PIN in the first place.

100,"A new bitcoin node from Mike Hearn:

&gt; For those who didn't see it on the bitcoin-development list, I am now maintaining a patch set on top of Bitcoin Core.

&gt; It's called Bitcoin XT (for extras, extended, experimental, whatever) and currently adds two new features to the p2p protocol:

&gt;    getutxo, which is needed by Lighthouse and perhaps other apps that want to do a check on the validity of a tx without actually broadcasting it

&gt; Double spend relaying

&gt; The github link is here:

 &gt;   https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt

&gt; There are gitian-built code signed downloads for Linux, Mac and Windows (32/64 bit) so it should be easy to get started.

&gt; The point of this project is to provide a full node that has an explicit goal of supporting the needs of SPV app developers, as well as a place to try out more experimental changes in general. Through the course of 2013 I feel that the upstream Bitcoin Core project has become a relatively unpredictable place and I no longer feel sure that we can improve SPV mode or even that they will continue to support it at all. Bitcoin XT will always support SPV wallets.

&gt; I will rebase it from time to time. The current builds are based on Core 0.10 rc1 so they should download the block chain nice and fast, thanks to headers-first. If you run Core nodes, why not consider switching to XT! They use the same data directories so if you are already synced the switch is free.

&gt; If you do, please sign up for the announcement list:

&gt; https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-xt-announce

&gt; There's also a list for discussion of possible patches specifically:

&gt; https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-xt/

&gt; And finally, of course new features are no use if you can't find nodes implementing them! So I am now running a new crawler and DNS/HTTP seed here:

&gt; dnsseed.vinumeris.com
&gt; http://vinumeris.com:8081/peers.html    (drop the extension to get protobufs, or use .json/.xml)

Also these places will have chapters that can have a say within their concentrated hive brain as to solutions to bitcoin's upcoming problems.   Yes we have the antitrust algorithm for a reason, but I do feel that the mathematics can slowly influence the progression of how we approach these solution processes thought-wise (for example an observation of a 2014 blowout of businesses and ideas stressing open source-ness validity).
     What most people are overlooking is that(although I hate to admit a necessary evil) money is a big motivator to progress and now we also have technology to preserve faithfulness, trust and also an escape valve when things go sour.  All of these new approaches to the economy are phenomenal and now I feel that having some type of bitcoin chapters created around the globe can truly help people understand.  Online learning is great but to be honest....I learned about bitcoin when one of my friends sent me this magic internet money live..... phone to phone.

105,"Title says it all. I'm working on an online trading card game. It's pretty early in development, but very much playable. I'd like it /r/Bitcoin would give it a try, considering it only accepts Bitcoin at the moment (I'll be adding PayPal support, in the future). 

Link to the website, **[here](http://forgotten-lore.com/)**.
Direct link to download the game, **[here](http://forgotten-lore.com/game/ForgottenLore-update.zip)**. 

**the game**- Forgotten Lore is an online trading card game that you can play with both friends and strangers. It's got a dedicated server setup, so you can do random matchmaking, trade cards with other players, duel specific people, and earn in game money (or purchase it via bitcoin, if you wish). I'm obviously biased, but I'd say the game is pretty fun. I've caught myself playing it with a friend while I should be debugging. 

**some background**- I'm a CS student at Oklahoma State University. While I'm here, I've been programming little video games here and there, mostly cross platform with Android and PC. This card game is my most recent project, and will probably be the biggest while I'm in College. 

**Technical stuff**- I used Bitcoinj to implement the bitcoin transactions myself, I didn't rely on any other system. When a user registers an account in the game client; it sends a message to a program which generates a private/public key for that user, and generates a QR code for the public key. It then adds the keys to the main server wallet and awaits a transaction. When the player wants to buy some in game gold; they are prompted with a [QR code](http://forgotten-lore.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoin.png) (clicking on it copies the address to your clipboard). The program on the server will listen in, and if a transaction is made on that address, the amount is converted over to in game currency, and the transaction is complete. Later (after confirmations), the bitcoin is forwarded to an offline wallet.

118,"Hi!
I happen to be UX person and also a newbie fan of Bitcoin.

Beside the fact that it can be a revolutionary technology, in my opinion it is also very user-un-friendly in some aspects. One of them are **bitcoin addresses**. They're (by most people) **impossible to remember and to compare**.

QR codes made it easy for mobile devices to copy the exact addresses. Nevertheless, in case of pasting them  (or worse - typing them manually!) on desktops - it is quite uncomfortable, and can sometimes give this unpleasant feeling of uncertainty whether they have been entered correctly. Am I alone?

I'd rather avoid mistakes (copying wrong address), typos and hypothetical malware that is changing copied addresses. I usually check just several digits, but that may not be the best solution.

**Example of the problem:**

Are this 18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ and this 18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcC1jnzKWEg5VZ addresses identical?
They're not and it is also impossible to tell it at a glance.


So that's my idea of improving this experience - **bitcoin address color swatches** as a reduced, graphical representation of actual addresses but **easy to distinguish and compare by human eye** instantly; because it's waaay easier to do it with colors than long numbers.
I'd suggest limiting the number of colors to 4 (definietely not more than 7).

It can be done eg. by:

1) Hashing the address

2) Slicing it into pieces

3) Converting each piece into several colors (and/or numbers)


**Dirty proof of concept of the solution:**

Compare color swatches of this address:
[18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ](http://smietnik.xon.pl/bacs/index.html?address=18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ) and this one: [18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcC1jnzKWEg5VZ](http://smietnik.xon.pl/bacs/index.html?address=18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcC1jnzKWEg5VZ)

See the difference? Easier?

I can imagine a situation where something like this becomes a standard for most wallet/transaction software so it's just easier for people to visually compare and identify the addresses.

What do you think?

I'm suggesting graphical representation of bitcoin addresses that will help humans identify and compare them ([example](http://smietnik.xon.pl/bacs/index.html?address=18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ)).",4

127,"**We can show** with game theory that there is an equilibrium that could drag mining to a crawl. - Here's how:

Let's say there is someone (*Mr X*) who controls 10% of the mining pool. Let's also refer to a block-duration at a set difficulty as an """"""""*era*"""""""". (Sorry not sure the correct term).

Mr X mines, then during one era (call it era 1) he stops mining.

This drops the difficulty during era 2, when he mines again. This means the difficulty during era 3 is higher, when he again stops mining. He gets to mine during lower difficulties and stops mining during higher difficulties.

Because of the knife-edge of profitability, and his relatively large mining power (though crucially nowhere near 51%) other rational miners will spot the pattern and also only mine during *even* eras, it doesn't make sense for them to mine the harder to get coins.

This causes further difference between the """"""""easy"""""""" short eras and the """"""""hard"""""""" long eras. The wilder the swings, the more sense it makes to only mine during the short eras. You get the same average reward as the long era (your % of the total mining power of the blocks) but your electricity is only on for the short era.

Game theory says that everyone should join this miner in their strategy. Eventually there won't be any mining during the hard blocks which will cause it to last forever.

So much smart money behind it

We've already seen it contract following relatively massive breakouts before and return ti breakout again

If places like overstock.com (and sort of Microsoft)  accept it even though it's volatile right now they must see some potential right? 

What im not so sure about 

Do these companies really keep their bitcoins or do they get it sell it immediately and just use it for publicity and to get more customers?

If you are an industry member but would like to vote, you will need to become an individual member. Individual memberships are $25/year or $250/lifetime. To join, visit https://bitcoinfoundation.org/join/

If you are not sure if your membership is active, please email membership@bitcoinfoundation.org. 

If you need to renew your membership, you can do so here: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/join/

Today (Friday, Feb 6) is the last day to join or renew your membership to be eligible for this election.

**Also, as per our bylaws, members who wish to participate in voting need to confirm their status as active members.  For further information on why, see this pull request.**

I want to vote, how do I confirm myself as an active member

Simple.  Login to https://members.bitcoinfoundation.org, click on the “Election” tab, and follow the on screen instructions.

When is the deadline to confirm myself as an active member?
Please note that new members must join by February 6th to get voting rights. February 10th is the last day for current members to confirm as an active member. After that we cannot guarantee that you’ll receive a ballot, but we will try.

Where can I find out more information about the election?
You can find more information by reading this blog post.

The confirmed and final list of candidates eligible for an individual board seat will be announced in an elections mailing next week. Stay tuned!*

Essentially, you need to

1) make sure your membership is not expired
2) make sure your email address is confirmed
3) confirm your status as an eligible member (membership portal, different account than the Forum)
4) receive further instructions? (still unclear as to how members will vote but it seems it will be through an email)",3

196,"From an outsider's perspective, what Bitcoin price target does the Bitcoin community believe in?  $1,000 per coin?  $10,000 per coin?  $100,000 per coin?  Whatever it may be, let us do our part to help make it more well-defined in order to establish clearer consensus.
  
As such, what clear set of reasons can we agree on, focus on, and promote in order to most beneficially educate and shape the behavior of supply and demand acting in the market?
  
In my opinion, a clear, simple, and easily repeatable case exists for pricing Bitcoin similarly to gold.  Bitcoin is above and beyond gold in many respects, but the bitcoin/gold comparison is an easy anchor point from which to reasonably discuss Bitcoin as a mulltiple trillion dollar market-cap player.

Reasoning:
  
1.  Today, I can more easily purchase, store, and transfer Bitcoin than I can gold.  
  
2.  While gold's historical role as a store of value is impressive and well-established, Bitcoin is more scarce than gold.  Bitcoin is more divisible than gold.  Bitcoin is more easy to transport than gold.  Bitcoin is more verifiable than gold.  And, in terms of its trans-continental transactability, Bitcoin-the-network is more durable than gold-the-network.
  
3.  In 2013, about $320 million of gold was mined per day.  Presently, about 3600 bitcoins are mined each day.  In terms of new money flow, this suggests that a base price of about $88,888 per bitcoin can be supported, if Bitcoin were valued similarly to gold.  Interestingly, $88,888 per bitcoin equates to a Bitcoin market cap of only $1.2 trillion (counting 21 million bitcoins), whereas the total market cap of all 6 billion ounces of gold estimated to be in circulation is currently around $7.2 trillion.  This suggests, in terms of overall supply, that a price of about $340,000 per bitcoin can be supported, if Bitcoin were valued similarly to gold.
  
Let us agree on Bitcoin's superiority to gold and make publicly known our unified, well-reasoned base target price of $88,888 per bitcoin.

197,I'm hosting a FIFA tournament this weekend and I like to see if there is a way I can effectively pool the money into 1 wallet for the winner of the tourney. Any ideas?,3
198,"I'm building a wallet which has a """"""""Confirm transaction"""""""" pane which displays the destination Bitcoin address after the user scans a Bitcoin QR code, and the user should check the address is correct.

For usability purposes, I only want to display as many characters as necessary - and no more - to not compromise security. My idea is to only display the first few characters, enough to guarantee that no attacker could create an address with the same first characters and dupe the user to send funds to his address.

According to [this Vanitygen page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Vanitygen_keysearch_rate), an AMD Radeon 58XX or 68XX GPU can search through 23.5 Mkey/s. Assuming an attacker is really well equipped, and can do 25 Gkey/s for a whole year, then an attacker can search through `25*10^9*60*60*24*365` keys.

Since Bitcoin addresses are represented in base58 (disregarding the first character in a Bitcoin address being fixed to 1 or 3), if I show 12 characters after the first character, then the probability of an attacker succeeding is [0.054% according to my calculations](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+%28%2858%5E12+-+1%29%2F58%5E12%29%5E%2825*10%5E9*60*60*24*365%29).

I think the porn industry could really make great use of bitcoin by giving their customers the option to download / stream individual movies from their directories. So if you would prefer to just watch one video you could send a small payment of say 50c instead of buying a monthly subsribtion.

I NEVER pay for porn and im sure the majority of people probably dont either, especially when there are plenty of free streaming sites out there, but lets face it the quality of these are sh*t.

I would actually be willing to pay on the top level production sites if i had this option. You could then scroll through their catrgories, pornstarts etc, view a quick 30 second preview and then bam bitcoin sent and its happy time! No one wants to be locked into an invasive recurring credit card contract/bill especially when its associated with porn.

The porn industry grosses as much as $14 billion annually and i think it would profit even more if it utilized anonymous micro transactions. Just think about what an industry that big could also do to help bitcoin boom.

&gt;Job Description: Digital currencies like Bitcoin have captured the imagination of the press. Related startups are generating a great deal of VC interest and investment because of the potential significance of any disruption of the financial payment industry. Its fundamental technical innovation is the decentralized transaction ledger called the 'block-chain'. It allows bitcoin to prevent double-spending of currency by recording all transactions in an open ledger without the need for a central authority. Such a distributed, public, secure, peer-to-peer transaction record enables not just the exchange of bitcoins but many secondary uses that the research and startup community are exploring such as digital marketplaces.

Even if a coin is worth $1000, that puts market cap at $21 billion. If 1 billion people use bitcoin, they only have an average worth of $21...

So that gives 3 options:

1 - Bitcoin value goes way higher, to like $10k+ per coin (unlikely imo)

247,"OKCoin has decided to openly share cold wallet security information. Through this transparency, OKCoin aims to assure users of the security of their funds. We hope this helps the industry be more open and welcome feedback and new ideas. 

Our security design philosophy

1. Any equipment connected to the internet is inherently vulnerable.
2. USB drives are unsafe as USB disks may be compromised with viruses. Such a USB virus may automatically record data in a computer network after it's inserted and steal the contents within.
3. No security practice can be reliant on one individual. Any access to cold wallet must require confirmation of two authorized parties.
4. Everyone has the potential to suffer from an unexpected event. Others need to be authorized to access offsite backups in order to ensure safety.
5. Individuals may be kidnapped, so important data must be saved in the highest security bank safe and require in-person access.

Our security design protocol

Private key generation and backup

1. Generate 10,000 private keys and corresponding address on the completely offline computer.
2. Add AES private key encryption on the completely offline computer.
3. Delete the original 10,000 private keys.
4. AES password to be controlled by two OKCoin company personnel in separate locations - one in OKCoin's Beijing office, one in a city on the West Coast of the United States.
5. The two AES master password holders cannot use the same means of transportation at the same time.
6. The address and encrypted private key on the offline computer are displayed in QR code format.
7. The QR code of the address is scanned by another computer to publish the address of the cold wallet in order to receive deposits from our hot wallet. Each cold wallet address will be used only once.
8.The QR code of the encrypted key is printed and stored inside a highly secure bank vault. Even if the holder of the encrypted key was kidnapped, the document is secure as the holder must be present at the bank to retrieve it.
9. The QR code of the encrypted key is stored and backed up - one in the bank safe in China, and another in a city on the East coast of the United States.
10. Access to these two banks are granted to two separate people.
11. These two people do not take transportation together.
12. Those with access to the bank safes cannot be the same as the ones who control the AES password.

Depositing bitcoins from online hot wallet to offline cold wallet

1. Once public address of cold wallet is retrieved, deposits of bitcoins can be made from the hot wallet. For security reasons, each address cannot exceed 1,000 bitcoins.
2. Each address will also no longer be used after a single outbound transaction.

Retrieving bitcoins from offline cold wallet

1. Send personnel to the bank safe near the office and retrieve the appropriate number of unused encrypted private keys. Scan the QR code of these keys into an offline computer.
2. The QR code is scanned into another completely offline computer.
3. The holder of the AES master password decrypts the encrypted private key on a completely offline computer.
4. The private key is scanned using QR code to import into another entirely offline computer.
5. Signing trading on another computer completely offline, and after the transaction signature synchronized to a computer with internet broadcast transaction through USB drive.

Highlights of the OKCoin security protocol

1. The cold wallet addresses can only hold a limited amount of Bitcoins.
2. Private keys are stored on completely offline computers.
3. Certainty that the private key never had any contact with the internet or USBs.
4. Encrypted private key paper document requires offsite backup, and is controlled by different people in different places.
5. AES private key password shall also be controlled by different people in different places, and shall not be the same person with the master of the private key.
6. Holders of the AES private key password and those with the ability to retrieve the encrypted private key are different people and in different places.
7. Once a private key has been used to transfer Bitcoin out of the address, the address is no longer to be used again for deposits.

Targets that our security protocol hopes to achieve

1. Cold wallet Bitcoins spread across multiple private keys.
2. Accessing any private key requires two people - the holder of the AES password, and the holder of the bank safety deposit box.
3. There are backups for both the AES password and holder of the bank safety deposit box spread geographically. In the case of unexpected events, bitcoins are still safe.
4. Encrypted private keys are kept in bank vaults. Even if any personnel is kidnapped, the victim cannot be forced to obtain access to bitcoins.
5. Each cold address can only be transferred once and the address will be void thereafter.",3
248,"Hi

With today's Bitcoin price, most of you think it's quite difficult to find a miner that will pay back for itself in less than a few months. 

What you do not realize is that you carry the most profitable and efficient in your pocket every day. Yes, I am talking about your smartphone. 

Before you call me crazy, hear me out. There is an app for iOS and Android (4.1+ if I'm not mistaking) called """"""""Perk TV"""""""". You make points for watching videos. No worries, the videos play automatically. 1,000 = $1. 

My $20 Walmart Android phones make me $1 a day each. That's just 20 days to pay back for itself. You will not find a Bitcoin miner like that. 

After you accumulated enough points, you go to Perk's other app called """"""""Perk Wallet"""""""" and redeem your points for Bitcoin via Coinbase. The only problem is that there is a fee. Remember how I said 1,000 points = $1? That's for the gift cards. For Bitcoin it's 25,000 points = $20 of BTC etc. (the fee increases as you redeem for more Bitcoin, but the % doesn't change). 

I wish you all luck. If you want to help me out, use my referral code when you first sign up for Perk TV - 2441b496. I will receive 500 points when you first redeem for a reward. 

If you have any questions of need tips, PM me. Have a great werkend. ",3
249,"I'm done.  
  
I'm done trying to convince friends and family that they need to find a few hundred extra dollars in their budget for a bitcoin or two...  *just in case*.

And the excuses never end...  Someone has to retile their bathroom, there just isn't any money!  Someone else has to move to a larger apartment...  Maybe he will find some money when tax season comes around...  Another just doesn't have it..  Money is *so tight*!  
  
I'm here, very well paid, with the ability to live a very comfortable life.  And yet, many nights I am eating ramen noodles and drinking cheap vodka when I want a buzz.   Know why?  So I can afford (squeeze) another bitcoin in the budget each month.  
  
And you're telling me you can't scrape up $300 from somewhere?  One person had enough to buy three bitcoins, but just couldn't stomach the thought they might buy and the price of bitcoin might drop... Please...  Go back to unicorn and rainbow land...  What is with this latest generation of men who can't stomach the idea of risk?   
  
And this is why there will always be debt slaves...  Most of the population is too scared to risk their comfort for a chance at something greater...  Even when the outcome is nearly assured in their eyes!  
  
They would rather buy some superfluous silliness now instead of saving their money in what is assuredly a once in a century opportunity... It is very sad, but I am realizing that I cannot help them.

Bitcoin's blockchain or ledger is special because it is collectively managed with no trusted entities i.e. it's decentralized, and the units are predictably limited in supply.

Hey ####,

My name is #### and I'm with the Customer Experience team. Thank you for your inquiry about bitcoin as a payment/payout option. Right now, we sadly don't have any plans to add bitcoin anywhere in the near future. I'm personally not too familiar with bitcoin, but I imagine it must be similar in nature to PayPal. As such, I imagine it would be a very convenient alternative to use on our site for certain users. Although we do not have that listed as an option right now, PayPal is the fastest method we have when it comes to payments in general. So, if you're looking for speed, I would suggest possibly trying that out.

We are always accepting feedback on how to improve our site in all aspects. As such, if you would like, I can send up your feedback to our technical team that works on improving the site. If you'd like me to do that, just let me know. Or if you have any other questions, also let me know that. Thanks!

Best wishes,

Look, I'm no business, I'm just a college student who spent the last year learning linux enough to do this, yes I did follow tutorials in the past, but all those efforts were clunky and failed. I now know a few tricks and this is the result. Sorry for taking over a year, I'm not a full-time or paid developer.

($1.60 every time someone downloads and I have no idea how to charge magic internet money to pay for that). It's far more efficient for me to load it onto an SD card for each major improvement (and include a tutorial for those who want to do it manually - for bit-core releases).

Nonetheless, each MicroSD card I send out has a fully working blockchain that is within 1 month of the current chain. Minimal time to get current. (Tested and it works!)

288,"Just an observation I have made:

The block time of bitcoin essentially puts a ceiling on the velocity of bitcoin in on-chain transactions, as 1 BTC could be used in a maximum of 6 x 24=144 transactions per day. Assuming that transactions are not widely considered verified to respend until 6 confirmations, this is reduced further to a maximum of 24 transactions per day at most.

This essentially means that the value per BTC must rise greater than otherwise (if there were no such limit imposed on velocity by the protocol) if BTC becomes widely adopted. As the monetary theory of money states

M x V = P x Q

M is limited per the protocol to the current maximum supply of BTC, which will eventually be 21 million, but also
V is limited as above to 24 transactions per day

So M x V has a maximum value, no matter how large the BTC economy grows to eventually (Q). As Q grows, P (price level) must shrink, i.e. deflation.",3

294,"Tell me, what is it?

I believe that at some point in the future, it will become the global currency of the world. Not only is it better than traditional currency, it's better than traditional currency and gold combined. It's essentially gold, cash, and the credit card system all rolled into one. It integrates the strengths of each, but leaves the weaknesses behind. 

It has the limited supply quality of gold, but can be used to purchase everyday items. It has the convenience of a credit card, but uses a highly secure network where transactions occur instantly. Like cash, it doesn't require sensitive information to be shared, but it's not an attractive currency to use for illegal purposes since transactions are recorded on a public ledger (*criminals will eventually learn*). Now I ask you, what is it?

Not sure yet? Here are more clues.

- Unlike currencies, you will always know the exact quantity that will ever exist
- Unlike currencies, the threat of currency devaluation by increasing the money supply does not exist as governments / banks do not control the number of units that exist
- Unlike gold, it is easily and perfectly divisible
- Unlike gold, it is easily transferred from one party to another
- Unlike gold, storage costs are minimal and nonrecurring
- Unlike credit cards, there is no risk of identity theft when making a purchase (*as this information is not provided / needed*)
- Unlike credit cards, there is no threat of fraud or charge-backs (*once received, it's yours*)
- Unlike credit cards, there is little to no cost in transferring funds from one party to another (*CC companies typically charge merchants around 3% to transact within their network*)
- Unlike banks and credit cards, transactions are settled in minutes and seconds, rather than """"""""business days""""""""
- Unlike banks and other money transfer systems, there is little to no cost for sending funds outside of the country. (*Banks typically assess a wire transfer fee of around $30*)

Now you tell me. Does this currency / commodity / technology hybrid have a future? Does this sound like something that could evolve into the predominant worldwide currency / money transfer system in the world? If so, learn about it, understand the proper security measures to ensure safe storage, and be prepared to witness the greatest financial innovation that has ever occurred.

Below is a non-exhaustive list, and I may have missed some:

* Mascot (of sorts) for bitcoin: the honeybadger of money

* Bear whale - not really a mascot but an iconic moment in bitcoin's price struggle.

Slogans:

Vires in Numeris (Strength in numbers) my personal favorite of the many great slogans.

Today we made an [announcement](https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/04/07/introducing-bitcoin-hackathon-v2/) on our blog saying that we're giving away $20k of bitcoin to people building bitcoin apps (a hackathon), along with some other stuff (Boost.VC investment to the winner, guest judges, etc). Not an earth shattering announcement by any means, but overall a positive thing for the bitcoin community that will generate some cool new apps and developer interest.

Yet you probably never heard about it.

The first post on /r/bitcoin which went live linked to our blog post.
http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31s4gz/introducing_the_bitcoin_hackathon_v2/

Combined up and down votes came to a total of 0, along with a nice """"""""Fuck off Coinbase"""""""" message.

Some media decided to write about the hackathon, and thinking the above situation was sort of strange, I went ahead and posted a link to one of the articles:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31son1/adam_draper_fred_wilson_and_gavin_andresen_to/

Same thing happend: 2 upvotes and and a nice """"""""fuck off Coinbase"""""""" message by the same throw away account.

This is especially surprising if you consider that last year when we ran the exact same Hackathaon, it got 289 upvotes. http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1xu0ot/coinbase_launches_bithack_an_online_bitcoin/

Seems pretty obvious it would get upvotes. You don't even have to use the Coinbase API at all - you can literally build any cool app that uses bitcoin in any way and we will give you free money. The outrage!

I've been trying to think about how this happened. My only theories are:

**1. Reddit voting ring detection is busted and is downvoting us incorrectly**

There are a bunch of Coinbase employees in one office behind a single IP, and some of them might have upvoted it (although we discourage this in case it triggers voting ring detection). I can't imagine more than a few Coinbase employees upvoted it, if any, before it got downvoted though, so I'd be a little surprised if this was the case.

**2. There are bots or trolls actively down voting Coinbase stuff**

This seems plausible given the throw away account chiming in on both posts.  But they would need (I assume) more than a troll or two to actively down it into oblivion.

**3. There is some other explanation I haven't considered**

I have noticed that a lot of our posts that make it to /r/bitcoin have very binary outcomes - either they sail to the front page and get upvoted to the moon, or some trolls snag the first few votes, and it never sees the light of day.

Anyway, if there is some other theory I would love to hear it - it would really suck if people were figuring out ways to manipulate reddit's voting for any purpose.  Even if you don't like Coinbase, hopefully we can all get behind preventing voting rings (and giving money to bitcoin developers).

So...what the gosh darn heck is going on?

316,"Hello,

We would like to introduce ourselves to the community as OCD JERKY, “Premium quality handcrafted beef”.  We admire the bitcoin community and would love to be apart of something special. After getting our business close to commercial production, we though it would be a good idea to check in and establish a friendly relationship with the community. 

We started this thread to talk about the role bitcoin will play in our business, how we can better ourselves with bitcoin and to get some community feedback. We want to know your thoughts and suggestions on how we can improve our business with bitcoin. It is an amazing technology that will change the world forever. Personally, I am a bitcoin fan that has spent the past couple years obsessed with BTC and anything crypto related.


**A bit about us:**

We are a small startup located in Perth, Western Australia. Our company is devoted to making premium quality beef jerky. We do not add any artificial colours, flavours or preservatives. Only the finest herbs, spices and sauces are used to flavour prime Aussie beef. Marinated for 24hrs and charcoal filter air dried. The result is a delicious artisan beef snack. It is unlike other products and will become a market leader. The jerky is unique and with a small popular product, it is easy to ship worldwide. Bitcoin will play a central role in our payments allowing us to conduct frictionless cross border transactions. It is our preferred payment method that we can be certain there will be no reversals or associated fraud.

**Positive adoption:**
 
Our series 1 packaging (140k units) has the famous B on the back that will be seen by over 140,000 people! Our next batch will contain more information and even refer to an appropriate site, perhaps bitcoin.org. Curious snackers can learn about bitcoin and even find out how to get there hands on some. We have thrown a few ideas around and thought to drop loaded paper wallets in random packaging for lucky people. Its quite an incentive to learn about bitcoin when you have a few in your packet! Were open to ideas and can rapidly adapt our business module to accommodate. The bitcoin community has access to OCD and were listening. What can we do to help? 

**Integration:**

As you know OCD JERKY is crazy about bitcoin and we want to accept btc inside our online store! Right now we don’t know how to do this. Our site is with Squarespace and their integration is some time off. We chose them because they have nice layouts that are simple to use. After building the site, we find we can’t integrate BTC into the cart. For now we decided to set up an OTC thread and manually conduct trades on bitcointalk. It may be inefficient but it is a great opportunity to make some friends and build our reputation. 

We need your help! We have looked into the options but can’t find a solution. So far we see a number of approaches that can embed a buy button or form although these options don’t allow users to select multiple items to cart. Go coin, coinbase and bitpay have been investigated but these only allow the single unit buy button as I can see. Did I miss something? Remember that with Squarespace we can’t simply plug-in a shopping cart and add BTC as payment. Stripe BTC is not yet implemented there. They really have made it hard!

We also started building a site with wordpress but found it too difficult. We had to allocate the time back to the production schedule and make do with our current site. I do agree, if we had the skills WP would be optimal design/SEO.

What are your thoughts? Our budget is stretched and we can’t afford a full build  -we do have plenty of jerky so tell us your ideas! 


**The company** : Right now we are finalising our jerky super-lab for commercial production. We are building a large control room, wiring machinery, painting, renovating and installing the kitchens. Within 3 months OCD JERKY will be in commercial production. We are currently limited to small batch until the factory is established. 

If you want to find out just how good our jerky is, check out our website http://www.ocdjerky.com/ or chase us up on our OTC bitcointalk thread! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1018933.0",4

331,"Hi reddit,

My name is Abby, I am a enthusiastic Bitcoin web developer in Taiwan. I love Bitcoin, because it helps solved many human problems in our society because we are so rely on the banks.

Let me tell you a little story with my poor English, it's a story happened in my trip in the U.S. this February:

After a terrible 4 hours flight delay after my Creating Change Conference in Denver, I arrived in SFO, and catched the very last train (BART) to downtown San Francisco, it's where my hotel located(Mayflower hotel, the facility is not bad.). It's the first day of three day stay in SF.

When I finally arrive to the hotel, it's 30 past 12, it's very very late. After the first nightmare on 4 hours delay, here comes the second.

""""""""I am sorry your credit card doesn't work.""""""""
""""""""WHAT?""""""""
""""""""I am sorry, I don't know.""""""""
""""""""can you try that again?""""""""
""""""""I am sorry, the credit card company charge us very time, so I can't do that.""""""""
""""""""...........uh""""""""
""""""""if you would like to check-in, you have to pay in advance"""""""".
(well, it's 12:30, what's your options?)
""""""""alright, I will pay in cash.""""""""

Well, as least my wallet can pay for that,so I can checked-in and get my room. But the 3rd situation comes, I only got 10 dollar left in my wallet, I need to stay in SF for another 3 days.

After few international calls to my 2 banks in Taiwan, they said I didn't activated the """"""""international withdraw function"""""""" (NOT the international credit card function, so I can still buy stuff using credit card), so I can't withdraw cash in US (it still take with lots fees if you withdraw abroad.) 

Bank transfer?It takes two days or more(and I need a bank account). Western Union? I am not so sure how to make it work,and I need to ask someone go to a bank in Taiwan, that still takes a day.

After a little thinking, """"""""Hey, there is Bitcoin!"""""""".

So I talk to a Taiwanese friend(who is in Bitcoin Community) how can I do, and he suggested some ideas.

Because I can still access my Taiwanese bank account online, so I called a friend, tell him give me his bank account details, and I transferred the money to him.

I asked him to buy some Bitcoin in Familymart convenience store and send it to me. It only takes half an hour, YEAH! 

The next step, I need to buy some US fiat money.

The next morning, I try to find some Bitcoin ATM, first stop, the Workshop Cafe, no luck, the staff said it's moved to somewhere else. Second stop, the Nakamoto's in 20 mission. There 's the Bitcoin ATM(it's the one from Workshop Cafe ), but it seem broken,and no people is there at the stand. (Nakamoto's were day off in the time I was at SF.)

An nice guy who is also work in 20 mission tell me maybe I can go to the local hackerspace called """"""""Noisebridge"""""""" and give it a shot, when I got there, just a few people with nice smile and willing to hear my story and ask me to try to post on their maillist. After that, there are two nice Bitcoin guy came to Noisebridge and do the exchange with me. And I even met with the founder of Noisebridge - Mitch Altman.

Although people said SF might be the most advanced place on using Bitcoin, but I still take half a day to have some fiat money. And I didn't get a clear information about Bitcoin accepted shops/restaurants in downtown SF, that's a little pity.

But anyway, I had 3 great days in SF, thanks for the help, Satoshi.

The dollar bills look much nicer because it's exchanged by Bitcoin. HAHA

All outgoing ports are open and incoming is set to drop. With the exception of allowed ports. When I disable all firewall rules the Bitcoin node works fine and gets about 25+ connections. At peak I've seen it around 30 - 40 connections but seems to stick around 25. Thing is when I turn on firewall it starts dropping almost immediately and slowly works it way down to around 10-14 or so connections. If I restart Bitcoin it slowly climbs up to about this amount also and stops. If I disable the firewall immediately it starts climbing again and will within a few minutes be back to around 25 connections. It works fine with fail2ban enabled in this case and disabling fail2ban has no effect on this. The same behavior is exhibited with my Litecoin node as well.

347,"I pulled this from an altcoin's blog. It is the best explanation I have seen to explain how bitcoin or any digital currency works. I will be using it from now on when I explain Bitcoin.


How are digital currencies created?

Just like physical currencies, digital currencies (like AppleByte) don’t just pop into existence, they have to be made. In physical currencies, paper bills are printed and coins are minted by government agencies, then distributed into the banking system. In the same way digital currencies must be created and distributed to users.

In a digital currency like AppleByte, the currency is created by a software application. This software runs on each computer connected to the AppleByte network. All of the computers connected to the network work together, sharing the complex calculations necessary to create each AppleByte, and a certain number of AppleBytes are created each day. This process is called mining, and is not free, as it costs computer power and electricity. To compensate computer owners for their work, AppleBytes are paid to the software users connected to the network... 


How are balances kept and transactions processed?

Just like at your bank, your account balance and transactions are stored on a server. At your bank, the bank owns the server. But, as a digital currency, AppleByte’s account data resides on a peer-to-peer (computer-to-computer) network that consists of all the computers logged into the network. This allows for additional security as there is no single server that hackers can attack, and each transaction is verified by all the computers on the network. Just like logging into your bank account with your browser, you can see your AppleByte balance and spend them using the AppleByte Wallet App. The wallet gives you all the info you need, just like using your browser for banking transactions. The Wallet App is available in several versions:  Online, MAC, Windows, Android, and IOS...

355,"Bitwage
I first ran across this company from a new article about someone receiving part of their paycheck in BTC. I was intrigued by this and did a little research. I ran across this little company “Bitwage”.
Bitwage will take all or part of your paycheck – purchase bitcoin – and send that BTC to the wallet of your choice. The sign up was relatively simple. All it consisted of was your email and to create a new password. From there you would fill in your employers information (address, phone number, company name, company website). After you have completed this you would choose to get BTC or fiat If you choose Fiat the money will be loaded onto your Xapo wallet and you could request a debit card that you can use anywhere. If you chose BTC they would convert your fiat to BTC and send it straight out to your wallet.
Bitwage will provide you with a ACH form you bring to your employer and you can designate as much of your paycheck as you would like to go straight to Bitwage and the rest of your check to get sent to the bank of your choice. Sense Bitwage is new they are offering their services commission free for the time being.
My experience went very smooth. I brought the forms to my employer and told them I want %5 sent to this account. The payroll department didn’t have to even know what BTC is in order to implement it. Once the funds are sent to Bitwage via direct deposit they are then exchanged for BTC (they advertise they will give you the best price from when your deposit was made until its sent to your wallet.
Bitwage does take an extra day processing your BTC so for instance if you get payed on a Wednesday you probably wont receive your BTC deposit until Thursday. There support team is very helpful and attentive to concerns of their clients.
If you have anymore questions about this service please leave a comment or PM me.

356,"As far as I can tell, all major world currencies have unique alphanumeric serial numbers printed on their fiat notes. In the scenario above, cash notes could be tokenized on the blockchain and continue to circulate. Consumers would have a choice to operate with crypto wallets, fiat paper notes, or both. Countries would purchase bitcoin to secure satoshis to back their fiat notes and would retain the private keys. Creation and destruction of fiat notes would be visible on the blockchain. The exchangeability would be verifiable as consumers experienced redeeming their notes for BTC or vice versa. Consumers could elect to bypass the backed fiat notes entirely and just operate with BTC on exchanges, if desired. 

Early nations to adopt this """"""""gold standard"""""""" would benefit through increased purchasing power as other nations came on board. Fiat notes could be modified to contain public addresses and QR codes to verify their respective value at any time. Benefits would be:

 * transparency of the supply of national currencies 
 * shortening of the learning curve for mass adoption of bitcoin (consumers still hold fiat paper notes) 
 * bitcoin's fixed supply would become the default reserve currency
 * mitigation of counterfeiting

Sorry for the late reply. We've been busy outside helping with the community. Had a big tremor today around noon that got everyone shook up.

We've touched base with the Hospitals here to remind them of our assistance for those unable to cover their own medical costs. Quite a few houses were lost - but again this is nothing in comparison to Kathmandu and the destruction there. We'll be meeting with the local community tomorrow to do needs assessments of homes and schools. It's difficult today due to the ongoing tremors and also all community members are still sleeping in the streets and open spaces are they are afraid to go inside. Phone network comes and goes so widespread communication via the mobile network has been spotty. I'm prepared to help any schools or families who have been affected by this here. Including anything that comes up in neighboring districts that I hear about.

I'll try and call tomorrow. I'll write more tonight if I can. Was unable to sleep last night and have been on the go for the last 36 hours trying to help. 

Really appreciate all your efforts. Of course, if any funds raised cannot be leveraged here I will ensure they are given to a partner org that follows the same mindset as us in Kathmandu. I will have more details of how we can get involved tomorrow.

Some services that I have paid automatically every month for years are still charging to my expired cards. I just haven't updated them, and there's been no need to, they're just recurring transactions that the card company is familiar with and they just honor it.

Many people have recurring charges, they just know they have them, put the money in the bank and let automatic bill pay or those services take it.

Automatic bill pay, or recurring charges should be built into some wallets. There can also be a feature where you're wallet is subscribed to receive the amount if it varies by month and you can choose to authorize the transaction or set it to automatic.

There will also be a need to build in the subscription service into the wallet for the business side. It would take both sides to connect and verify to approve the connection.

375,"India is very diverse country. Culturally, politically, religiously, and yes financially! More than 35% of India's people live below poverty line, earning less than $2 a day. Unfortunately, there is not much hope for these people on the horizon, and there isn't much Bitcoin can do for them. I am going to talk about the other two categories who can benefit a lot. These are the middle class, and the filthy rich who have undeclared income/assets.

In India, the middle class which is huge and growing, is extremely limited with their budgets. Usually only one member earns for the whole family. These families are further divided into lower middle class, middle middle class and upper middle class, with an annual income between $10,000 to $100,000. As your income raises, so do your expenses because of your social status. People in India are very concerned about their status, and its not uncommon for people to show off by borrowing out of their means. Especially in northern India, people will take out huge loans to buy expensive cars and huge houses, just so that they are seen as rich. Point being, the middle class is very limited with their budgets and that extra money can help them a lot!

Now comes the other class of the filthy rich. These are usually businessmen who hide their actual income from the authorities in order to evade taxes. This is very very common in India. Just google """"""""problem of tax evasion in india"""""""". These people have a lot of money as cash, usually stacked up in bank lockers. They are always on the lookout to park their money somewhere safe. Traditionally, they would buy up real estate in cash, and declare only a fraction of the amount paid as the sale price. But the authorities have recently started cracking hard on this practice. Other alternative was to park the money offshore using """"""""hawala"""""""" transactions. But there is a crackdown on these too, due to concerns of terrorism funding.

Most of the people in middle class are salaried people, employed in govt or private companies and their income is almost always 100% white (fully declared and taxes deducted at source). And a lot of the business income is black (undeclared).

How can Bitcoin be useful? People with white money can (not very easily, but legally) transfer their money to international exchanges and buy bitcoins. People with black money can buy those coins off of them with cash, at a premium. Both the groups will benefit. At the end, people with lower income but white money will have a little extra and the people with black money will have a very fungible asset that they can transfer anywhere in the world.

So whats the problem? Unlike China, Bitcoin exposure is VERY limited in India. My guess would be only 1 in 1000 have ever heard about it. So there is a need for better marketing in India. There is also a potential business opportunity of entrepreneurs in India, as most of the people are not that tech savvy to handle all this themselves.",4

379,"Recently I was able to interview one of my favorite musicians and audio engineers, Steve Albini about decentralization as well as Bitcoin for my podcast, [decentralize.fm](http://decentralize.fm). I wrote a [blog](http://tonyswish.tumblr.com/post/118408128705/i-just-interviewed-one-of-my-heroes-for-my-podcast) about Steve's background and why getting the chance to talk to someone so brilliant about Bitcoin was so important to me and I would encourage the community to give it a quick read and a listen.

First and foremost I would like to express gratitude toward those who have shared the podcasts we have done with celebrities and notable people interested or even skeptical about Bitcoin. James Walpole, Eric Martindale and Chaz Ferguson do so much hard work for this show and we believe we have done something completely different from any other podcast around and we really want to encourage the community to spread the word. This isn't about us, it's about really neat projects and the idea of personal empowerment.

The high profile people we have contacted about appearing on decentralize.fm have been strategic and we make it a point to not just book people for attention or who genuinely don't care. 

Steve Albini was different as he was extremely negative on Bitcoin going in. His negativity toward the subject was honest in that he simply does not care about anything to do with Finance, and actively dislikes most people involved in the field. I went out of my way to express to him that I actually agreed and went on to provide articulate answers until to my shock he agreed.

The reason he originally turned it down made sense to me and it's something that a lot of people in Bitcoin communities fail to bring up when it comes to spreading the word about Bitcoin. Before, during and after my time at BitPay, every idea I would notice had to do with spending money on things including Ad Campaigns, sponsorships and a bunch of other wacky ideas that really wouldn't do very much. My belief is that the best way to promote Bitcoin is through honesty and increasing the messaging of it to people who are intelligent and notable. My personal experience led me to believe there is something to this strategy as many of the connections I have made have developed into friendships and people who are genuinely into Bitcoin.

The problem is, so many people in the world absolutely loathe financial types. Since Bitcoin is something covered by the financial media, an immediate assumption is made by many that it is something they just do not care about. They don't see the people upset with the financial system who became huge fans of Bitcoin, they see suits, Wall-Street Types and Libertarians who talk about Liberty and make people care even less. To illustrate how little average people care about Financial media, earlier this year a VERY large and well known financial news cable channel had ratings that were at a 20+ year low with about 177,000 people watching on average. This is a horrendous number and after it was reported, the channel stopped using Nielsen shortly thereafter because of how bad it made them look.

I want to make talking about these topics more fun, not silly or juvenile but something that isn't lame ass old white guys talking about charts to an audience of other old white guys reading charts. Although we are not a Cable news outlet with a budget and a presence on networks that reach 100+ million homes, our podcasts are going to continue to try to reach notable people and talk about new projects that we think are cool or important.

Decentralize.fm's focus always has and always will be focused on technology, but it's important for us to recognize how important technology is to finance in the present. We are going to continue to get interesting guests on the show and I even have a personal """"""""wish list"""""""" of guests I am trying to have on. Many of these people aren't easy for a show created by four people who work full time in various Bitcoin/Decentralized tech projects, but so far we have been successful and I don't see why we can't continue.

390,"I found bitcoin a couple years ago and have followed it since.  The one thing that always seems to happen (especially in this sub) is that people constantly post videos/articles/ideas that position bitcoin as a new technology that people haven't learned about.   

I think more people know about bitcoin than you think - they just don't need it in their lives.  There is a difference but the effect is the same, no usage (for the common people).  

After years of posting the biggest outlets covering it there is a point where awareness alone isn't how you measure success.  

It might be premature but at what point do we stop getting excited about awareness and start thinking about its intrinsic value?  I guess I just don't see any business implementation as a major deal, it only is if it is used (which I don't think is happening nearly as much). Are we mostly investors in user's clothing?

393,"Lots of people browse Youtube and Soundcloud without creating an account or logging in. If they wanted to give bitcoin tips on those sites then they would have to go through a few extra steps that are not part of their normal routine and can be very annoying. In my case, I have an account on Youtube that I never sign into and don't plan on ever making a Soundcloud account.

To make things easier, and encourage more tipping, we could create a browser plug-in that connects to a tipping bot. When you are on the page of a song or video that you want to tip, just click a button to tell the bot to make a tip on your behalf and it will use its own account on that particular website to complete the process for you. This could speed up and simplify the tipping process for a lot of people. 

It would also make anonymous tipping possible which would protect your social media information from being linked together by Changetip. You don't have to remain anonymous, but it is an option some people might appreciate. With a little bit of extra programming, multi-sig transactions could make it so that the bot never has direct access to your tipping coins, which is also a concern with Changetip since they hold onto your tipping coin's private key.

Does this sound like an idea that somebody would be interested in using or developing? What does /u/changetip think on this matter?",2

Buy bitcoins at an exchange and keep them in a wallet

First, it didn't come in a envelope like I believe others received it in, mine came in a small white box that was securely taped at every corner. Inside the package the entropy was tightly packed with foam peanuts. One thing I did notice about the entropy package itself was there was no holographic security seal on it and just had clear plastic tape around it keeping it sealed. I guess there could be a few reasons for this such as it being a big issue before with broken seals so they were just removed ahead of time. Or other possibility was on a previous post it was said some of the last batch were faulty so they were individually fixed at which point I'd assume whoever did the repair didn't have those seals and just used tape to repackage it?

408,"People are often excited about all the investment going into Bitcoin companies, suggesting that this somehow validates Bitcoin being a brilliant idea.

While, I'm a huge Bitcoin fan, I think this rhetoric is generally misleading.

Typical VC companies invest in dozens and even hundreds of companies. They seek to find obscure businesses that provide a bigger diversification of their portfolio to lower their systemic risks as any smart investor would. 95% of these companies are expected to fail. A few percent of them will make enough money to cover the investment. And if they are lucky and made the right guesses, there will be one or two that are big hits and cover all the losses and generate profit too.

All the Bitcoin investments could simply mean that Bitcoin is a """"""""weird"""""""" enough business that VCs feel it provides the much needed diversification.

VCs may invest in Bitcoin companies on the off chance that they underestimate something great, not because they know it's something great. They are not doing as much homework generally as we assume they do. Nor can they predict anything reliably or they would not invest in those 95% of businesses that fail.

In other words, in my opinion the confidence vote of a VC firm isn't much more than the confidence vote of you or me, they just happen to have much more money.

However, regardless of why VCs do it, the funding does make the Bitcoin economy stronger and more useful every day. And, I truly believe that the VCs are making the right bet on Bitcoin, even if not for the right reason.",3

Dropbox of files: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7dudlieancb1tr0/AAA0xmqujCZsvaQ0f_Uf-03Da?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7dudlieancb1tr0/AAA0xmqujCZsvaQ0f_Uf-03Da?dl=0)

**1. Operating Bitcoin.com facing a new counterparty**
The Ripple FinCen findings related to dealing with Roger Ver set off an internal review related to conducting further business with Mr. Roger Ver. OKCoin’s team came to a decision to discontinue facing Mr. Ver on the management of Bitcoin.com for two core reasons. The first being the findings of the Ripple investigation. The second, on further review, the contract was not in good standing as it did not contain the OKCoin legal entity in the contract. It should also be made aware that OKCoin made every effort to continue management of Bitcoin.com facing a different counterpart under a legally binding contract.

**2. Different Versions of the Contract**
In our review post the Ripple FinCen findings, it was found that v7 (the contract Mr. Ver holds) was not the version of the contract which our finance and accounting department held (v8) digitally and physically. In the past 24 hours, Mr. Ver made public false accusations that CEO Star Xu forged the v8 contract. There was never forgery committed by Star Xu. We would find such forgery to be a serious breach and view the actions of Mr. Ver to assume and claim forgery a seriously misplaced allegation. We will further review every course of action in light of these false accusations by Mr. Ver.  OKCoin holds the original v8 hardcopy contract signed by a former employee at OKCoin and this contract was given to our finance department in December 2014. The document is open to any forensic investigation on the date it was signed. OKCoin also has the digital contract sent to our finance department over QQ on December 16th, 2014 by said former employee. We have provided these screenshots. The former employee and Mr. Ver are friends and formerly worked together at Blockchain.info.

Dropbox Exhibit A

**3. Oath from CEO Star Xu:** 
""""""""I have attached the digital communications and attachment of the v8 contract that my former colleague sent via QQ to our accountant on December 16th, 2014. The digital and hardcopy of the original signed contract by the former employee are held internally by our finance and operation teams. If I am found to have forged the v8 contract, I face legal ramifications. I welcome Mr. Ver to hire a forensic investigator to examine the authenticity of the hard copy contract. I can promise God on my family’s name that I did not forge the contract. I wonder if Mr. Ver and my former colleague would dare make the same oath of honesty.”

**OKCoin will reward $20,000 USD to anyone with authentication skills confirming that the digital and hardcopy of v8 are genuine and signed from December of 2014 by our former employee.**

Those with information can send findings to corporate@okcoin.com 

**4. Mr. Roger Ver going public:**
Mr. Roger Ver first enacted the threat of use of public opinion as a method of pressuring OKCoin into settling on an agreement. Mr. Ver added a reporter Mr. Jon Southurst of Coindesk into the email communications. OKCoin only released a public notice after being contacted by media for comments. It was relayed to OKCoin that Mr. Roger Ver had contacted them to release openly the private communications. We are regretful that this has become a public matter due to the tactics Mr. Ver used. 

Dropbox Exhibit B

**5. Mr. Roger Ver’s accusations of intent to money launder:**
Mr. Roger Ver falsely accused OKCoin of intending to money launder when it is shown in multiple correspondence that a new contract and new counterpart to receive funds were required for continued management of Bitcoin.com. Mr. Ver has repeatedly shown to be quick to bully and make false allegations in his business dealings. No payment was ever made, attempted, nor intended to a counterparty other than Mr. Ver in the course of OKCoin’s management of Bitcoin.com 

Dropbox Exhibit C


**6. OKCoin’s bitcoin.com contained no ads:**
Everyone is free to view the Bitcoin.com that was created and used by OKCoin here in the Web Archives: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150315024642/http://www.bitcoin.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315024642/http://www.bitcoin.com/)

There are no OKCoin ads on the Bitcoin.com that we managed. OKCoin paid Mr. Ver $10,000 USD per month and developed and operated the website as agreed upon. We also tried to court interested parties to advertise on the website. Mr. Ver continually threatened to use the one month termination notice clause contained in the contract for failing to generate further revenue. These threats occurred while simultaneously asking and expecting OKCoin to continue in good faith to improve Bitcoin.com despite that overhang. Mr. Ver even suggested to redirect Bitcoin.com to OKCoin or OKLink for an exorbitant sum.. 

Mr. Ver sought to close the agreement for the full $550,000 USD dollars remaining followed by an attempt to ask for $200,000 or lower. Mr. Ver did not care for the proper management of Bitcoin.com but was rather solely focused on extracting more money from it. 

We have provided the sources of these communications.

Dropbox Exhibit D

**7. OKCoin is not insolvent:**
To our disappointment, this public slander by Mr. Ver included directly speculating that OKCoin is insolvent, under financial duress and may become the next Mt. Gox. These actions show a lack of respect and proper due diligence. Time will prove that OKCoin’s financial health is strong. We are currently executing on several business projects in the fintech space to improve the lives of consumers and businesses. We generate healthy revenues and have received significant venture capital investments. Our customer service is 24/7 and we welcome any user who has funds on OKCoin to test and withdraw funds.  

It should be noted that Mr. Ver prior to the Mt. Gox event reported to the public that Mt. Gox had no problems as can be seen in this video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4SCAw264qM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4SCAw264qM)

**8. OKCoin’s commitment to innovation:**
We would like to apologize to our customers for this distraction and for wasting your time over such a small matter. OKCoin will continue to release better and better products as a leader in financial technology and we would like to thank again our customers and supporters of our company. ",3
415,"Personally I only see cons.

Increasing the block size will put extra costs on the users. These costs include: 20x the required bandwidth, 20x more disk space needed relative to time, 20x the required processing power to verify the blocks.

1- Bandwidth required: 34.1 KB/second of the available bandwidth. This may be too much for some people with slow internet connections to run a node, especially people in third world countries. These people will be forced to use trusted and centralized online wallets, or more probably go to the more trusted / less hackable / less volatile and less centralized banks.

2- Disk space: 2880 MB/day, 84.4 GB/month. If you have a 2TB hard drive this would be enough to fill it up in 655 days and you will not be able to free space by moving block files to an external HD or flash drive. Every day there will be more people dropping out of the network because of this requirement. More centralization, more reliance on online wallets.

3- Processing power: harder to calculate than the other two, but the effect will be the same, more expensive to run a node, easier to use a trusted third party.


Advantages:
More penny transactions with zero fees getting transmitted from node to node and saved on lots of hard drives forever.


The way I see it, all this does is sacrifice Bitcoin's core advantages as a trustless and decentralized payment network in favor of cheaper / less competitive transactions. Right now it costs 3¢ to include a transaction in the blockchain. This is insanely competitive with other payment methods and still Bitcoin is not as popular.


Does it make sense to add that extra load on the network and make running full nodes that much harder just to keep it at 3¢ or push it even lower? Wouldn't it be better for Bitcoin if competition for block space increased over time? What am I missing?",5
416,"While listening to the current debate about increasing the block size I often hear about proposals to add some automated solutions to e.g. let the block size grow over time. Also many people suggested to include other useful stuff in that hard fork so that we don't have to do it again that soon. This all shows the desire to avoid hard forks.

I see it a bit different. I fear a situation where we have lots of big miners having their clusters running and actually not taking part in the discussion and not caring about the current debate. So having a clear situation where almost everyone can agree on (20mb blocks) holds the possiblity to show the miners that a hard fork can be done and at the same time teach miners who don't follow the debate that they should. As long as we get this 20mb hard fork done now this shows that bitcoin can move and adapt and will automatically sort out people who can't. I think it is good to have that from time to time and that's why I think we shouldn't aim for a state in which we will never need a hard fork again.

If miners really don't want a particular change its fine, its their decision and they have every right to make it. But a hard fork shouldn't fail because people are fearing every change or just don't care enough about recent developments. We're all in the same boat and want the best for bitcoin. lets not be sissy's and make it happen",2

Straight to the point; my computer has been a victim of the new ransomware Locker v2.83 

More information about it here: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/373wk0/locker_virus_similar_to_cryptolocker/

And a lot of my important files have been encrypted, I need to make a payment of 0.1 BTC in order to decrypt my files. 

I have 28 hours left on the timer, so this is kind of my last resort. Either I pay or I say goodbye to my files until a tool to decrypt them is out; if that even happens. 


I tried making several accounts in order to do it myself, but every website says it isn't available in my country; so I thought I'd ask you guys for help, I will be able to send a paypal payment to whoever is willing to send the payment to the address asked by the ransomware. 

Thanks in advance",2
423,"I'm not sure if I found an easily exploited bug on cex.io but I was able to log into my account today twice without being asked for 2FA. I have 2FA enabled on the account and normally I'm asked to enter it before logging in. Interested I tried a few other things and found 2FA still required to disable 2FA or to withdraw funds; but not to trade. Allowing the a potential attacker to sell the victims funds at any price. Certain conditions apply but still seems like a hole in the main reasons for 2FA. I did some research on a potential bounty program on cex but only came up with a couple posts with people stating that they found potential exploits and reported to cex asking for bounty only to have cex turn around say they already knew about the bug and patch the hole and pay nothing at all or next to nothing considering the potiental of exploit. I talked about it in chat on cex and was informed to submit a ticket and said might be rewarded....I don't mean to sound evil but this seems like a valuable thing and I would like a decent reward for finding considering it works with the right conditions. So for any of you that could answer what do you think something like that is worth? and the best way to make sure payment is agreed on before/received when disclosed?

428,"Hey guys so I just watched this cnn documentary on bitcoins with the guy from """"""""super-size"""""""" me hosting the show. It got me really interested in this whole new way of paying for things/made me feel like I should give it a try. Anyways I have a couple of questions for you experts!

1. If I buy a small amount of bitcoins, is there a chance someone will steal them?

2. Where should I buy my bitcoins from? I only want to play around with them and see how it works/get some experience to start off. I just got $20 in the mail for my birthday and I want to use that for the coins. Do people take cash for bitcoins? If so were, and would they do it even though its such a small amount?

3. Is bitcoin's price something that changes a lot? like if I was to get $20 today is it possible it would only be worth $10 towmorrow?

4. Are wallets insured like banks? If someone steals my coins will the wallet company take the heat or will i?

Thanks guys, I'm very new to all of this but it seems fascinating. Any advice would really help me out.

429,"Or, is there a minimum fee for the fee to be acknowledged?

Are transactions included in order by fee size? So would a 0.00001 BTC fee be prioritized over a 0.000001 BTC fee? And a 0.00000001 BTC fee be prioritized over no fee? 

Would it be accurate to view fees as an effective bidding war on whose transaction is included in the next block the soonest?",3

432,A crucial event like the coming hard fork would benefit from giving a nod to Satoshi. 20 MB would be heresy.,3
433,"I don't think the miners have that much of a choice in case we hardfork to 20MB blocks (or anything above 1MB).


**Why?**

The reason is; will the exchange and other liquidity providers (local traders, etc) switch or not? Once the chain forks the coins that are being send and traded can only be one of the two.

&gt;""""""""But the miners will keep mining the other chain!""""""""

They'd be mining 25BTC coinbase reward they cannot send to the exchange(s) and/or local traders, because they're not """"""""valid"""""""". The exchanges is where the money and liquidity is, hence they decide what are or aren't valid bitcoins.

Sure, if 60% stays on the """"""""old"""""""" version, and 40% goes to 20MB-Fork, the network slows down a lot. And the smaller fork can be attacked more easy, but once 51% is on the new fork **and** the exchanges are over, it's going to be very hard to do anything about it. 

**My opinion:**

**It all comes down to one single simple question to the traders on the markets (the exchanges): Will you switch to the new version or not.**

Now I'm not a pro/con on the 20MB blocksize discussion myself because I think both parties have valid opinions why or why not to do it.

But my opinion remains: the open markets have way more to say than a miner.

------------------------------------

Edit: **Bonus round:** Let's say there are 3 exchanges, and 2 switch to 20MB-Coin. The moment they do, I can send my bitcoins (that now exist) to the 3rd one, and sell them for """"""""real"""""""" USD. So can everyone. **There will be massive selling pressure on the coin the market thinks is """"""""fake"""""""" because the market will decide which one is the Altcoin or not**

Edit: I think its actually impossible to fork Bitcoin. It's a paradox to do so.

436,"Well this community has become an embarrassment. Between the block size debate and the Roger Ver controversy we look like a collection of fools to any outsiders. I never thought I would consider selling this many of my bitcoins but I can not justify holding significant amount of bitcoin in the current environment.

I have no interest in investing in a currency that can only scale to be used by 1/5000th of 1% of the global population. I thought this was a """"""""World Wide Ledger"""""""".

So I will let my money do the talking, selling some coins each day until the block size is fixed or until this community gets serious. 

Cryptocurrency is bigger than Bitcoin and it will move on without Bitcoin. Look what happened to Myspace. Don't get left holding the bag.

445,"Probably one of the core reasons 90%+ of people do not own physical gold in their homes in any material sense. 

People do not want to risk losing their money. The idea of losing an unrecoverable password is not something society is going to accept and adopt. No. Fucking. Way.

We need to move away from this """"""""decentralized banking or bust"""""""" idiocy IF the idea is that the manstream should adopt bitcoin. Bitcoin banks are the saviors and not the enemy, if they are independent from each other.  People will never buy into bitcoin unless the risk of losing them is spread out through banking insurance. 

My hunch is that this community is full of meticulous, possibly anal retentive, OCD, super organizers, but guess what?  A lot of us are disorganized, short on attention, forgetful, and aloof.  We need someone to secure our bitcoins for us because we are distracted and don't have the time or resources to recite our """"""""unique bitcoin passphrases"""""""" every morning to ensure we don't forget them. Nor do we have 10 acres of land where we can bury our steel plate wallets. Fucking daffy.

Bitcoin banks: how can we make them better and how can they be trusted.  If BofA or Chase offered bitcoin for sale, oh me oh my, talk about the moon. It's either they get on board now, or we wait another 30-40 years for another brand to establish monetary trust.

446,"It would be great to see payment channels implemented in most Bitcoin wallets as the default way for mainstream consumers to send payments to anyone.  https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-micropayments shows how to implement payment channels when both sides of the transaction are online.  We'd also need to cover sending to someone who is offline, and potentially address privacy concerns for the recipient.  Payment channels could help offer some level of consumer protection for payments, in addition to vastly increasing Bitcoin's potential transactions per second.

448,"There is a Computer Store in my area. I go there time-by-time to print stuff, ect and also bought my headset there some time ago. It has a lot of IT stuff for sale.

I've been talking with the owner 2 days ago, while waiting for my papers to print and casually asked him what he thinks of bitcoin. He told me that he has heard about it, but never really looked after it.

I told him that maybe he could give it a try and accept bitcoin as payment in the store. He was very hestitant, but told me if i can provide him enough proof that bitcoin can be profitable and give him a good promotion idea, he could maybe adapt it.

So i'm here, asking you nice people: What promotion could work best in this case? It's a small store in a relatively small city where there is no other store that focuses on IT, so it has a market. 

I thought about printing QR codes with some small amounts like 0.20$ - 0.50$ each and letting him give them out with each purchase above a specific limit, but i'm low on bits to do this, so that's out.

Any other promotion ideas that could be done for free or a small cost?",3
