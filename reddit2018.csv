1,"so, like many i'm not 100% clear on how LN functions at the granular level - sometimes u have to jump in with both feet, so thinking about running a few nodes on testnet to learn, but want some advice on my potential setup.

I currently have ""an army"" of ARM devices. i have at my disposal:

- 5 x rpi3 &amp; 5 x rpi2 currently mining XMG - just because i can :)
- 1 x odroid hc1 with 1TB mechnical HDD which is serving as both bitcoin full node (core s/w) plus XMG full node.
- 1 more ordoid hc1 with 1TB mechnical HDD which i can retask - it isnt busy :)

so:

- does each LN need it's own dedicated BTC node, or can LN share BTC nodes?
- assuming yes, is there any benefit or cost (in terms of processing or, well, anything) by running, lets say, 2 sets of 5 ln rpi + 1 hc1 btc node setup? thinking of classic app server/db server structure
- additional: are rpi zeros any good for LN? i've got 6 currently untasked ....

any feedback appreciated :)"

28,"Dear Coinprism user,


The wallet service Coinprism will be shutting down on March 31st, 2018. If you are holding funds in a Coinprism wallet, you must transfer your Bitcoins and colored coins out to another wallet and/or export your private keys before March 31st, 2018.

*Export wallet keys*

Remember that Bitcoins and colored coin funds actually reside on the Blockchain and not on Coinprism, and will continue to exist after Coinprism is shut down, however you will need your private key to access them, which is why it is critical to export it. To do this, visit this page, and after logging in, export your unencrypted keys. You can then re-import or sweep them into any Bitcoin compatible wallet such as Bitcoin Core, Coinomi or Edge. This will recover all your Bitcoins and automatically uncolor any colored coins in your wallet. If you wish to retain your colored coin assets, you must use an Open Assets compatible wallet such as Colorcore.


Best regards,

The Coinprism team"

34,"There have been a few shill threads with botted upvotes recently about a wallet called ""Abra"" being touted as ""the next coinbase."" Do NOT sign up with these people. They are running a huge phishing operation and selling your sensitive information.

They get your name, your phone number, your social security number, your address, your bank account number, your password, then conveniently inform you after gathering all this extremely sensitive information that they will not be servicing you and will not give ANY explanation why. A legitimate exchange HAS to BY LAW disclose the reason why they are denying you service.

This is a scam application. Do NOT use Abra. Coinbase and Gemini may be far from perfect but they are popular for a reason and at least have laws regulating their actions. Abra is located in a third world country and they can take your entire stash and never be heard from again.

40,"This is an email sent mid February in case some of y'all didn't see it. Free transfer is no longer 30 but 10 now. After the 10th free transfer, you will get charged 0.002 BTC per BTC withdrawal or 0.001 ETH per ETH withdrawal at the end of the month. So if I made 20 btc transfer last month, they will debit my account .02 btc, thats like $20 per transfer. You won't know about the debit unless you check your account history, you wont get notification or email about it. Keep track of your transfer

&gt;This email is to notify you that Gemini will be collecting withdrawal fees accrued during February 2018 on March 1, 2018. 

&gt;As a reminder, effective January 17, 2018, we modified our Transfer Fee Schedule pursuant to our User Agreement as follows: starting on February 1, 2018, Gemini will debit your account balance for any withdrawals in excess of 10 complimentary withdrawals per digital asset per calendar month, and the fee per withdrawal in excess of 10 is 0.002 BTC per BTC withdrawal or 0.001 ETH per ETH withdrawal.

&gt;When we debit your account balance, you will see a line in your transaction history that says “a Gemini administrator has debited your account.”

&gt;These withdrawal fees align with current market prices for transaction fees on the BTC and ETH blockchains; however, Gemini is actively working on an initiative to make this a better experience going forward, including:

&gt;Indicating how many free withdrawals you have left per digital asset per calendar month;
Charging withdrawal fees at the time of the withdrawal; and
Using techniques like SegWit transactions and batched transactions to lower fees and save space on the blockchain.
&gt;Should you have any questions, please refer to the our User Agreement.

&gt;Onward and Upward!

My preliminary analysis indicates that a trade war could work to devalue the dollar. China has been pegging the Yuan as devalued in relation to the USD since 2001 when they joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). This has had the effect of tilting the whole playing table so that goods ""roll down hill"" more easily to the US and goods really have an uphill battle getting from the US into China.

Trump is not willing to start off fixing this by devaluing the dollar, so he's using tariffs. But could tariffs have a devaluatory effect on the US Dollar?

If so, bitcoin stands to gain ground even faster than it is now.

See here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-06/a-trade-war-road-map-for-fx-markets-take-cover-find-your-niche

&gt; “It’s a bit of a double-edged sword,” said Tannuzzo at Columbia Threadneedle. “The dollar should ultimately strengthen in the short-term against the currencies affected by the tariffs; in the long-run, it could stay under pressure overall because it has to fund large and growing current-account deficits.”

When currency investors ""take cover"", it would be great if there was a currency that was immune to all this trade war chaos....

47,"GDPR – What’s Important to Retain
There are many important rules companies must follow starting from June 2018, that will actively protect customers against corporations data theft and abuse (ie, selling your data without your consent or creating complicated terms and agreements most users do not fully understand). I advise you to read through the whole thing especially if you (like me) work in IT, are responsible for an IT department or have your own startup; but there’s one single point I believe to be most destructive for many cryptocurrencies:

Yes indeed, each user has the right to be forgotten, meaning, all user data should be able to get permanently deleted. Let’s say if I chose to delete my facebook account, anything I have ever posted, commented, liked, etc has to disappear. It does seem simple when you own your own infrastructure, but due to one of the most important properties of blockchain technology being its immutability, you can already see the problem bubbling up.

Any platform that uses a distributed ledger to store user data (blockchain, Vitalik coin) is, by all means, screwed. There is absolutely no way around this. What if companies just ignore this new enforcement? Well, the fine is only 4% of your company’s revenue, up to 20 Million Euros.

So if you have invested in a project, own a project or are generally interested in better understanding how this market will evolve, please do pay attention to the following: storing any user data on any public distributed ledger is half-way to a really, really, really unpleasantly expensive outcome.

From the top 100 cryptocurrencies, how many can you identify that will face issues due to this new regulation? Platforms that hold user data in any form must assure there is a way for that data to be deleted. Let me underline this again: it means a big no-no to storing any user data on a ledger from where that data cannot be deleted.

What about other rules?
Other key changes can be followed without compromising the concept of immutable distributed ledger technology. If you want more information on the subject I highly advise you to read this article. All these points are explained brilliantly by the author. If you want a more in-depth understanding of how this problem could be avoided see this one. In short, you would have to consider off-chain storing of data; this is, centralized servers.

Now what?
Raise awareness, speak to members of projects where you’re heavily invested and try to read as much as possible on the subject. Learning is the only way you’ll ever feel safe. Your opinion is the one you should value the most, as there is no one who will look-out better for yourself than… well, yourself!

54,"Hi guys,

So long short story, i have a iPhone 6 which I recently got my hands back on. It hasn’t been used since September 2015. At that time, I was using on it the Ninki Wallet ( ninkip2p.com ) Bitcoin wallet. At the time I stopped using the phone I had 2.65 BTC on the wallet. In December 2015, Ninki announced that they are closing their doors and advised everyone to move their funds to a different wallet. Unfortunately I did not do so and now I am trying to recover them.

I have all the info necessary: offline recovery phrase, online recovery phrase and public master key.
The recovery script that they provide is:
https://github.com/Ninkip2p/ninki-recover
The main issue is that it uses a API for fetching data that does not work anymore ( chain.com API ), so when I ran it it replied with this error message ( Chrome console ):
Failed to load https://api.chain.com/v1/bitcoin/addresses/3GXJPPyKrtd7EZFjj6PsZfD13Rq4VCRrzo: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 405.

Now, I got someone to edit the script for me and they changed the chain.com API to chain.so API. With the original one, I couldn’t get past Step 4 in the recovery app - it just fetched infinitely; with the modified one, it gets to Step 5 but the only issue is that the script says the Balance is 0 BTC. Which isn’t real, according to my addresses page and the wallet history. I guess the problem might be the script can’t fetch the data properly OR the data is faulty?

So...I’m in need of help/advice? If someone can get this stuff sorted out I am willing to give 0.4 BTC out of the final amount. Thanks!

**Bitcoin and me (Hal Finney)** 

Copied from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

I have some Lord of the Rings memorabilia that I want to sell.  I know someone in Greece that is interested in buying them, but he wants to pay me with bitcoin.  Now, I know what bitcoin is, but I've never used it before.  Can someone tell me the idiot's guide to setting up a wallet and having the bitcoin transferred to me without being scammed?  I've heard stories of people using paypal to buy stuff from people online, then having the money yanked back once they receive the item.  Can that happen with a bitcoin wallet?  Also, how easy it to turn the bitcoin into actual cash.  I'm thinking of cashing out half of it and keeping the other half in bitcoin form just to see what happens to it."

72,"I was at a meetup recently titled 'Blockchain and Cryptocurrency for beginners' that had a focus on Bitcoin. A lot of people were finding it hard to wrap their heads around the tech involved particularly blockchain, to be honest I have not met a person that has 'got it' the first time they were introduced to the idea. 

Like email we don't need to know how an email works for it to benefit our lives so I started to think of what the USP's (Unique selling points) of Bitcoin are, how it will appeal to people and gain more mainstream adoption.

These are what I came up with;

**A store of Value**

**You're in control of your own money**, no one can peer into you account or impose tax levies 

**No boarders for transfers**

**No signup process, like a bank** 

**Access you funds worldwide once you have access to the internet**

**Decentralised, no central point of attack or downtime** (as an example, Instagram went down a number of weeks ago because Amazom web servers went down and no one could use their app)"

75,"It been a few month now that everyone is trying to find reasons to the huge decline of bitcoin, even blaming the moon or corrupted cartel.
Although I really believe that the market is very manipulated by whales and that state actors protect their intertest (like we would do) and want to tame bitcoin as it is an alternative to gold which became almost 100% state owned after 1971 to suppress people's power to sovreignty. The cultural and religious calendar of people around the world certainly affect the market. And Mt Gox sell has surely something to do with the correction.
But a few weeks ago some banks, when the dow jones took its hugest it since 6 years, had margin positions instantaneously closed with billions of net losses. Now as I cannot give sources on this you have to believe me.
What I can tell you is that my first reflex when the crypto market started to trumble, was to cash out alts to consolidate my long btc margin positions. Took a huge loss on this but anyway. I truely believe that mixed traders, wall street and bitcoin, liquidated bitcoin to prepare the stock crises ahead. 
We wanted to know what would happen to bitcoin, now that it is a real market, if wall street crash. If my analysis are correct we can assume that bitcoin crashes before wall street and that bitcoin crash is a signal for wall street turning bearish. 
I hope that this lowering of the price + the huge bullish news related to the Lightning Network and Segwit will consolidate and increase the adoption among people and not speculator, which would in the long run turn bitcoin into a safe financial space and not the speculators far west as it is now. 
If wall street actually collapse, we could see bitcoin going way lower than expected, but I don't think that mc afees predictions are absolutely unrealistic. Especially if the hashpower continues to rise. So keep hodling, trying to outsmart the market now is very dangerous, if you are not a pro trader :p"
76,"I just want to say as a Venezuelan that Bitcoin has been godsend, enabling me and many other Venezuelans ex-pats to send money comfortably to our families. Before Bitcoin, eluding the currency control of the government (more like theft scheme) was usually done by sending money to an american account (which made it troublesome for those in europe) and haggling (so much haggling with people who would give 10-20% less than what was shown at dolartoday). The best part is that localbitcoin is an actual free market, so no more haggling. Bitcoin cash usually tries to lure venezuelans with tips, but simply put localbitcoin's liquidity is absolute king. Localethereum has low liquidity which translates into noncompetitive prices even when the fees of Bitcoin were around 50$ per transaction. Localbitcoincash.org has not a single offer (I actually would like some competition) so BCH must be swapped for BTC in order to access BsF (there are other ways such as AirTM but fees are ridiculous). 

I feel the weekly volume will continue rising, sadly as more and more Venezuelans leave the country and send remittances to their families. I am always trying my best to teach other expats to use bitcoins as it is the current superior way to send money, of course this may change in the future, but right now, Bitcoin has become an essential tool to a great number of Venezuelans. "
77,"Now that Facebook is facing pressure on privacy, is it a possible use case for a decentralized ""Instagram"" Lightning network app to sit on top of Bitcoin where members pay a negligible amount like a one time fee of 5cents to be a member then have an option for members to sell private pictures or artistic photos or videos, or is this just not applicable to this particular cryptocurrency/layer?"
78,"After having a 30 min phone call I had to cancel my current debit card because they deemed my card compromised after a coinbase purchase. Prior to today I had purchased bitcoin on coinbase 15 times and had no issues. The woman kept saying it’s because of the amount and time of purchase but neither answer made sense so I addressed the stipulations of the event and yet she couldn’t give me solid reasons for their reactions. I am now without a card for the moment and won’t be able to purchase bitcoin while at this low. 
I’m just putting this out there so people know there is a possibility of this happening to them. "

Not even really a tinfoil hat but this seems artificial maybe this entire space has been.  No one is complaining we are all just watching by while scratching our heads.  I can simply believe, its just more people are selling than buying but why today.  I guess I'll get to finish my coin up cheap at this rate and just hide it for a few years.   "

87,"Have been playing with Bitmex testnet and leverage. Was hoping to take advantage of BTC swings to test/figure it out. Couple questions:

- Does Bitmex testnet even work? It doesn’t seem to calculate or store and profits or losses? PNL and account balances don’t update for winning and losing trades, so is still a mystery...

- Whats the point of leveraging a trade 2 - 100X and risking liquidation if real ROI is still only based on what you put in? Just use your normal exchange, sell high, buy back lower.

The only informative pages online are Bitmex itself and affiliates (blogs getting commission for signing up new members).

88,"So I'm thinking. There's a limited amount of BTC available.

People hodling BTC may hold for so long that they unfortunately pass before exchanging/using it. What happens to it? 

If said person was holding gold that gold would fall into possession of next of kin or the bank or whoever clears the house or the bank after your lease on a safety deposit box runs out. But generally somebody will take ownership of said gold with it being a physical thing. 

Cold storage could be redeemed by somebody who understands it. But any kind of digital wallets would be in purgatory forever meaning even less BTC on the market right?

A lot of the current whales missed that last
Bull run, they know it’s a matter of time until crypto is adopted on a large scale,they ultimately as of now don’t care about the price, the only mission these people have is controlling the market. Unlike fiat currency which has an endless supply, bitcoin doesn’t.They’re essentially getting weak hands to sell to increase their supply for future control.

They’re the big dogs of pump dumps. Leave in the comments why you think these drops are happening."

107,"Maybe this has been discussed many times already but I still don't get the point: Given the idea that BTC should work as a currency, why do some of you want it to gain incredible value in very short time, and why do you think it's necessary to hold lots of BTC forever? To me, this seems to be not only two different targets, but also contradictory ones. In the fiat world, you would use a currency with a very precise gut feeling about its value looking at the goods you can buy for it, and you have lots of sources of information to see its (necessarily rather stable) precise value when comparing to other currencies. You would hold it only for the reason of being able to pay something immediately, and to keep your fortune when there is no better option at the moment. Whereas, when you want something which gains value over time, you would use shares, or houses, or rare old cars. Since I appreciate so much the underlying technology of BTC, it would be worth to see it really adopted by the public but it won't, given an average value change of 20 percent per day!

I understand that one of the essential targets of BTC is, that it must never be controlled by any institution. But, and this is what I am really convinced of, you must get rid of the soaring and the crashing, and of the daily 20 percent ups and downs.

The key question is, wouldn't it be possible to get an algorithmic solution for that stability issue?

The BTC community obviously has a lot of super brains. After the brilliant idea of implementing the LN, I think the next big thing you need to tackle is exactly this: get the BTC value stabilized by algorithms. Surely it must gain value over time when the community grows, due to the limited amount of bitcoins, but this process must be steady, foreseeable and without surprises. After you have managed that, I believe you will see lots of people adopt it as a means of payment instead of gambling, and these will then be lots and lots people who are not inside the technology but who are just using it for all the advantages it has. Smartphones are used all the time by billions of people because they are so terribly convenient, but how many of them know all the technology? It doesn't matter to them because it works anyway. I think a technology is mature enough for the really big world when a standard user doesn't need to know anymore how it works. The ""user experience"" of using BTC for payment must just ""it's working always and everywhere"", and the next key success factor is a very reliable stability of its value. 

Unless you want to keep it as something to gamble with, like betting on sports results or dealing with penny stocks. Of course the winners of this game will be at least millionaires at the end, but millionaires in fiat money, and this still ongoing gambling game will not cause any progress on the original idea of crypto currency.

TL;DR
BTC cannot work as a currency when it stays as volatile as it is. BTC brains you need to look for and implement an algorithm which stabilizes the BTC course against fiat money. "

128,"Lightning software is just beginning but mainnet progress has come quite far already! I wanted to introduce my node which I'm excited about and will continually be working on.

Skyrus is a dedicated node to provide liquidity and other lightning payment tools. Now with a mainnet wallet released, you can begin establishing real payment channels to nodes on the network such as mine. Here is a simple guide to begin creating channels to Skyrus via eclair:

First you will need to fund the wallet like any other bitcoin wallet.

1. Swipe to the leftmost tab in Eclair (""Your Bitcoin Address"")
2. There you can see the bitcoin address and can fund it in all of the familiar ways

Once a payment is confirmed, now you can begin creating channels:

1. Visit [skyrus.net](https://skyrus.net) to find the node URI
2. In Eclair, swipe to the rightmost tab (""Lightning Channels"")
3. Press ""Scan a Node URI"" and scan the QR code on the site.
4. Type in the channel capacity you would like to fund with. (All lightning software is new and you should be careful not to fund too much!!)

Once the channel funding transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you can begin making micropayments. Channels you open with Skyrus will be long lasting as the node will be in service indefinitely and I work hard to keep it smooth sailing. This means you will be able to make very cheap payments even in times of high bitcoin onchain fees.

Of course feel free to ask me for any other questions regarding the node or other lightning network questions in general. :D"

131,"As recent days have clearly shown for the *n*th time, stocks are far too volatile to use as a store of value. Even solid companies' stocks will crash in the face of bad news that doesn't directly affect them. Stocks can be diluted at will by a board of directors and insiders get preferred terms for them without transparency. Fraud is rampant and companies go bankrupt because of it even as management enriches itself. And the stocks have no intrinsic value -- today they are just notations in an electronic database. I think that fewer and fewer people will be willing to risk substantial funds in them.

137,"Hi. I am so sick of losing money. Ive been putting all my savings in diverse portfolio since I joined on January 7th. But it seems no matter how much I am putting, whether I buy the dips I keep losing all my money. This sucks that all my friends are investing and get rewarded for it. However my hard earned money go to feed a whale that fixed technical analysis and used his bots to make sure all my stop losses are hit. Well I dont have any bots and I want to play fair. How does a non-whale survive in this crypto market. Ive made 6 seperate large deposits since January 7th, 1 being as recent as last week. Not 1 deposit even managed to stay above 10 percent loss. MY family whos been in stocks all their life doesnt even want to believe and thinks that its possible for such huge volotility without heavy manipulation. So how do I survive in this market? Is this market even for regular joes or is it a war of the rich with us being used as pawns paying for all whales fees and expenses?"
138,"Hello, friends. 

I finally got access to Robinhood, so I’ll try to list the pros and cons of each and then it’d be great to hear some community feedback as well. They both offer streamlined apps, instant deposits/trades, and no commission fees. Pricing data is below, along with what the “fees” would work out to be when compared to actual market values. 

But first though, I’d like to address all the people calling these apps “scams” because you can’t withdraw your crypto to a wallet or have access to the private keys. Yet. I guess the question I’d ask is how distrusting of entities do you want to be. Admittedly, I didn’t lose anything when Mt. Gox was hacked. Or Parity, or any other exchange. So I don’t have the paranoia that many in the community have over losing their crypto. But I’ve determined that as a simple investor, I have zero use for having that kind of direct control over keys or coins. I’m ok with someone else holding them, and from what I understand both companies utilize cold storage to some degree, as well as other security protocols. Also their commission-free trading, although slightly above market price, is nothing to scoff at. Neither are their instant deposits and instant trades. If I REALLY want to transfer to an external wallet in the future, I’ll just sell for fiat and do it through another exchange. Hopefully by then both companies will have an option to do that in the app. 

Robinhood’s announcement about offering crypto was honestly what got me serious about investing. Up to that point I didn’t like exchanges in their current state, especially their fees and convoluted verification processes. I’d been strictly a traditional equity investor up until late January when I read their press release, and I finally thought I’d found a platform I could start with. I got on the waiting list immediately, hoping it would be released in February as stated. Wishful thinking, I guess. 

February came and went, and I was angry that I’d checked the app every morning for a month straight for nothing. I was so worried that I’d “miss the moon,” oh boy was I wrong. If I’d just waited until it was released, I actually could’ve saved a lot of money not chasing the dip. 

Anyway, buying experience: once you’ve been onboarded and allowed to trade crypto, it’s as simple as selecting your coin and tapping buy. You’ll be asked to enter an amount, followed by a user agreement and then in my case being told I couldn’t do a market buy and had to do a limit buy. I’m still new to this scene and unclear about the specifics of this, but just be aware that Robinhood specifies market and limit orders and may restrict which you can use, depending on how much you’re investing. I’d say overall it was a painless transaction and I started tracking my holding immediately. Graphs can be manipulated to show specific prices at certain times, and I’m sure many will appreciate the market vs limit order options. 

Circle Invest became available mid-March, and I was ecstatic about it because of my fury over Robinhood’s betrayal. If Robinhood is supposed to be a bare-bones exchange, Circle is just a bone. It’s extremely basic, doesn’t allow limit orders and its “graphs” aren’t useful for anything besides looking at the squiggly line and saying hmmm, that looks bearish. Having said that, onboarding could not have been faster or easier, and I was hodling coins less than 5 minutes after I downloaded it. 

Circle allows for $10,000 of instant deposits from your bank a week, vs Robinhood’s $1,000 a day. Circle’s prices are also higher than Robinhood’s. At the time of writing here are their prices and fees compared to the independent BitcoinAverage, which were recorded as simultaneously as possible: 

BitcoinAverage BTC price: 6778.55

Robinhood Crypto BTC list price: 6774.94
RC BTC buy price: 6784.81 (.0009% fee)
RC BTC sell price: 6761.09 (.0026% fee) 
Total fee: .0035%

Circle Invest BTC list price: 6842.52
CI BTC buy price: 6842.52 (.0094% fee)
CI BTC sell price: 6700.89 (.0116% fee) 
Total fee: .021% 

BitcoinAverage ETH price: 376.71

RC ETH list price: 377.20
RC ETH buy price: 377.86 (.0031% fee)
RC ETH sell price: 376.63 (.0002% fee)
Total fee: .0033% 

CI ETH list price: 381.31 
CI ETH buy price: 381.31 (.0122% fee) 
CI ETH sell price: 373.74 (.0079% fee)
Total fee: .0201% 

According to my recorded data, Robinhood truly has lower fees than anyone else on the market. Period. Feel free to replicate my results if they seem disingenuous, although bear in mind it’s a tad difficult to capture numbers from 3 sources simultaneously. 

Note: the first attempt to compile these numbers was cut short when I realized Circle Invest had blocked me from depositing fiat and buying/selling crypto due to my account being “under review.” From what I could tell even though they’d confirmed a withdrawal from my bank, they never actually did it and therefore I was trading with imaginary money that they didn’t actually have access to. Not my fault, clearly system error, but they locked my account. Maybe I’d been making too many buys in a short time for their taste and they wanted to check me out, but this process took much longer than expected and I wasn’t able to trade or withdraw from March 28th until April 5th, until someone finally “manually reviewed” my account after I complained. Definitely an annoyance. 

So what has your experience been with either of these platforms? Which do you prefer? Which do you think people should use? How do their prices match up with your exchange of choice? Do you think they’re both stupid because you don’t control the private keys and don’t trust anyone? Fire away! I think once these platforms release more coins and allow for wallet transfers both in and out, we have a couple winners on our hands.

I have had this idea for a while now, so I'm finally working on it, currently the features are:

1) Add pairs from 4 different exchanges (Bitfinx, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Binance)

2) Alerts you on price above/below constantly unless u stop it

3) Price percentage change difference, this one usually is helpful when price suddenly goes up or falls, lets say we select btcusd pair and set Refresh Every to 100 secs and 1% price change, if it has increased or decreased 1% from last price in 100 seconds, it will alert u, usually helpful for an incoming pump or dump

4) If alarm is not important, we can just chill and see all prices in one screen refreshing every single second too

Suggestions are welcome

Firstly, this is my brother and he is so excited: http://i.imgur.com/OK52ErQ.jpg

I am a student in university and I have invested in bitcoin and other altcoins a big amount of money that I earned from another job. Because I am broke af for now (I have to pay a monthly loan that my family has), I borrowed my little brother 2.5$ to get out when I returned to my city of born. (my parents were not at home)

So, he was asking me for the money some days later and I proposed to send him 10$ in ""computer cash"". I told him that he would be able to access them some years later and it could have a much higher value.

He was so excited and he is asking me to give him bitcoins instead of his coins.

From now on, I will send as much bitcoins as I can for his future. Maybe I give him access to the wallet when he will be 16 years or older.

It is time for me to start teaching him about internet, bitcoin and the blockchain. It can be hard, but I would be happy if someone taught me about bitcoin when I was playing counter-strike 1.6 24/7.

172,"Hey all,

Friend is requesting help getting access to some BTC he forgot he had.

He used Multbit Classic wallet back in 2013/2014. All he has are a bunch of .wallet files for some reason, his BTC address and a 50-character password labelled ""Bitcoin wallet"" that he found in his password manager (it's not 64 characters so I assume this can't be the private key so I'm not sure if it was used for Multibit - I never used the wallet myself). Tried downloading the multibit classic wallet but says I need to install a legacy version of Java. Will get around to that later but was wondering if there was anything else I could do in the meantime?

Thanks for your help!"

193,"Among such countries as USA, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia and Malta I would also mention Finland. 

""Suomen Pankki"" (SP) (Finland's Central Bank) may be considered a hero role model for other EU financial watchdogs to follow. Not only its officials have been closely monitoring crypto-currencies market for years, gradually deepening their understanding of decentralized digital money environment, but also bank's official statements are remarkably different in its measured and thoughtful tonality from wild, almost maniacal crypto-hunt reports issued by some EU financial institutions.

For example, in January 2014, in the wake of anti-crypto-mania SP published on its web-page the following testimony, which was surreptitiously named ""Bitcoin involves risks"". Sure, as any other government backed, coercive, centralized financial gatekeeper, which job is to preserve the stability of the current fractional reserve monetary system, SP is far from being ""pro-Bitcoin"" in it.

Still, when SP's communique says, for instance - ""Use of Bitcoin does, however, involve risks for the user, and its value vis-a-vis official currencies has fluctuated significantly."" and ""The value of a virtual currency is based on supply and demand only. Authorities or other public bodies are not responsible for the purchasing power or stability of Bitcoin, and it can lose its value."" that sound like reasonable, although, negative statements, which, however, do not try to invoke readers' fear or to speculate on public ignorance.

There's no surprise, then, that Finland today possesses one of the most crypto-friendly legal environment on the planet. Even though Finnish tax authorities fully tax all profits derived from crypto-transactions, virtual currencies are exempt from VAT. Additionally, you are not require to obtain a special banking license or to follow KYC rules in order to run a local crypto-broker. As usual, government's friendly approach to crypto-businesses is gratified by the surge of entrepreneurial activity in the country. For example, Finland, among other big technological companies, already harbors World's biggest P2P Bitcoin exchange.

196,"Even though the lightning network seems super cool solution to scaling, opening and closing payment channels take up space too. Currently with 1mb blocks the main net can handle maybe 7 transactions per second. If we assume a average person does 3 transactions per day, the main net can support about 200k users.

This is speculative at best but with the lightning network bitcoin can support about 50 million users if we assume that average user opens and closes a payment channel two times a year (220 million transactions per year / 4). This feels optimistic too.. So a block size of maybe 200mb + lightning would support 10 billion, which is ridiculous and from what I understand, increasing it compromises the original idea of decentralisation..

So bitcoin is only at beginning of it's journey and these problems don't exist in near future but are there any projects working on further scaling solutions or any ideas about this? Did I do the math right?

200,"**Who would win: The collective governments of the world or Bitcoin?**

People perceive government as an extremely powerful and effective entity, and this is largely true in many aspects.  Government is able to bring tremendous force against many entities to either compel them into submission or even destroy them completely. 

But in order to accurately understand the situation, you need to look deeper.  Governments are very good at bringing compelling or destructive force against centralized entities.  Corporations, organizations, specific individuals, and other governments are all entities that have reason to fear governments based on past evidence.

But what are some areas government is not so good at, or even areas they are exceptionally weak in?

Governments seem to have a rather big problem attacking things that do not have a centralized point to target.  The illegal drug market is one such example, certain terrorists organizations are another.  Perhaps even the Vietnam War is a display of the difficulties a powerful government has with attacking a distributed or non-centralized entity.

Governments also seem to have great difficulty knowing how to responding to disruptive change preemptively or even in a timely manner **with the appropriate counter response**.  Instead governments seem to respond after a threat becomes clear and does so with a response that is inadequate or even does more damage to itself than doing nothing at all.  The government response to 9/11 is a good example of this, with the creation of the TSA which costs that same government over $7 billion/yr. 

Also, government just seems to operate in a horribly inefficient manner generally.  An entity that creates [sinkholes of bureaucracy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2014/03/22/sinkhole-of-bureaucracy/) is especially ill equipped to conserve, adjust, and survive when resources are constrained or more generally to execute an effective counter strategy efficiently.

We also know that government gets a great deal of its funding through [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage), which would quickly be cut off as a revenue source if the dollar were to lose value.  If this were to occur, it would put the government in a situation where it's resources are cut off at the very moment they need additional resources to counter attack the monetary threat.

These are all ominous factors for the governments of the world when this inevitable confrontation with Bitcoin finally occurs, but I think there is another perhaps even greater factor that will tilt the scales to the point we can know the outcome of this conflict before it occurs. 

When Ross Ulbricht was arrested in a public library it seemed like a great victory for government and a display of their ability to strike decentralized targets (although this was only possible because of Ross' poor OpSec).  But in the wake of this arrest, I think we see some very worrying signs for the fate of government.  THREE of the agents (Carl Mark Force IV, Shaun Bridges, and a DEA Agent) that were a part of this investigation were charged with criminal activity relating to their efforts to enrich themselves with some of the seized bitcoins.  These agencies are not the local corrupt police force, but rather the FBI, Secret Service, and DEA--why would THREE professional and highly-trained agents switch sides and effectively go from acting on behave their government overloards to rabidly and greedily acting in their own individual interest.  I would suggest this is because of Bitcoin.  When you have a drug bust, generally speaking, most (maybe) of the cash and drugs makes it way through the evidence chain without individual actors siphoning off too much, but with Bitcoin there is no need to launder the cash or sell the drugs, it is just super easy to conceal with much lower risk for the agents getting caught (though not quite low enough for Carl Mark Force IV, it would seem).  In any case, Bitcoin seems to have a mysterious power to pull government actors away by tempting them to act in their own self interest.  In short, [Bitcoin lures government agents into defecting and switching sides to Bitcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoins-shroud-of-subtlety-and-allure/)

**So what do we expect will happen?**

As Bitcoin grows in size governments will eventually move to attack or kill it.  They will take this action too late (it's already too late), their action will be ineffective, and their response will eat up their dwindling resources in a time when their revenue stream is being squeezed by the bitcoin-induced fiat devaluation.  Among those government uses to lead and implement its response, many of those actors will defect and switch sides to Bitcoin perhaps like how King Louis the XVII kept sending waves of soldiers to arrest Napoleon who had escaped Elba until Napoleon sent him word ""please send no more troops, I have enough"".

I see Bitcoin vs Governements of the world as a quintessential David vs Goliath event.  But like David vs Goliath, if you had looked past the surface and understood the situation correctly, you would have known [Goliath was dead the moment David stepped onto the battlefield.](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=243294593)"

203,"Hey everyone! You might remember me from some of my other recent cryptocurrency articles, like my responses to certain anti-Bitcoin diatribes posted on Forbes. This time I'm back with something a little different: a response to a common, modern argument against Bitcoin. In this case I've used a recently-published Marketwatch article as a sort of metric, but the guy who wrote this is by no means alone in making this argument. The argument is this: if Bitcoin's price goes down enough, miners will abandon the coin and it will become worthless overnight because no one will be facilitating transactions.

Basically, I got tired of seeing this everywhere, and I thought it would be useful to explore all the technical and social reasons why it's wrong. For what it's worth, I *don't* think the article I'm responding to is clickbait - at least, not egregious clickbait. I just think the guy happens to be wrong.

206,"""Ask not what Bitcoin can do for you, ask what you can do for Bitcoin.""  –  John F. KenNODEy

I've slowly started to fall down the rabbit hole with Bitcoin.  I bought my first coin in early 2017, and since then, I have slowly poured a decent portion of my discretionary income into it as well as read most of the books on the subject.  I get it – I have a solid understanding of how it all works and how disruptive it will be.

However, I work in finance and would not consider myself great with technology.  I'm not going to learn how to code, I'm never going to be contributing to the open source code, and I'm not quitting my job to work for Coinbase or some crypto fund.  Aside from spreading the good word, I wish I could do something to help accelerate Bitcoin's growth besides laying on my couch refreshing my Blockfolio app 25x a day.

After reading ""Mastering Bitcoin"", I started to look into full nodes and why anybody would even want to run one of these things.  Here is a good article I found on ""6 Reasons to Run Bitcoin Full Node"":  [http://bitcoinist.com/6\-reasons\-run\-bitcoin\-full\-node/](http://bitcoinist.com/6-reasons-run-bitcoin-full-node/).

Here are the cliff notes:

1. Helps strengthen the network
2. You can set up a more trustworthy wallet on it
3. You can vote if a hard fork comes
4. Higher degree of privacy
5. It's not that hard
6. It's not that expensive.

I found the Bitseed 3 through some research:  [https://bitseed.org/product/bitseed\-3/](https://bitseed.org/product/bitseed-3/).  I was looking for a plug\-n\-play model where I could pay some money, plug it in, and be done with it.  It cost $359 in total.  I know most people are able to run a full node at a cheaper cost, but not being tech\-savvy, I needed something easy and ready to go.  I read a few articles and watched some videos and was able to plug it into my AT&amp;T router and open the 8333 port.  This is not a Bitseed commercial, I am sure there are other solid products out there as well.

So far, it's been great, and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I'd add on a few more reasons to run a full node:

7.  Relative to the amount of $ I have invested in Bitcoin, $359 is a small price to do my part to support the network.  For the general population, it is probably one of the best ways we can help.

8.  It will help you better understand Bitcoin.  To really see it happen \(block height, connecting to other nodes, propagating transactions across the network, etc.\), you get a better perspective of how things really work under the hood.

9.  Supposedly, it helps lightning network, as a stronger/bigger infrastructure can help support more/quicker transactions on the lightning layer.

9.  More nodes for BTC sticks it to BCH. \(suck it\)

10.  Its cool to rep the brand.  I put a Bitcoin sticker on the device, and it's a great conversation starter.  I see it like repping your favorite sports team memorabilia in your room.

You to girl at bar: ""Yo, wanna come check out my full node?""

Girl: ""mmmmmyaaaa like sureeeeee""

You:  ""Tight.  I can show you my Bitseed 3, too.""

Bitcoin is the future.  Hopefully everybody can find a way to do his/her part to support its growth.  Peace, love, &amp; BTC. "

208,"BTC Jam ended up being a massive scam.   At first I thought it was acting a bit weird, then I looked in detail at my account.         

BTCJam closed last year suddenly.   What was alarming, is the amount of defaulted loans I had been awarded, nearly every Bitcoin i lent on the site went unpaid back.  That is fine, I understand that might happen, but then it got greasier.      

I looked into the arbitration notices I was awarded -  Arbitration notices from a ""lawyer firm"" saying the debtor owes the creditor.  Well, that is where they used a fake law firm, a law firm that doesn't exist at all.  It's completely fake and the arbitration notices are completely useless.    

Then I looked back at what I was owed.  The account shows 3 important things - AMOUNT LENT, AMOUNT PAID, REMAINING BALANCE.  A simple equation.  Well to my alarm, the amount lent wouldn't line up with ANY of the remaining balances or the amount paid - BTCJam was spoofing these numbers to say that far more of the loan was paid off then actually was.        

I am not sure what to do but this seems  like a pretty big case of fraud IMO.   I understand the risks of using a Bitcoin lending platform, but it's completely different if a few users are defaulting compared to if the website was created to cheat people out of money with a fraudulent front.  And BTCJam was clearly involved with taking out money.

The transactions from the paying addresses went to a couple of random addresses and this went on for 4-5 times. An example with non factual numbers: thief address received 210BTC from payments from ransomware. He send 190 to address 1. Address 1 send 160 to address 2 and a bunch to various others. Address 2 did the same with a smaller amount to address 3 etc. 

So each of these addresses had eventually the same address that received huge chunks. They had transactions inbetween with other addresses that had transactions with the first main addresses. 

All this confusing address BTC exchanges isn't related but it led me to a particular address that keeps exchanging BTC back and forth with the same address. I am talking about 100s of BTC's. Is this like a method for people to do? Or a strategy? I couldn't find anything about why someone would want to transfer BTC x from A to B to A to B to A to B to infinity. So my first question would be, why do this? Doesn't each exchange cost a small bit of BTC, making the address lose money? 

Looking down on the exchange numbers I scrolled down since I was simply baffled by the amount worth of BTC that was going around in these trades. Like converted... I'd probably never see that amount of money in my entire existence. But then I encountered an even weirder exchange. And I might not understand this fully but this particular address was sending BTC back to his own address as well? Like A sends to A and B to A and B, to A and B. And in between it received from like 100+ addresses a total of 800+ BTC which goes through the same routine AB -&gt; AB -&gt; AB etc. Why would a method like this be used? 

Look I am not looking to gain anything or so, I am simply just curious, going by the irregular timestamps it doesn't seem to be automated either. Isn't this extremely tedious? 

The crazy A -&gt; AB -&gt; AB address in question is https://blockchain.info/address/1EEqRvnS7XqMoXDcaGL7bLS3hzZi1qUZm1
The other address that was linked to my research is https://blockchain.info/en/address/3JjPf13Rd8g6WAyvg8yiPnrsdjJt1NP4FC?offset=150&amp;filter=6

I am not interested in my research, but simply in their behaviour. The research part was simply a backstory as of how stumbled accross this.

217,"Sorry if this has been answered already... I  have been downloading the blockchain at a friends house all weekend, it is 77% complete, but I am getting ready to head home. I have read that it is okay to pause the download and resume it later. Would it be safe to pause the download, and resume it later on a different internet connection?

218,"So I'm sitting here trying to figure out what the hell I'm going to do for taxes (yes I realize its really fucking late for me to be doing this) but forms 1099-B, 8949 and 1040-D all require an itemized list of transations as if I have stocks. 

Buy 1 stock of X, gains and then sell price and so on. 
But we never buy 1 bitcoin and sell 1 bitcoin its 

.1197 bitcoin bought here, sold .023 bitcoin there, and the market was way over there at that point, so what the hell am I supposed to do for a tax form thats built for old style investments? Do I just aggregate them all on the original date and then the date I sold them? 

"
219,"... if Satoshi waited until mass adoption and then distributed his/hers/theirs bitcoins to the poor? I actually haven't thought about how to identify ALL 'the poor people', but clear demographics that live on very bad conditions exist today, so at least they (actually a very big % of the global population) could certainly get a piece. 

I think it would be very beautiful and the most moving culmination for bitcoin's history. 

I have read (haven't really made much digging about it) that Satoshi could own 1 mil BTC. Thats 4% of the total number of bitcoins to ever be mined, so perhaps it won't make THAT much of a difference, but it still would help a lot of people. Perhaps even some/most of the bitcoin whales start sharing their fortunes too...

220,"Hey everyone, I am super new to bitcoin and to be honest am not sure what I'm doing. I needed to buy something via bitcoin, and its recommendation was to download Bitcoin Core Wallet, so I did that and bought bitcoin to the receiving address on there, however I didn't know how much space was needed. So now I have sent the money to the address, but the wallet is trying to sync (and its taking forever which apparently is normal) and I'm not even sure my computer has enough space for it all. I read that I should try to transfer it over to Electrum, so I have that downloaded. I tried doing the Sweep Keys thing, but every time I try it, it says ""no inputs found (note that input needs to be confirmed)""

“Unfortunately Russia is not yet a GDAX-supported country. Users from Coinbase buy/sell-supported countries are currently able to access GDAX (https://www.coinbase.com/global). We keep this list up to date if you’d like to check back in the future as we’re always working hard to expand into new countries.

If you were to attempt to log into your GDAX account from an unsupported country such as Russia, your account would be temporary locked until you were able to verify that you were back in one of the supported countries.

We can only support countries where we have met the necessary regulations to operate. We are working hard to add support for more countries but we don’t have an estimated time for when new countries may be added.

Please keep in mind you can still use your Coinbase account as a hosted digital currency wallet to receive, store, and send funds.”

I’m wondering if I use VPN could I still trade on gdax from Russia without a problem? May be someone has experience in trading on gdax while being in one of the unsupported country? Also if I live in Russia do I still have to pay tax to an American government if I use gdax? I believe they would report any gains to the IRS. Thanks 🙏🏻 "
225,"In mid-2017 my siblings and I wanted to invest $50k into crypto through coinbase, which we did. Problem is we did it in a rush and only through my Coinbase/Gdax account since it was the account with the highest buying limit, because it was the oldest account. When they opened accounts it wouldn't let them buy any decent amount at once, a couple hundred each time, while mine had a several thousand limit (I bought some coins in 2015, plus fiddled in trading a bit in early 2017, so my limit was higher)

My question is, we want to seperate into our own Trezor wallets, but the record for buying these coins is all in my name legally. How do we legally change them to their names without resetting the Capital gains long term short term clock? Is it possible?

I'm afraid the only option may be for me to just sell their portion, and transfer the money to their coinbase accounts, for them to rebuy it in their names. But that would leave them having to wait another year for the capital gains long term rate to kick in if they sell.

After reading this article I was slightly enraged at the audacity of Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken. He made comments calling the office of AG Eric Schneiderman entitled, disrespectful, hostile and a waste of his time. This aggressive and overly defensive comment comes at an especially interesting time, considering Kraken's terrible customer service, which is openly criticized by thousands of people all over the world wide web. 
I have personally experienced this total disregard for customers and transparency first hand. Kraken seems to operate to a law of their own. From openly being disrespectful to costumer messages, to now denying and not recognizing what would give customers the very security that they are repeatedly asking for. 
Whether or not filling out the questionnaire for the AG is too much to ask or what their intentions are aside, I find it hypocritical of someone in charge of such bad costumer service to criticize anyone.  It is the actions of badly run exchanges that fuel regulators to come in and take heavy-handed actions. 
Just for disclosure: Kraken has been holding my 10k sent to a wrong address after a fork. Costumer service was basically rude, gave me absolutely no timeline on when I would get my money back and this is when they still answered support tickets. I haven't heard from them in months.

If you don't know what rsk is a bitcoin sidechain. RSK achieves 100-300 transactions per second on chain and confirms most payments in less than 20 seconds, while leveraging Bitcoin's proof of work security(merged mining).
Rootstock uses the DECOR + GHOST protocol to reduce the block interval to an average of 10 seconds, which is lower than the current Ethereum block with an average block interval of 16 seconds.
With the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP), RSK will be able to process up to 2000 tps on chain! Source: wikipedia

We have a problem with making the mass understand why bitcoin is financially abordable for every individual.

People want to solve it by introducing the BIT or the FINEY or the SATOSHI... but honestly it only introduce more confusion and only talks to people deep into btc.

I remember in the beginnings where you would mine a block and obtain 200 bitcoins...  
It felt real, it felt abundant, it felt like we were rich.

Nowadays, someone owning 0.645381 bitcoin could consider himself one lucky man, and that sounds ridiculous. 

In order to make it sounds richer, we should call it 645 bit... But who does that anyway ?

MY POINT IS... Why dont we change the unit of the bitcoin? Nobody wants to buy 0.645 bitcoin for 5K $...
But DAMN it sounds right to buy 645 bitcoins !!!

Seriously, let’s just assume 1 BTC is 1000 Bitcoin !!! 

Everybody looks rich, 
Newcomer will sounds more interested,
1 Bitcoin would value around 8$ which looks like a really FAIR and COMMERCIAL price !!!

Disclaimer: Honestly, I don’t want to sound like one of the BCH marketing guy who wants to get rich quick, I have engineering background.

261,"Hey folks,

Without delving into the shitstorm of hell that my life became on April 10th, my brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack 10 days ago; he was 49 and this just should not have happened. 

Despite my being knee-deep in grief at the moment, I'm also likely going to be in charge of probating his estate; my dude lived  across the country in Colorado and had a home, a couple vehicles etc. that needs to be dealt with. He also owned a small amount of Bitcoin as well as two alts, all of which he was managing via the Breadwallet iPhone app.

Ideally, I would like to either transfer his BTC/alts to my wallet or (perhaps better for probating the estate) just gain access to his wallet and keep his balance as is. Even though he only had a small amount of cryptos, we were both really into it in recent months and I know for a fact that he would want to HODL rather than cash things out (I wish he was around to see the recent uptick). 

I have his phone, but his 14-word key is very likely hidden in some box at his house out in Colorado. We talked briefly about it when I went out to visit him in February but just changed the subject because again, this was not supposed to happen. I'm assuming my first step is going out there and digging for that, but I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on what the best course of action here would be. "
262," I've been following BTC and the cryptocurrency graphs, markets and news more closely for a couple of months now \- always trying to decide if/when I should buy \- and I'd like to ask a question that I know will probably be unpopular here, but absolutely legitimate.

It is said that BTC will go up a lot more in value as it becomes more widely accepted \(and traditional currencies inflate\) because it is limited in supply. McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \(maybe way more\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \- a couple quite successful among them \- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even ""better"" one \- though ""better"" is relative\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?

So far it seems to me that BTC is \(at least since I started following it \- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\) much more about speculation \(HODL\) than actual usage as payment \- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\+ in value at any moment.

What I'm trying to ask is:

If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?"
263,"When bitcoin skyrockets in value (and it will), they'll know how much you're worth. Sort of like remaining anonymous when you win the lottery. Fly under the radar folks. Fair warning."
264,"Let me preface this by saying I am a long term crypto enthusiast, I got into bitcoin in 2011 and I've accepted it in my own store since 2012. This is in no way concern trolling or me losing perspective after the most recent crash this winter.

I am simply getting more and more sure that we will never see that utopian world where bitcoin is accepted everywhere and even replaces fiat. I don't think it will die either, but I think it will forever remain niche, reserved for the (relatively few) cases it offers tangible benefits such as being simply unable to pay for something in fiat due to restrictions etc.

There are two main reasons. One is that the main differences of bitcoin which many consider benefits, is actually things that most people either don't care about, or that most people would consider disadvantages. Examples are the non-reversibility, and the total control over your own funds. People want a safety net, they want to be able to chargeback money in case of fraud, and they don't want to be responsible for keeping their own funds safe. With bitcoin, if someone forget a password, or get hacked, they can lose all their money. Most people would never want to use such a system. 

You may say that these problems will disappear over time as more user friendly systems are built on top of bitcoin. But then what is the point? If we have a system that uses bitcoin at the lowest level, but is reversible, and won't allow you to control the funds yourself, and charges fees, then why not just use a normal bank with fiat? You may be okay with such a scenario as long as you have the ability to use your own wallet if you want, but that's my point: I don't think they would allow you to do that. Payment processors would only accept payments through these higher level protocols that may be built on bitcoin but is reversible and requires trust and everything that bitcoin tries to not be. I can't see a way to have the advantages and not the disadvantages too.

The second reason is that even if the system evolves beyond my imagination and becomes ubiquitous in a way that also does allow you to keep all the advantages, society won't allow it. Financial freedom, financial privacy and censorship resistance is something that most people are willing to give up in order to fight crime. Even if you disagree, I think the majority don't, and that's why it will be made law. We're already seeing crackdowns with all exchanges requiring you to give up personal information and some blacklisting customers and blocking transactions for various reasons. If crypto grows in popularity and evidence is uncovered that it is in fact being used to finance f.ex terrorism (like it almost definitely will eventually, if it does grow in popularity), then it will only get worse.

266,"I received this in an e-mail newsletter from strategictechinvestor.com



Dear Strategic Tech Investor,

In the special report I sent my paid-up members last week, I showed what it would mean for its price if e-commerce giants like Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) start accepting Bitcoin.

In short, Amazon's acceptance of cryptocurrencies would be a bit step toward the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin - and to a price of $100,000.

(I've figured out how Bitcoin could get there. To get my ""math,"" click here.)

While in that report I predicted that Amazon would start accepting Bitcoin ""soon,"" I didn't predict this...

Amazon just received a patent for a ""streaming data marketplace"" that would allow users, including individuals or online retailers, to receive real-time cryptocurrency transaction data.

Now, this doesn't mean that Amazon's 100 million-plus Prime members can start paying for their books and electronics with Bitcoin... yet.

But it does reveal Amazon foresees a day when its customers will use Bitcoin and other cryptos to make fast, cheap, secure payments"

268,"I've been reading now for roughly 12-14 hours as well as videos ETC. I feel like I understand most but there's few things I'm unsure of/inconsistencies. Trying to become one of you/write a research paper. Perhaps even teach others on this subreddit who might not be too sure either :)!

If you would like to take part and help me it'd be greatly appreciated, mainly because I feel like to many of you this is pure second nature and most sources I find are extremely repetetive/too technical/biased or building on hype/too advanced English as a non-native speaker. 

Mainly looking to get a general understanding rather than perfect technical knowledge etc, one or two simple sentences even if it doesn't accurately portray it would be awesome.

Regarding mining:

* Is the reward strictly dependant on how many hashes you try to break? Let's say 5 identical mining at same performance doing 1 trillion attempts per hour. Is there any form of luck/chance factor? Could a block be opened in 1min or 25min instead of the average 9-11?

* Are the people offering higher fee's to get their transactions made faster automatically picked up by miners or intentionally chosen or by chance? Does the paid fee get evenly distributed?

* Is the maximum transactions limit currently 7 per second?

Halving of coins:

* When the amount of coins is halved in 2020 odds are quite a few miners will stop mining as their revenue is cut in half, would that make the 'bitcoin network' less secure or slow down transactions?

Economical/Technical:

* Doesn't increasing the amount of coins daily have an impact on price of bitcoin?

* Isn't the current rather big fee's and wait times for transactions a noteworthy problem? Is it about prioritizing safety?

* Is it necessary to wait for your transaction to go through 6 blocks? Are there security risks only going through 2?

Other:

* Since the entire blockchain is stored and saved, is it possible to easily go through,find all of Satashi Nakamoto's transactions?

* Is Bitcoin Core or other Full nodes necessary to keep the network functioning? Is Bitcoin Core outdated compared to other alternatives? From what I have read the 200gigs, memory usage etc. Are there risks to having too few full node miners? And do full node miners get any more incentives to use full nodes?

* Does any problems come with GPU's being overtaken by ASIC's, much less nodes, profit much more limited to China/India/Iceland ETC

* What has been the key things in the new patches/releases of the mining protocol since its release?

For other's searching Googling etc few words that can be summarized in less than 2 sentences?

Hash, Nodes, Fork (soft/hard), Market cap

Any single answer to anything would be more than greatly appreciated. I will constantly be continuing my research on the questions I asked above as well for the next week+. If someone would want to "

270,"When you make a deposit to local bitcoins wallet and then sell the bitcoins to another trader does local bitcoins send the same bitcoins you deposited to the buyer or does local bitcoins fund the transaction from the full pool of bitcoins they hold?

I've read around and most people say that Local Bitcoins do not send the same coins you deposit to the buyer. Apparently they send coins from a random pool inside the LBC website. Making it very hard to track the location of the bitcoins on the blockchain after they are sold.

Is this true?"
271,So do you have possibility officialy buy or sell some valuable staff with cryptomoney?
272,"Hello

Several small businesses I frequent only accept payment in cash or cheque because of high transaction fees on credit cards and other forms of payment.  The businesses are totally above board, they charge tax, give receipts etc.  So they aren't cash-only so that they can high income from the government.

This is super annoying to me, because it means I have to withdraw cash from an ATM before I can pay them.  The businesses are rural, so the closest bank/ATM is 10 minutes away.  This means I have to plan on going to the bank before I go to their business.

So as a thought experiment, how could I suggest to them that they start accepting payment in bitcoin via lightning network (raw bitcoin itself would be not acceptable because of transaction fees and because of the 10 minute wait).

What kind of electronics could they set up beside their cash registers to accept payments, and how can they ""plug themselves in"" to the lightning network?  How can they exchange their payment in bitcoin to local currency with minimum effort in order to pay their employees?"
273,"IMHO When people talk of bitcoin, they are using the wrong denomination.

Bitcoins should be thought of as the gold bars (1000g of gold) of crypto currency.  The middle class could/should never own a gold bar, as there are better ways to store wealth (land, stock, etc).

Similarly mBTC's analog would be an ounce of gold.

When thinking about Bitcoin as a currency, bits and satoshi's are the denominations that middle class people will use.

Now, let me hit you with some napkin math on why precisely bits and satoshi's will be what people speak in if/when BTC hits mainstream.

The GDP per capital over the entire world is roughly valued at [$8000USD/year](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/MateNagy.shtml).  This includes the richest of the rich, and poorest of the poor.  By 2030 the worlds population will be 8.5billion people.  Thus we can napkin math and say that the GDP of the world in 2030 might be close to 70trillion dollars. *note: obviously the networth of the entire world is much higher than this, but lets go with GDP per-capita for our maths here*

If Bitcoin becomes the dominant unit of trade by 2030, this means that the 21Million bitcoin will cover the value of that 70trillion USD GDP.  Meaning that a bitcoin would be worth around $3.2M USD.

Obviously, such exchanges are going to be extraordinarily rare.  But what about satoshi's?  A bitcoin worth 3.2M would mean a satoshi is worth 3.2 cents, and thus a bit would be worth 3.2 dollars.

Now THOSE are nice units of value for common trade.  You'll basically be paying 50 satoshi for a candy bar, which isn't an alien value for people to understand.

Of course, it's a huge IF that bitcoin becomes the dominant unit of trade.  Bitcoins will be useless if Quantum computers can crack a private key; Governments will push HARD on cryptocurrency if their fiat (and thus control of the populace) is truly tested; and the current banking system could implement a more trustworthy and cheap method of conducting business **in the eyes of the general population** *(note: I am specifically saying that the banks might trick the normies into believing in a new form of credit card is more trustworthy)*.  I haven't added any of that into my napkin math."

so I started my day off deciding I was going to try to use a bitcoin atm...

I found one, arrived at a coinsourse atm....

first off, there is no instructions on how to use it, or video tutorial at the atm...

secondly it asks for your phone number...

I entered it, then it sends you a confirmation code via text..

I entered the code...

then it says you must set up an account first...

go to their home page to do so on my phone...

they want your name, first and last, phone number....

then they want you to scan your id, front and back, and then take a selfie...

after you scan your id, and send in your selfie, it is supposed to set up an account...

there is no phone number to call for help... only a text number, and an email...

I sent a text at 10:56 am... inquiring about their registration requirements.... I still have not received a response it's now 4:32pm...

I sent them an email, and within a couple of minutes, about 5 mins, they respond.

so here is the frustrating part... 
I was in front of the atm for over two hours trying to meet there requirements to set up an account...

I sent pictures of my id front and back, all of them are clear, legible photos...

none of them were accepted. I kept getting texts saying your account has been set up for id verification...

during the sending pictures, i got logged off multiple times, and had to keep reentering the same info over, and over again... each time having to get a new text code...

in email communication, the person told me they could not scan my barcode on my id.. to keep re taking pictures, and resubmit till I got a verification text, or an accept text.

after five f@cking hours of trying to get my photos accepted, I gave up.

in email, they told me to keep trying, to use a scanner instead of my phone... I used my phone, I took pictures with my friends phone, and I even scanned my id.

I sent in all, of the pictures, over and over again... emailed back and forth multiple times...each time they tell me it's my fault...keep resubmitting till I got an acceptance text...

well I never got an acceptance text...

in email, they said that I should keep trying, thanks for my patience, and they would waive my first fees...when it is sucessfully set up.

I emailed them back and told them they get one star... and I will be giving a bad review on reddit.

this is why they suck!!!!

there is no phone number to talk to a human.

they never texted back.

when technology failed, they should have had someone manually set up an account and verify my id.

they also take 8% per transaction.

f@ck coinsourse for wasting half of my day...

I told them they lost a customer...

tomorrow I will be attempting to buy bitcoin using their competitor in town.

Here it is: ""https://github.com/khaffner/Crypto-Currency-Tools/tree/master/Lightning%20Node"". The important code is in Deploy-Application.ps1, the rest is just the toolkit. Grab the ""Lightning Node"" folder, and run Deploy-Application.exe as administrator. (I know that sounds extremely sketchy, so I fully understand if you do not want to.

I've tested it successfully on a clean Windows 10 1709 x64 virtual machine. Windows 7 and 8.1 (x64) may also work fine if Powershell and dotNET framework is fully updated to the newest version. This assumes your computer does NOT already have Bitcoin Core or Eclair installed. 200GB is currently required. I am new to lightning and do not know if the resulting config is good and secure.

310,"As the title say.

I strongly believe the world is entering into over-extension when it comes to debt and economic activity, for this cycle at least.

There are many reasons for this, but most importantly lower unemployment rate, and interests sharply increase! Every time interest rates has increased sharply markets (traditional markets) have tanked. 2001 and 2008 are good examples of this.

I am only writing this here because I believe that after a long while thinking, the best position to enter into when this cycle ends, is LONG Bitcoin. I do no longer believe that gold will be the best safe haven asset.

Therefore I urge all members of our community to handle their debt levels right now, so you don't have to dip into your holdings to alleviate the pain when interest rates go up 3-4%-points.

As for myself I will pull around 80% of the money I got in the stock markets the next couple months. And then watch Bitcoin closely awaiting entry. But who am I? You probably shouldn't take your advice from a 21 year old soon to be Econ undergraduate. So do your own research!

It will come preloaded with Native Segwit and Legacy and I will try and learn about the Lightning Network as soon as I can and attempt to implement it. I am aiming to make this wallet something that your grandparents can use - I will try and simplify as much as possible and add features like handles so others using Absence Wallet can receive payments without the need for long addresses that can be mistyped and in future after extensive penetration testing and extensive research on encryption methods, I might implement a username and password system instead of the current 12 word system.

Now on to why I am posting - I need a web developer who can design a website where the user can get information and download the platform. **YOU WILL NOT BE PAID**. I am working on this project for free and so is the designer, however that does not mean we will not send you part of the donations we receive if you do a good job.

If you feel like you are the right man for the job, email me at: p0isoN@absencewallet.com.

324,"I've heard the grumbling about coinbase but it was the quickest way for me to get in and I felt a price increase was coming. The other night I was considering selling a little bit but when I went to complete the transaction I noticed the price wasnt what the current value was. I waited and kept checking and every time I went to make a transaction, it adjusted the price in their favor. Right now the price is listed at 9112. If I go to sell, it shows it as 9068.  If I go to buy, it buys it at 9154. I've done this multiple times and every single time it goes in their favor. I called and asked for the end user agreement but haven't had a chance to look over it. Is this an accepted practice?  Is it a case of ""the price you see is what it's market price is, but we're selling you something we own and can set our own price?""  Does anyone have any insight?  Really just wondering if this has been addressed by anyone or am I wasting my time looking into it?"

An example I could think of would be for example arbitrage opportunities due to different prices of the same cryptocurrency at different exchanges. I want to show that a certain inefficiency exists, and then in the discussion provide explanations for why those inefficiencies might exist.
My thesis should consist of analyses on several such inefficiencies. Help would very much appreciated!"

332,"Despite of a relatively high rate of fixed Internet penetration, which reaches to almost fifty percents, as well as the fact that Cape Verde Escudo has been devalued for more than 20% relating to USD in the past decade, local population doesn't seem to be too enthusiastically engaged with crypto-currencies business at all. However, as new class of digital assets continues to grow in popularity with investors around the world, this situation is about to change.

That was inadvertently confirmed by the Banco De Cabo Verde in one of its official ""comunicados"", signed at 29 March 2018 and named ""Alerta Criptomoedas"". This omnipotent one-pager presents itself the usual and all-so-familiar aggregation of anti-Bitcoin invectives. Various phraseologisms like ""transactions with virtual currencies pose a high risk"", ""offer no protection to consumers"" and ""its association with illicit schemes"" are spilled all over it. Notwithstanding, this ""Alerta"" might be as well viewed from an entirely different stand point.

Besides reminding residual investors about the existence of absolutely new, but not yet locally legalized assets class, the Banco's memo also demonstrates that crypto-phenomena has proved itself to be so omnipresent, that it has became nearly impossible to ignore it even for the absent-minded watchdogs living in the most geographically as well as financially remote parts of the world. With that said, however, we must add, that it might, still, be much more preferable for the local crypto-community (if such has ever existed) to stay hidden from the increasingly perceptive radars of the Cape regulators, which previously have never been noticed for a liberality of their views on the financial markets.

334,"All forms of money need to be easily broken down into identical sub units.

To the average person who stumbled across Bitcoin in 2017, the idea of a ""Bitcoin"" didn't make sense. How can I use a currency so expensive that I can't even own ""one""? Why should I buy .01 of a $10,000 Bitcoin?

Most of us understand that Bitcoin can actually be divided into 100,000,000 Satoshi's, making Bitcoin one of the most divisible currencies in the world, while retaining its perfect scarcity. However, most people are just now learning that **YOU CAN BUY A FRACTION OF A BITCOIN**.

But even when they understand that, many people still perceive the price of a single ""Bitcoin"" to be super expensive, as if they missed their chance to buy Bitcoin on the ""ground level"".

When the masses started coming during late 2017, the price of any coin under $1 exploded to the moon, all because people thought they missed out on Bitcoin and wanted the ""next big thing"" \- expecting these coins to potentially reach $10,000 as well.

# Bitcoin -&gt; Bits

Breaking Bitcoin down into Bits is ultimately something we will need to do if we want the world to utilize Bitcoin as a usable \(linguistically\) currency. It makes more sense to buy a beer for 500 bits \($5\), rather than .00005 Bitcoin.

Similar to a stock split, this will give people the confidence to go buy 100 bits, and it will make them feel richer. Nobody likes to say, ""I own a small fraction of a Bitcoin."" They like to say I own 500 \[insert coin here\], or 100 Bits.

A move from Bitcoin to Bits will spark another retail investor rally, and make Bitcoin a more ""speakable"" currency.

# My Plan to Break Bitcoin into ""Bits""

I run a web app: [MoonRekt.com](https://moonrekt.com/) \- a top 100 list/portfolio tracker. Now before you downvote me for shilling my own project \(I'm just a college student contributing to the community\), let me tell you it's 100&amp;#37; free, and I'm using it as a platform to spark the break Bitcoin into ""Bits"" movement. From now on, Moon Rekt will only quote Bitcoin in ""Bits"", and I encourage anyone running other Bitcoin apps/wallets/exchanges to do the same.

**Current Bitcoin Price: $0.0093** \- slightly less than one cent.

We should all start using Platforms that use Bits and also begin speaking in terms of ""Bits"". We need crypto Twitter to get in on this. We need other websites and apps to get on this. We need exchanges to get on this. And we need CNBC to get on this.

The Bitcoin community is what controls Bitcoin, and if we all decide to start pricing Bitcoin in Bits, then the world will listen. Let's put an end to other worthless coins.

Let's start a rally in Bitcoin that will change the way the world views money.

361,"Warren Buffet's endless criticism on Bitcoin is becoming rather boring than relevant. 
In a recent interview with CNBC Mr. Buffet admits he regretted not believing in Amazon years ago, going as far as saying he was too dumb to realise it’s potential. 
Same approach for companies like Google, Xerox, Apple etc..., he didn't want to invest in something he didn't understand. These young talented freshmen had a clear vision but had to fight and persevere as they received little or no institutional fundings, often developing their ideas in their moms' garage. The support initially came from daring entrepreneurs that believed in the potential, even when nothing was proven yet. Countless college graduates indeed jumped on the boat and got very wealthy developing their business around those new technologies, I doubt many elderly people gave it a toss.

With all respect for his successful career and the great insights he had in his era, one could ask if he can still catch up the way society evolves around him. What were his thoughts when social media came up for example? Or imagine telling your grandpa his transistor radio would soon be replaced by a wireless device that plays any music where and whenever he wants 15 years ago.
It’s dissapointing that a man who used to have such great insights is arguing against something that totally surpasses his understanding, with examples of buying a farm. 
I understand people of his age find it difficult to even send a picture but the millennial generation will be perfectly able to integrate digital currencies into their everyday lives and get rid of those annoying pieces of paper and metal coins. Then there's decentralized internet, even those who do believe in it probably cannot imagine the potential yet, but that's another topic.

Oh and the intrinsic value gibberish... Consider other things people invest in like let's say paintings: if they’re into it and have the money, sure, enjoy it, hang it in your mansion or lend it to museums and have everyone applaud you for it, but how many pieces are just bought for exuberant amounts by some Saudi Arabian prince who barely looks at it and locks it in a vault? 
What’s the use of that other than hoping someone else will buy it for more like our friend the oracle says about cryptocurrency, no difference, it’s what you do with it.
Digital currency is here to stay old man.

Bitcoin emerged in 2009 but it took a few years for it to get mainstream attention.  A small portion of the population knew that bitcoin was a currency/asset/unit of account that would evolutionize money.  

Instead of a few people being rich, EVERYBODY could be rich.  The masses did not seem to care in the first decade or so.  They were so lulled into their fiat-induced coma that they succumbed to a life of rising grocery/rent prices every year.  

Eventually however, the masses saw all their cohorts transcending their dependence on big corporations for jobs, big govt for welfare hand-outs, etc.  They too were tired of the top-down imposed poverty of the people.  Once this mindset hit, it did not take long for the entire world's financial system to change overnight.  Fiat plunged, bitcoin mooned.  Everybody learned the value of saving.  Everybody learned the value of each second in life.  Every word they uttered, every movement they made.  Nothing was taken for granted.  Consumerism dropped as people realized the value of their savings would go up as long as they HODLed.  Bitcoin became a savings grace for humanity.  A true gift from God.  "

I know everyone loves to hate Coinbase, and I think this is another reason ... I noticed that when you BUY on Coinbase, not only is the BUY price higher than what is live on GDAX (their back end trading exchange), but they also charge a fee on TOP of that higher price.

However, if you SELL on Coinbase, at the same moment, the SELL price is LESS, and they still charge a fee.

For example, I noticed right now when the price on GDAX is $9250, a BUY BITCOIN price is 9296.  At the SAME time, if I SELL Bitcoin, the SELL price is $9203.  LESS than the BUY price, but also LESS than GDAX.  On both transactions, the Coinbase FEE is about $140.

375,"7 months ago I started my withdraw process from coinbase when the “hype” was real, after 3 months I managed to actually send the funds to my bank, only for Coinbase to lose them on the way. After many CHARGED phone calls (£43.50) and 100 emails im still in the same place I was 3 months ago. I have spoken to my bank and they have told me exactly what to say and what Coinbase need to do to resolve it and Coinbase turned around to me and lied saying they couldn’t give me the correct form. I’m now in need of my withdraw and they haven’t replied in two weeks.

What the fuck can I do?!"

382,"Goldman's announcement that they will be introducing NDFs (Non-deliverable Forwards) for Bitcoin is a really big deal. This type of contract is how major emerging markets currencies are traded by banks and large institutional clients - no underlying currency is ever exchanged, the parties just settle up at the end of the contract in USD based on the price change. This is a big step in the legitimization of bitcoin as a real global currency, and allows for much easier hedging activity for players who want to get involved in the space.
Crucially, this is gigantic for Bitcoin as an actual use case currency, it allows major retailers who want to accept Bitcoin as a payment method to effectively hedge this exposure without all the hassle of physically transferring the Bitcoin as it is received. For example, Amazon could now manage Bitcoin transaction exposure the same way they would Indian Rupees. While businesses could hypothetically accept and manage the risk before, this opens up the possibility of them managing it in the exact same way they do their other EM ccy exposures, which is so much easier from an organizational perspective that is really changes the game."

When stumbling across new websites that trade crypto currencies, you would always ask yourself, are they legit? Of course, it is natural as a human being to doubt any website’s integrity.

Anyway if those are the names that fill the history of your coin you shouldn't be too happy about it. This is why they are trying so hard to overtake the Bitcoin and BTC/XBT brand so that they can use the actual history which would include Satoshi Nakamoto, Hal Finney, and the white paper. 

The history books matter and BCH is absolutely despicable if you look at their main backers. Often times they claim r/Bitcoin as being filled with memes but then they have their same rat salesman wearing and coining this absolute terrible BCH PLS meme.

It claims to be concerned citizen focused on the good of humanity. It wants to even the playing field between the people and the governments of the world by creating a decentralized currency. This currency is given the name.. Bitcoin. The world believes this entity to be a person or persons who are simply trying to protect their anonymity. Satoshi says that in order for Bitcoin to be truly decentralized, an incentive system based on a computational arms race must be put into place so that there will never be a single individual in control of the system. The arms race begins. First CPUs, then GPUs, then custom ASICs are made to snatch up the ever more valuable cryptocurrency. A multitude of cryptocurrencies are born, and with them, new highly advanced computation chips to provide the massive amounts of Proof of Work necessary to sustain the networks. At the same time, man-kind is also on the verge of a revolution in machine learning, and as a result of the huge production capacities that the silicon fabs have upgraded to, they find themselves with the ability to birth ever more powerful and complex chips that they can program to assist humans in their daily lives.

457,"So I got high the other night and rather than being able to sleep I gots to thinking... as mentioned in the tittle its a thought experiment so rather than keeping it all bottled up I thought I would have a thought dump on this subreddit... here goes...

If one of Bitcoins super rich was to try get Venezuela's economy up and running on Bitcoin what would be required, I know there would be loads of technical issues to address but bare with me on this thought train?

I first started to think what is the correct amount of Bitcoin to distribute to the people of Venezuela, this lead me to think about GDP, what is the GDP of the country? $314.1 billion https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/country-data/venezuela-gdp-country-report

What is the GWP? $107 trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product)

What is the country's GDP in relation to the GWP? .28%.

Then I thought what is that amount of the current supply of Bitcoin, 17 million. 

.28% of 17 million, is 47,600 that's a lot of Bitcoin... It amounts to at its current value approx $9000... $428 million.

I checked out what was the largest amounts held in Bitcoin wallets at this address https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html

So if a super rich Bitsy holder was to distribute that amount to the people of Venezuela what would be the consequences? 

I thought that Bitcoin could be distributed to the people through registering at an exchange with proof of address, obviously an address in Venezuela and ID, preferably a Venezuelan passport.

I'm not sure how it would work but it was an interesting thought experiment, to me at least. 

Its estimated that approximately 32,317,075 million people live in the country that would mean everyone would get approximately .00147290 which at its current rate is about $13-14. Maybe extra if you set up a node?

Obviously it could only happen through the generosity of our Lord and Savior Satoshi, maybe it could be on his list of things to do during the seconding coming?

Well thats enough written diarrhea for today. Good night and Satoshi bless.

459,"On the 10th of May around 10 pm UTC the scam site electrum dot com shut down operation of its website (for now at least) posting just a text message.

The message is repeated in the following reddit thread 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ig4bh/electrum_pro_is_not_bitcoin_stealing_malware_as/

Here the supposed ""Lucas Lofgren"" tries to convince the audience his fork does not steal bitcoin. 

However around the same time users start reporting that their Electrum Pro Wallets are being emptied - one example here https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ihe83/just_had_all_my_bitcoin_stolen_from_my_electrum/

Please note - ""Electrum Pro"" is in no way endorsed by the official and well known Electrum software distributed at electrum.org. It's a copy with a backdoor added with evidence urrently pinned in /r/Bitcoin: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8i5wck/decompiling_the_electrum_pro_stealware/

It looks as though ""Electrum Pro"" formerly distributed at electrum dot com has shut down operation for now, stealing funds from all users who were unfortunate to install the scam wallet. Their seed used in the software was uploaded to the website after installation.

Electrum Pro was supposedly distributed by a company called ""Electrum Pro B.V."" but there is no evidence that this company exists. Moreover it's unlikely ""Lucas Lofgren"" is the real name of the operator of electrum dot com. The domain was recently moved to a Malaysian domain registrar and is using a privacy shield on the whois data to conceal the legal owner.

461,"Today we walked into a Banner Bank with the hopes of opening up a business account for our company. The teller was a typical white, close to middle aged woman with blonde hair (later we found out her name is Ashley). She was the least bit friendly, and spoke down to us as we were trying to get information. 

All we needed was to speak with the manager who was in charge of setting up business accounts, as it was not even her job to drill us on our company. But instead of doing her actual job, she decided to take it into her own hands because she didn’t even take us serious as potential clients. Then before we even mentioned the words crypto currencies, she treated us as though we looked too rundown to own a business. Sorry that I am not dressed up, we didn't know that customers were going to be treated differently by their look. After we informed her that we registered our company, she was like what kind of company. We told her that we own a company that works with crypto currencies. 

She then told us that Banner Bank does not work with people that do crypto currencies, they ban/freeze their accounts. When we asked her why, she said because it is a fraud. But this is legally accepted, there is no laws against crypto, in fact we pay a huge amount of taxes because we feel that we should follow the laws. 

We originally went with Banner Bank because they talked up this huge speal about not being a corporate bank that takes your money for everything. But what kind of bank decides to make its own laws that are not concurrent with the government. #BanBannerBank #BannerBankBansCrypto

479,"DO NOT PUT YOUR MONEY IN FREEWALLET. ALL OF MY FUNDS AND MY ID HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

First, please do not post comments that I should not have used Freewallet. I think that's pretty obvious now. It was a huge mistake but that doesn't make what they're doing any less criminal.

I suffer from cancer, which Ive told them already, but the Freewallet scam keeps on rolling. NO honest company has the HUNDREDS of scam complaints that these thieves at [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) do. Look up their previous posts to me.

For no valid reason, Freewallet began blocking customer access to their funds recently. Every ridiculous, phony excuse has been made, none of them true.

After absolutely assuring I would have access to my crypto after a simple ID submission, Freewallet instead obstructed my access by making an absurd claim that my ID photos had been edited. That is exactly the tactic I expected from this criminal organization. As I proved to them via video, all of my photos were 100&amp;#37; legitimate, completely unedited. On top of that, EVERY other crypto exchange that Ive submitted my ID to has NEVER even questioned it. WHY? Because the other exchanges are not scams like [**u/freewallet\_support**](https://www.reddit.com/user/freewallet_support/) is. Again, just look at the massive number of complaints. Search them. It speaks for itself.

Their tactic is beyond predictable for a scam. When they see they've encountered their worst nightmare, meaning me in this case, they begin resolving a few complaints here and there to make it look like they're trying to do right. All of those, however, are peanuts compared to my life savings. They would rather risk their necks than let that go back to its rightful owner. That's what lowlife scammers like Freewallet do.

Theyre so careless at Freewallet, that they never thought to consider Reddit posts CANNOT be deleted. This is NOT Facebook, where they delete customer complaints ALL the time.

Nothing matters to them but stealing my life savings. I have my life savings in there. I have given them EXACTLY what they asked for, and I still have NO access to my crypto.

My emails to them are now also with the US Attorney, who is the most prolific cyber crimes prosecutor on earth. They have already stated to my personal lawyer that a company who refuses to provide their own identities and location cannot lawfully ask customers for theirs. The USA's office labeled Freewallet ""an obvious scam"" in a call with my lawyer. Im a US customer, so Freewallet must abide by US law. The US has extradited many cyber criminals who have never even set foot in the US before, just because they stole from a US customer. They have that kind of extreme influence worldwide.

At this point my cancer symptoms have grown worse due to the stress Freewallet has caused me. I can barely breathe at times. However, I certainly expect to be here long enough to have them prosecuted, via the US Attorney, and their partner, Interpol.

Perhaps their biggest problem though, is I now know who their biggest figure is, whose operation is funded by stolen Freewallet funds like mine, and until my crypto is released to me, he can expect his life to be a nightmare.

You stole from the wrong cancer patient Freewallet... and now you're going to pay"
480,"I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be fiat consumer. That’s not my destiny. I don’t want to be centralised or sanctioned. I should like to trade with everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by the elite’s misery. We don’t want to starve and suffer from their sanctions. In this world there is room to trade with no discrimination for everyone. And trade not affecting the bottom. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
KYC has poisoned men’s souls, has discriminated the world with regulation whom have no I.D, has goose-stepped us into greed and HODL. We have developed P2P, but we have shut ourselves in. Bilderberg enforces evil that has left us in greed. Our portfolio has made us sour. Our experience, mining and impatient. We HODL too much and educate too little. More than development we need to think of the developing. More that, we need unification we need to adopt the bottom. Without these qualities, P2P will be handed over and all will be lost….
The internet and the encryption has brought us the best privacy. The very technicality of these inventions cries out for the goodness in future of investment - cries out for universal end to discrimination - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching billions throughout the world - billions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. …..
Crypto investors! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are free! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for decentralisation!

481,"We've seen the real-world use cases for ASICs many times, perhaps most notably in network switches. As switches evolved to do more intelligent processing, general purpose CPUs were not able to meet speed and energy efficiency requirements and thus, the eventual implementation of ASICs became the logical choice, as they were able to make switching decisions very quickly and much more efficiently. Over time, software-based processing via general purpose CPUs has no doubt increased greatly in both speed and efficiency, but even today, ASICs are still the logical choice when maximizing processing speed and energy efficiency.


With this in mind, I can't help but question why people are still so adamant about ASIC resistance.


I don't know if there are any algorithms in use today that are truly ASIC resistant, and even if there are, I don't think ASIC resistance is valuable property for a cryptocurrency on the layer one protocol level. The algorithms I've come across rely on complexity in order to discourage ASIC development, which in turn actually threatens decentralization since, if some entity were to eventually create an ASIC for one of these complex algorithms, no doubt other entities would have to undergo the burden of inventing an ASIC of their own. After all, we shouldn't assume that entities will freely share design blueprints. Thus, it would be an endeavour which would appear to be quite discouraging, as greater complexity would most likely translate into greater start up costs, and the fact that there would already be an ASIC manufacturer with an essential monopoly in the space would mean that new manufacturers would have to produce a product that is either adequately cheaper in price for the  consumer, or adequately more energy efficient, all while still maintaining desirable margins in order to stay afloat financially.


Of course, knowledgeable development teams would be aware of these concerns, and  would design software to allow for easy forking to different algorithms, should an ASIC ever be developed for the algorithm they were currently using. However, this not only highlights the issue of using algorithms which have never been tested outside of simulations (when applicable), but it also places the burden of consensus on the community. As we've seen, achieving consensus within a large community is not always a quick and easy process, even when the proposed changes are beneficial to the community at large. One could argue that part of the problem is that each consensus process is an opportunity for malicious actors (perhaps community members from a competing cryptocurrency) to cast their vote as well.


Details can be mulled over, but fundamentally, I believe ASIC resistance allows for more problems than ASIC acceptance.


On the other hand, algorithms that can easily be adopted for use with dedicated hardware allow for entities to manufacture ASICs with much lower start up costs in comparison to complex algorithms. As noted in the first paragraph, theoretically, ASICs allow for great processing power with less energy expense in comparison to general purpose CPUs of equal processing power. The reason that I use the word ""theoretically"" here is because in reality, ASICs are not only much more energy efficient than general purpose CPUs, but also, ASICs deliver much greater processing power than general purpose CPUs. So, even if some magical general purpose CPU that could match an ASIC in processing power existed, that CPU would still be far less efficient than the real-world ASICs we have today.


In summary, I have yet to find any strong arguments as to why ASIC resistance should be a desirable property of a cryptocurrency on the level one protocol level."

493,"Hey everyone,

My name is Malcolm and I've been writing about Bitcoin and other various cryptocurrencies for some time now. I chose to host my content on Medium.com. Unfortunately, it seems like they are very hostile to crypto; indeed, crypto-related accounts on this platform have been vanishing left and right for totally frivolous reasons (hi, /u/Jarunik !). 

Well, it finally happened to me. They didn't give me any warning so I could move my work elsewhere or resolve whatever TOS issue they had with my content.

500,"Hi. So in 2015 I bought 0.119 bitcoin.

In this time I was still learning about bitcoin, and knew very little about it.

\(still dont understand the fundamental function\) ennyway

The purchase was made in coinbase. What I can remember is that I downloaded a windows deskop wallet, witch took menny days if not 1 or 2 week to download blocks or something, when that was done the 0.119 was visible. 

I cant remember what wallet i used. 

# unfortunately that comupter is gone today.

My question is.. Is it a way I can recover that amount of bitcoin back.

Here is a link if it is for enny help..

I don’t understand why they have done this considering I’ve paid all my taxes for what I’ve withdrawn.

513,"Last Friday, I made a purchase from my bank account for a measly 200 bucks. The fees for buying directly from my checking account have always been much lower than using debit or credit cards, not to mention all of my cc's have banned the platform anyway. They applied the BTC to my account, but for the first time, I couldn't do anything with it outside of the Coinbase platform \(that includes moving it to GDAX\). The CB platform charges fees for every single transaction \(buy or sell\), in addition to boosting the price on all coins for purchases and then selling them back below market value as well \(this has got to the definition of economical double penetration, lol\). Today is Tuesday, and my 200 in BTC is still being held. So, I called their customer service.

To their credit, I was on hold for less than 3 minutes, and here is a paraphrase of the convo:

Me: I've made a deposit and I can't access it. I've made hundreds of deposits from this account in the past and its always been immediate access. I've never experienced this, can you please check it out?

CB: We recently updated our platform and you signed up to receive the update.

Me: No I didn't. I signed on to a pop\-up message that said my limits have been increased, but I never asked for or accepted any account upgrade; nor did I ask for my limits to be increased. You did that on your own. Can I go back to the old platform?

CB: No you can't. This is how the platform will operate for customers going forward.

Me: Look, the reason I made this purchase was to transfer those funds and purchase altcoins. The market is extremely volatile right now, and I want to diversify my portfolio. By the time you release the funds, the market could have rebounded and I lose a great opportunity.

CB: In regards to your deposit, you have to wait the until the deposit clears.

Me: It has cleared, and the funds were taken out of my account. I can prove it momentarily if you like.

CB: It has to clear our bank, not yours.

Me: I dont even know what that means. Your issue would seem to be crediting a buyer who turns out to have insufficient funds, which has never been my case.

CB: I'm sorry, we are not able to manually release funds.

Me: Are you going to give me interest for holding my $ without giving me access to it?

CB: No, once it clears, you will have access to it.

Me: My debit card from this bank does not allow me to purchase from you, but if I were to have used my debit card and subject myself to your insane fees \(the fees for using a card are wayyy more than for bank accounts\) would that have been instant access?

CB: Yes.

Me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5GS0MS5gU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5GS0MS5gU)

I've had a verified CB account \(from which I've made weekly deposits\) for a few years now; never had a real issue. I was always able to do whatever I wanted immediately as long as it wasn't a fiat deposit to the USD wallet. To add insult to injury, lol, I was an avid supporter of CB as I felt they have a rare and special opportunity to facilitate access while educating Main St. in regards to Bitcoin and crypto. Now, if I want to do anything with my coins, they are forcefking me to deposit via debit or credit card which incurs the highest fees their platform offers. 5 days after the purchase, I am still unable to trade, send, or even access the funds \(meaning I can't withdraw them\). Finally, I am able to see the true colors of Coinbase.

You are a greedy cck\-sucker Coinbase. I get that you're a business, and as an American, I respect that and your need to make a profit. However, your new terms of service resembles that of developing countries dictatorship. You tie people down and force them to operate within the avenues of your site that incurs insane fees! You are purposefully trapping people within your platform and forcing us to pay you if we want to do anything at all with our money. Isn't cryptocurrency supposed to allow me control of my money? Is my freedom to do what I want with my funds without anyone telling me how or when to do it not a backbone part of what decentralized currency is supposed to be all about?

In essence, you are going against the very bedrock foundation of what the asset that made you rich stands for, you greedy smug mf'er. I will not use my debit cards \(even if I could\), I refuse to let you force me to pay your insane fees, and you can suck my ballz. Sooner or later, someone will come thru and wrek your business model. Until then, you can suck on BBC. \(\&lt;\-\-\-\-\- not a coin\)."

519,"So, I've been dicking around today, playing games, drinking, etc. The kind of shit you do when you're just off in your own space and I had a couple of ideas that I thought were pretty decent. I'm eagerly looking forward to having them destroyed. I think I've got it, though. Really.

In short, its a credit agency almost completely decoupled from an individuals identity, that relies on a historical blockchain transaction data and modern analytics to determine if an individual is a good risk or not.

Now I realize this sounds simple, but it seems like such an obvious place for bitcoin to start. I don't have details worked out since this is a day dream, more or less, and its also not my field even remotely, but the question I was asking when I came up with this notion is ""what can bitcoin do that legacy banking systems cannot?"".

The answers I came up with were 

1. An open source, secure, unforgeable, database of historical *transactions*.

2. An insanely fast settlement layer. Between LN and the blockchain its just no contest anymore. This is where I want some parsing. Without talking about TPS, which is a tech problem that is being solved, please explain to me why the ad hoc system like Visa (or MC, AE, Discover, etc) +  whatever your random banks loan officer is superior to the publicly available and instantly verifiable data that could be gleaned from whatever blockchain you happen to use?

3. There just isn't as much of a need for personal information. Credit agencies are a MASSIVE weak point in our financial system as Equifax so cleanly demonstrated to us. Having a third party centralizing personal identifying data that could be used for identity theft is a tremendous risk. If you're an American, its safe to assume at this point that your personal identifying data, all of which can be used to completely demolish your ability to obtain lines of credit or finance major life events, is pretty much publicly available. Rather than having control of your *own data*, under the legacy system you've ceded control of it, like in the case of equifax, to a music major who cares so much about your identity that literally all of your personal data was exposed to internet protected by the password ""admin"". If you think this level of opsec and care is an outlier, I've got a bridge to sell you, payable in bitcoin. Super cheap, too. I'll underbid freaking anyone. Try me.

In any case, since loans are being distributed based on middling at best quality data, the massively superior quality of data that pretty much any publicly auditable blockchain is capable of delivering would make this service a no brainer. 

Think, a Cambridge Analytica who, instead of trying to subvert the political will of people internationally, was able to use the bitcoin blockchain coupled analytic techniques to provide sub prime loans for housing that were *actually safe bets and not likely to blow up the global financial system*. 

My wife and I recently bought our first house, and its insane to me how some of these businesses decide who to loan to. I mean, I had to provide paychecks and whatnot, but those are all forgeable documents, you know? Tax records, likewise, but how difficult would it be to set up a shell company for no other purpose but to pay taxes for no other reason but to acquire a significantly larger amount of money with no intent of paying it back? Personal data used to be the safeguard, but since its essentially public information at this point, how could you possibly make lending decisions like that knowing that who you're sitting in front of could be pretty much anyone? I'm sure there's insurance and governmental guarantees and whatnot, but all of that is, frankly, superfluous financial infrastructure if you could dial down those risks. 

Also: super short term loans.

For most people, the notion of grabbing a million+ dollar loan out of thin air is absurd. For banks, its equally absurd. There's so much due diligence required on the back end to determine an individuals credit worthiness that amounts to little more than digging through and aggregating historical financial data that lending to people who may not have the same kind of financial history as, say, the already wealthy that it rapidly becomes not worth the effort at all unless your bank account is sufficiently large and you have significant collateral to provide. Blockchains not only aggregate a lot of that data for you, but they provide previously impossible transaction/account scrutiny. Say, for instance, massive subset of people who payback their loans have a tendency to spend and receive cash in a very specific pattern, its entirely possible that in the future those data points become WAY more important for evaluating credit worthiness than something as rudimentary as a missed payment, you know?

I feel like missed payments and other significant factors in your credit worthiness are more of a best guess based on currently available information, but there's a real possibility that information contained in a massive open source database like bitcoin could prove to be a much more accurate smoking gun that could, at the end of the day, mitigate risks to the lender and create a situation where many, many more people have access to financial services because lenders have access to better, more granular financial data, and those lenders, as a result, make a LOT more money.

Our current legacy system has, as its backbone, a level of inscrutability. That inscrutability has provided some level of security by obscurity, but the world has changed dramatically in the past 20 plus years. Obscurity is rightly recognized as not security at all, but as onerous complexity. This recognizance, however, has not been shared by some financial businesses which rely on obscurity as security since changing the business model up costs money and why would they waste money?

There's a massive sucking sound, and that sound is obscurity being pulled out of the room by quality information, AI, and the ability of engineers to ask the right, most pertinent questions. Many of our most important institutions are run by older folks who often struggle to reckon with an update to their phone, let alone a technological revolution of their livelihood. 

This represents a business opportunity for those of us who are nimble. 

USAA has a very strong business model that, in part, relies, or relied initially anyhow, on the fact that military people and their families are cheaper to insure and bank for than others. Gmail pulled a similar thing when it came out, but failed in the same strategy with google plus. The reason it worked with USAA and Gmail and not with google plus, is because at the time those services were legit superior products. I had shitty ass hotmail at the time Gmail got rolled out, and back then there was no comparison. I can't really speak to USAA as much. I bank with them and they're pretty run of the mill, tbh, cheaper on some things, not so much on others, but the I kinda think USAA had its heyday a while ago. 

Likewise, gmail isn't a much better service than, say, outlook or yahoo or whatever.

But it was at one point.

We're at that point with bitcoin. Bitcoiner specific services will make this ecosystem explode. If you, as someone who owns bitcoin, can get a credit card for, say, half the APR of a non bitcoiner, you'd have people buying bitcoin like hotcakes and if there's one undeniable truth about bitcoin and other cryptos its that they are bull and bear amplifiers in an unprecedented way.

Banks aren't going away anytime soon. Neither is bitcoin. The future is an a weird marriage of the two and the way it gains traction is by giving the early adopters a hell of a deal."
520,"So, I thought people were saying the price was supposed to go UP during and after Consensus 2018, not DOWN.

There are over 7500 participants this year, some of the biggest names in tech and government (for better or worse).

I guess this means, with yet another data point, that this market is completely unpredictable. And anyone who sells you dreams of bitcoin reaching xx price by xx date, should be taken with a grain of salt, no matter what their accolades. The simple truth is that the only thing that will increase the price of bitcoin is increasing use of it.

This is why it's so important for the community to actually buy and spend. This stagnation is caused by all users, not just a few.

Mind you, stagnation is relative. We're still up around 500% from this time last year. But days and years in bitcoin happen about 1000x faster than just about any other industry."

With participation limited to USA only at the moment it is hard to find much if any information on it in the UK apart from press releases which are scarce of details. It leaves me wondering what the differences will be between Sachs Usd Coin and it's already established competitor usd Tether? 

Given the bad press Tether has been receiving recently in regards to lack of audits and rumours that it's backing account does not reflect the amount of coins now in circulation a usd backed coin with a highly established, all be it morally questionable corporation, at the helm might just be what cryptos need right now. 

This is a bold statement as having a decentralised currency propped up by the reputation of a centralised corporation like Sachs seems to go completely against the crypto ethos but if it helps new investors that are hesitant to get involved and also helps people who are currently invested but finding it hard or don't know how to convert back to fiat, or have little faith in companies that already offer this service, to do so without worrying. Something tether does not offer.

530,"I got into an argument with a co-worker over whether Ben Franklin deserves credit for defending the inalienable right to create our own currency. Ironically, Franklin is on the $100 bill but I don't think he'd want to be. 

In 1729, a 23-year-old Franklin wrote [A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/publications/economic-education/ben-franklin-and-paper-money-economy.pdf) In it, he argued for a new currency that brought economic stability to working classes and angered established elites. After the revolution, Franklin was instrumental in establishing a currency that helped pull people out of poverty, writing  ""Where there is a free government, and the people make their own laws by their representatives, I see no injustice in their obliging one another to take their own paper money."" The Colonial Scrip, and Britain outlawing the colonial currency, eventually became major points on the road to Revolution.

As my co-worker points out, while Franklin was supportive of a national bank issuing notes backed by gold and silver reserves, he wasn't as outspoken against the idea of a national bank as Jefferson was: 

""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.""  - Thomas Jefferson  

We could not agree on whether Franklin or Jefferson deserved more credit for the original stance on defending the freedom to create currency. But since Franklin is more iconic we went with him for our design:

This way, those who hold higher amounts have a stronger voting power than those who don’t. Proof-of-Stake defenders admit it and say that hardly someone who owns a huge amount of a PoS-based currency could act in a way that could be negative for the currency’s blockchain, since this user would see his portfolio also losing value if the currency presented some flaws due to his behavior. If, however, a competitor does a calculated investment, buying lots of coins or even persuading several heavy-holders to act in ways that could break the network (i.e. voting in invalid blocks, DoSing etc.), would not it be able to break the currency ecosystem? Also, is PoS not dangerous for the currency democratic system, since if you do not hold a good amount, your voting power is almost nullable?

Bitcoin is in danger of sliding towards $8,000 but is supported above $8,250 during the intraday session on Thursday. There is a classic falling wedge pattern forming on the charts where Bitcoin price is trading lower highs and almost ranging lows. The buyers are have put their best foot forward to prevent major declines, however, BTC/USD is down a subtle 0.40% in the last 24 hours at the time of press.

PayPal launched Bitcoin payments back in 2015, however the CFO at the online payment guru, John Rainey says that at the moment the same merchants are not interested in taking virtual currency payments. Mr Rainey, while on CNBC’s Mad Money segment narrated how PayPal was among the first to allow merchants to accept cryptos years back. However, Rainey says “right now, we don't see a lot of interest from our merchants."" He added that this does not take away the support for Bitcoin:

""But if it is something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that.""

Bitcoin price is testing the prevailing resistance area at $8,300, although it is still in danger of sliding. The buyers are eyeing $8,500 (100 SMA), but in the meantime, $8,400 is enough. The 50 SMA will offer resistance as the price attempts to correct higher close to $8,350. On the downside, $8,250 is a short-term support zone, but further declines beyond this level will be halted at $8,200 and $8,100.

545,"Guys, this is HUGE! There was a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8k0tch/bitcoin_booming/?st=jhb34fag&amp;sh=44e63c71) earlier here in r/bitcoin about [Climb real estate] (https://i.redd.it/4i3af9x6yby01.jpg) and there was a sign underneath it saying that they accept bitcoin. Now most of us might be like, oh yeah right, probably they are not serious, and to be honest this is what I thought too!

So I have decided to contact them via [chat](https://i.imgur.com/LlsVCO8.jpg), and right away they said that they will only accept US dollars. Was kinda disappointed at that point, but I thought it might be a robot who I was talking, so I decided to try via email. 

They have responded to my email pretty fast, and they confirmed that they indeed accept BTC for payment. 

I asked about the following:
-I’m curious of the procedure of a purchase in bitcoin. Could you please let me know in detail how it works?
-It’s very easy. I process up to $10M in Bitcoin into escrow account and close deals 7-10 days after.
The process is like this. You choose a house that you like and want. I process your Bitcoin through BitPay by invoice within 24 hrs. That money goes directly into escrow account and we close 7-10 days after. And after that you are the owner of a beautiful home

Now some of you may think that this is not that big of a news, but let me tell you that it defiantly is a big news. 

A real estate agent accepting a cryptocurrency is the **best thing** that can ever happen to crypto. 

Lets hope that this is one out of many that will (hopefully) follow. 

I'm currently not in a position to look for a house/property, but I know, that within the next few years, I will be, and my goal is to be able to buy my first house fully out of crypto.

Thank you for Climb real estate for helping adoption! "
546,I want to know is it safe to sell bitcoin and receive the payment in Western Union or Money Gram?  What if the buyer sends to me the Western Union check from the stolen credit card?  Will I get the reverse money?  Which one has the lower fee to send money Western Union or Money Gram?  Thank you.

550,"## Mining 1 coin \(BTC\)

1. Miners try to find the nonce to solve for the difficulty.  If they do, then they submit the block to the blockchain.

## Merge mining

Here's how I think it works.  Can someone correct me if I'm wrong?

1. Let's say BTC and SBTC \(from rsk\) are merge mined.
2. Miners go through nonces the same as they would for BTC, except this time they are also checking to see if they solved SBTC's block.  
3. If this is true, how much more energy or computer power is used to merge mine?"
