1,"Hi,

I apologize for yet another post on the fork but I've been doing research on how to prepare myself and my bitcoin for the upcoming fork and while I understand most of it, I have a few lingering questions.

First, let me summarize what I learned. Please correct me if I am wrong. This fork, unlike the BCH fork, has no built-in replay protection. This means that any transaction I make on the BTC blockchain is also valid on the B2X blockchain and vice versa. So while I meant to send someone 0.1BTC, if someone chooses to replay that transaction on the B2X chain, I could end up sending 0.1BTC + 0.1B2X. However, there is opt-in protection, where on every transaction, you send a small amount of bitcoin to a special address that is not valid on the other chain. This will make sure your transaction is rejected on the other chain.

Now, for my questions:

1. This fork should not affect me receiving bitcoin correct? I should be able to continue buying safely on an exchange like Coinbase and send it to my Ledger Nano (discounting human / programming error by the exchange itself) as if bitcoin did not fork correct?

2. How am I supposed to send a small amount of bitcoin to these special addresses along with a transaction? To me, a transaction has always been 1 address to 1 address with amount X. Certainly it can't be two separate transactions as that doesn't make sense either.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. :)"
2,"With Bitcoin soaring up high, I'm just curious how I can use my money in such a way that I don't need to worry about revenue services getting a blip on their radar. Now I'm not say tax evasion just manipulation ;)

If I'm purchasing items with bitcoin ( not fiat currency), am I correct in assuming that that doesn't allow it to be looped in and taxed as capital gains?"
3,"I am taken quite by surprise by the latest growth of Bitcoin and not only because of the actual price increase but because of how close the B2X fork is. I assumed that right before and after the fork people would be reluctant to trade as they would wait for things to settle and see what the actual outcome will be. Yet, the complete opposite is happenning. Bitcoin is being bought massively. 


Several articles have popped up about Wall St. investing massive amounts in Bitcoin and it made me think why wouldn't the big ""pro-B2X"" players do the same? That is, buy an enormous amount of BTC before the fork to then proceed in millions of micro-transactions on B2X in order to lure the miners away from BTC.


I am new to all of this so my reasoning might be flawed. If this is the case please enlighten me as to why this is an improbable scenario."
4,"While purchasing cryptocurrency finding/keeping track of news/content was a pain in the ass. I had a small amount of free time so I decided to create an aggregator. I spent a few hours gathering social media links, icons, and crypto youtube channels. Every few minutes the content is pulled through the various API's organized by upload/creation timestamp and finally displayed in chronological order. Here are the page breakdowns: 
 
**Dashboard/Homepage** Displays a mix of content from all cryptocurrencies and crypto youtubers

**Coin Page** Displays content from crypto youtubers only

**Crypto Youtube Content** Display filtered content based on the cryptocurrency you selected, Also displays the social media, github, and tradingview ( chart forcasts ) links I could find

*Each page displays content in chronological order*

I will continue to add onto this service during my free time, including adding additional news/social media outlets. If you have any suggestions visit the [Feature Request](http://metavs.net/feature-request) page to submit a new idea.

5,"Hi,

I had a couple of questions about the upcoming fork. My goal is to basically get the new forked coin ASAP and then sell them off in favor of the original BTC. 

Right now I only own a fraction of BTC and it is stored in a wallet on my exchange (I know bad idea). I think they will take some time before the implement the functionality to allow me to access my forked coin, so there will be a delay in accessing it.

How does the fork work if I have software wallet ? Would I have access to it right away ?"
6,"There should really be a sticky or some mega-thread discussing this. We are currently moving closer to the hardfork and it might come quicker than expected. Also, it would be good to know when the snapshot of the chain is taken in order to be ready for market fluctations i.e. moving things around to manage risk prior to the fork (if possible).

Personally, I have no clue where I should store my BTCs prior to the hardfork. Coinbase came out today stating that they will credit B2X coins based on your BTC holdings prior to the fork. And they will pause any transactions for 24h following the fork. How does this compare to my Ledger Nano S? And how do I move ahead if I wish to trade my BTC or the mirrored B2X without losing any of them unintentionally due to no replay protection? 

I would love to get a discussion going based on the different scenarios that may take place, and how we can plan/prepare for each. If you believe I am grossly uneducated by asking these questions, please provide resources that may help me and others wondering. "
7,"Many people are suggesting Mycelium but Coinbase looks more user friendly. Coinbase also has much more to offer and users, is it a better option? "
8,Will microtransactions ever be viable if the C02 emissions per transaction is higher than it is for visa card transactions? Is this something that could be over come? 
9,"This is a complete newbie post on here but im looking to invest some money into bitcoin and looking for some advice? I was gonna take out a small loan of 1000 and invest it all into bitcoin, I've seen how it's gone from like 900 this time last year to like 6071 right now! That's an insane jump in price, I can afford the loan as I work a steady job and get paid to go to college so it's not something I wouldn't be able to pay off. Would 1000 turn over some profit or would I have to invest in a whole coin? I'm newish to stocks and currencies but have an idea on how they actually work, any advice would be great! Thanks ✌"
10,"Invested heavily over the summer in LTC, XRP &amp; ETH under the assumption that the BTC ship had sailed. Obviously the wrong call for the short term. As of today that's been changed to majority BTC....They'd grill me on those AltCoin subs for not holding / giving into FOMO but I call it common sense. Main point is that like many others, I learned that BTC is no ordinary crypto. Cheers. "
11,"I know many businesses already support it, but think about the whole world. 
Bitcoin is SUPER complicated compared to a dollar. 

You need seeds, exchanges, and the worst of all, forks happen. 
The price of BTC fluctuates too much. What happens when you are in debt with BTC and your debt only increases. Do prices of everything change every day?"
12,"Been buying bitcoin for over a year now (so it’s not a new phenomenon for me) however have never hodled. I’ve seen the light now though, and been looking  to seriously invest for around 6-8 weeks now. 

At first though, I wanted to wait till after the Gold fork as I was watching the price rise and rise, but I just figured this was due to people wanting free coins and was SURE the price would drop straight after. It never did. 

So the last week I’ve been wanting to buy, but just been waiting for even the slightest of dip before firing. It’s still not here. Now that we’ve passed the $7000 point, I genuinely don’t know what to do. The FOMO is hurting big time. 

I even slightly feel now that the price is over exaggerated and after the next fork, the price will bomb. Is it too late to buy? Should I wait till after the next fork?

(I had planned on doing the average price method and just buy every few days or so as recommended on here)"
13,"I’m aware with Coinbase/Blockchain I don’t really own it. Would prefer something free as I haven’t invested much yet.

____________

pardon the wall of text but this is super important to me.



i am a hardcore bitcoin evangelist and my entire facebook friend list probabaly associates me with bitcoin because i spend a great deal of time educating people and discussing it on social media. my background is computer network engineering and web developing; i've studied bitcoin for a few years now.

**first** i wanna talk about USI Tech.

not long ago i was asked to invest some bitcoin via a company called USI Tech. at the time, USI Tech's only relation to bitcoin was that they sold cryptic ""bitcoin packages"" that would return 140% over 140 days. that means if i gave them 1 BTC today, they would give me 1% of a bitcoin for 140 days, meaning that after 100 days, my initial investment would be recovered, and then all i get to do is wait for those 40 days to see my profit.

when i was first recruited, it was before they rebranded themselves. this was just a few weeks ago. prior to this rebranding, there was no indication from the company regarding exactly how they were able to provide that kind of return on investment. at the time their only product other than these ""bitcoin packages"" was a license that provided access to a very special very secretive robot that harnessed artificial intelligence to yield apparently handsome returns via speculative arbitrage in the foreign exchange market. there are zero trades attributed to this ""robot"" and in fact there is zero evidence of a robot at all. they do have software for their customers that apparently track gains however there is zero correlation between these numbers and their apparent source.


since their rebranding, they are now marketing these ""bitcoin packages"" as having generated income via *cloud mining*. keep in mind that USI Tech does not sell hashrate, nor even techinically access to remote hardware; USI Tech sells ""bitcoin packages"" however how these packages specifically relate to hashrates accessed on remote hardware, or *cloud mining*, is not at all explained. [in fact, here on their website they say that details will be released and then reference a date that has already passed.](http://www.usitech.io/usi-tech-info/usi-tech-mining-news/).

to be blunt, cloud mining is a meme. mining cryptocurrency for a profit is generally difficult even for the big boys in China. that bitcoin could be worth more in the future than it is now is the reason why miners mine; the energy spent mining bitcoin costs more than the value of those mined bitcoins. 

how does USI Tech not only mine so successfully that they themselves can be profitable, but so that customers who purchase this mining remotely can be successful **to the tune of 140% over 140 days?**


also they are in pre-sale for their own ICO, 

also they have zero registration documents filed with the SEC, 

also the names that *used* to be on their masthead, Ralf Gold and Joao Severino, were involved in past scams,

also their business is registered in Dubai, just like almost every single forex ponzi,

also like i said there is zero proof that they trade anything at all, anywhere.


**i really thought i knew my shit. is there a more experienced bitcoin user that can point to any situation where that sort of profitibility can be achieved by cloud mining?**

if the question seems rhetorical for the high bitcoin minds on this sub, then maybe i've done my duty by exposing USI Tech's dubious claims and raising suspicion which brings me to my next point:

**secondly** i wanna talk about the tactics used by this company to fool people.

primarily i should say that USI Tech operates a multilevel marketing structure that rewards recruitment through commission. it is not a coincidense that ponzi schemes use MLM structures to grow; ponzis require a continuous flow of new investment in order to work. to be blunt, MLM is a predatory business approach that exploits people's hope and greed. all MLM use the same tactic of targeting people's desperation to earn passive income.

*USI Tech takes advantage of a population of people who are desperate to invest in a technology they do not comprehend.* this is how they can get away with selling something that there is no evidence of. people now have a very dire desire to be involved in bitcoin because they have seen the news. people that do not know enough about investments, let alone cryptography, are aching to enter the space before all the potential is claimed.

there is much fertile potential to scam people who don't know that hyperbole like *""smart contracts made off-chain that return high yield arbitration via intelligent algorithms backed by authenticated crypto-asset bonds..""* is all bullshit. in most cases, even if they could, there is no code to review, no whitepaper to digest, and in the case of USI Tech, not even satisfacory rhetoric to substantiate anything being sold by these scammers.

earlier today, i went into a facebook group called USI TECH BITCOIN TEAM SUCCESS, and i asked a question. i said ""i'm interested in joining USI Tech, and as a programmer and bitcoin nerd, i want to know the details of their mining operation.""
immediately the reaction was two-fold. promptly some were chiming in with agreeable sentiments like 'i've also wondered' and 'yes there is a lack of transparency', and others were already indignant with stuff like 'they said they are working on transparency give them a break' and 'troll detected, usi tech is not a scam because look i made money'.

okay fair enough the conversation was started and i was pretty quickly banned from the group. i had a dozen or so people in my ear at this point asking me what happened, people that have invested real money in this company. i spent hours discussing this with some of them. i had a conversation with the group's admin, [here it is](https://imgur.com/a/YyljQ). he basically says that he doesn't want to upset people that have found a way to make money, and that my questions should be directed somewhere else.

i've sent exhaustive emails pondering specifics to USI Tech to no avail.

**in conclusion, bitcoin has provided rich new opportunities for scamming people.**

let me be clear: yes money can be made in a ponzi scheme. *the operative to earning money in a ponzi is to know when to discontinue reinvestment.* by all means, partake in the ponzi even, so long as you know what you are contribtuing to. the number one argument that people will make in favor of the ponzi they're in is 

""but i made money"".

it is our duty as crypto-enthusiasts to spread responsible education regarding bitcoin. i say to people ""if you are interested in bitcoin, invest in bitcoin, because that is where the actual innovation is"".

**TL;DR:** fuck bitcoins ponzis like USI Tech, stay alert, stay safe.

24,"C'mon and join the effort to keep bitcoin decentralized!  (And to fight this S2X nonsense)

I have an Intel-based DS916+ so YMMV of course depending on your model! (I heard that non-intel models do not support docker)

1. Go to Package Center, search for ""docker"" and install it.  Open the Docker app.
2. Go to the Docker app and click on the Registry section.  Search for ""bitcoin""
3. Select ""ruimarinho/bitcoin-core"".  This one is appears to be the most up to date and has 0.15.0.1.  Click Download, and select the ""latest"" tag.
4. In the Image section, click Launch with ruimarinho/bitcoin-core selected.
5. Go to the ""advanced settings"", then ""port settings"".
6. Change all of the ""auto"" to the actual port number.  (IE, bind the external 8333 to the internal 8333)
7. Click OK to dismiss the dialog, then Next, then Apply.  Your node is now running!
8. Setup your home internet router to forward ports 8333 and 18333 to your Synology.  You should also have assigned a static IP to your Synology.  For additional help about all the firewall and NAT forwarding stuff, check out https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#enabling-connections

You can verify if your node is fully reachable by the outside world by going to https://bitnodes.earn.com/#join-the-network

*Side Note*: I'm not sure, but maybe you can skip all the port forwarding stuff if in the advanced settings, under network, you select ""use same network as docker host"", and maybe it will be able to work automatically like described in https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#network-configuration, but I didn't test that. 

Questions:

1. I don't need to open 18333 on the router for testnet, right?  The bitcoind appears to be running on the normal blockchain and I don't plan on running the testing blockchain.
2. Why was the docker image setup for port forwards on 18332, 18444, and 8332?  Is that for the RPC client to interact with the bitcoin daemon?  Or did the docker image maintainer just set those there as the are common alternate configurations?"

There are so many different wallets and exchanges, I wanna make sure this would be a fairly safe/reliable method for buying and storing bitcoins.

Also, with the split/fork coming up, it's my understanding that your Bitcoins are duplicated and copied into the B2X chain, meaning you would have both coins, based on the value of your BTC holdings at the fork.

43,"Recently I've been thinking about what it would be like if Bitcoin became mainstream, and I really like the idea however I think that there's one huge flaw in Bitcoin.


It's a known issue that's been brought up several times, but from what I've seen it's been mostly ignored for some reason and not treated like a serious issue.


The problem is that there are definitely not enough Bitcoins to run the global economy. I think that the reason why people completely ignore this problem is because they don't realize how fragile cryptocurrencies are.


If we assume 21 million bitcoins, which is 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis then it's just enough to run the global economy. The value of current 1 cent would be about 21 satoshis. However people don't even realize how extreme the rate at which cryptocurrencies can be lost forever is. There are so many reasons this can happen, e.g. someone forgets his key or simply dies.


It's safe to assume that within 10 years we can end up with only 0.5 million Bitcoins in circulation. If it had to replace the current dollar, then it would mean that 1 satoshi would already be 2 cents.


0.5 million Bitcoins is still a very optimistic scenario, an order of magnitude too optimistic.


This is in my opinion the biggest flaw currently. There's no chance Bitcoin will ever run global economy with its current supply.


The only solution I can think of is to hard-fork bitcoin and somehow add ~16 more decimal places, though I'm not sure if it's possible.


Any thoughts? What are the proposed solutions to this problem? Why do people completely ignore this?"

45,"It's absolutely ridiculous how many threads and conversations revolve around the same old argument. Bitcoin was a currency for small day to day purchases, but it's not anymore. However that is not Bitcoins fault. It comes down to economic fundamentals, it comes down to us and way we spend. 

Image you had a wallet with $1000 worth of litecoin and in the other wallet is $1000 worth of Bitcoin. Now fast forward to July 2018 and your Bitcoin is now worth $2000 and your litecoin is $1100. Zip back to Nov 2017 and ask yourself which crypto will you spend to buy that new iPad? The point is why would we spend from an asset (Bitcoin) that is appreciating in value over one that is relatively price stable (litecoin) we wouldn't, it just wouldn't make good economic sense.

Bitcoin is fine as is, it doesn't need to change so its better for day to day purchases, as I said its about how we spend not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently heading in the right direction and if innovative upgrades like Segwit keep on coming I'm sure it will. Lets face it, Bitcoin has become something more important, more useful than just a P2P digital currency. It is now central to the growth and strength of the entire cryptocurrency sector.  Bitcoin has become an investment tool for the masses, a settlement layer, a currency for larger purchases and its become a store of value and that store of value relies on the 8 years of confidence that it currently has, and that confidence needs to be maintained so we can continue seeing growth and draw in new crypto-enthusiasts. 

Aggressive moves from the B2X and BCH camps if unsuccessful will only help to strengthen Bitcoin and improve user confidence, but the danger is 'what if' one of them was successful and managed to weaken or even replace Bitcoin, the instability that would create could be extremely damaging.

B2X corporate-coin and BCH Wu-coin put up the argument that Bitcoin has deviated from Satoshi's vision, its no longer a P2P for day to day purchases and so now their coins should replace it. Thats a smoke-screen, the only reason why these aggressors want to replace Bitcoin is so they can steal Bitcoins brand and the value/confidence thats stored within the brand. Put simply they want to profit and they want power at the expense of Bitcoins value to the entire crypto-community.

We have some very good alternatives for day to day purchases, ones that are relatively price stable, Litecoin for one, it was designed especially to be the silver to Bitcoins gold, to be the currency for day to day purchases. We can use that, or Dash even Monero all are reasonably price stable, but to my mind Litecoin is the standout. We can use them and not mess with Bitcoin, just allow Bitcoin to carry on the way it's going. "

**What is Paradise Papers?**

The Paradise Papers is a database comprising around 13.4 million documents, which reveals over 25,000 companies owned by the world's rich and influential individuals.

The documents were obtained from two companies in Singapore and Bermuda by a German newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). A major part of the Paradise Papers comprises leaked files from company 'Appleby'.

The files reveal data of over 25,000 companies owned by individuals from 180 countries, from 1950 to 2016.

Below is a comparison of Paradise Papers with Panama Papers:

----

**Number of politicians and public officials**

* Paradise Papers: 127 politicians and public officials (14 current or former country leaders included) from more than 47 countries

* Panama Papers: 140 politicians and public officials from more than 50 countries

----

**Which leak is the bigger than other?**

Paradise Papers is bigger in number of records (13.5 million in Paradise Papers vs. 11.5 million in Panama Papers) and Panama Papers is bigger in terms of size of the leak (1.4 Tb in Paradise Papers vs. 2.6 Tb in Panama Papers).

Due to that, I would recommend to say ""one of the biggest leaks in the history of journalism"" instead of the biggest and then you could compare some of the different figures related to the data size between Paradise Papers and previous leaks.

----

**Journalists in Paradise Papers project**

Media partners, countries, journalists

* Number of journalists 381

* Number of media partners 96

* Number of countries 67

If you just consider the number of journalists, yes. There are more journalists working on the Paradise Papers than the Panama Papers at the time of the project release (381 Paradise Papers - 376 Panama Papers).

As for the number of media partners and number of countries, there are a few less. Panama Papers had 100+ media partners and 76 countries. The ICIJ currently has for Paradise Papers 96 media partners and 67 countries.

Now that I am trying to get accounts to buy bitcoin on I am noticing most places require me to be 18. I have been trading forex for about a year, but I can do this on my dad’s account and it is much easier. 

I am wondering which sites I could use to trade bitcoin and other currencies under the age of 18. 

Also, could I just have Mom or Dad setup an account for me to trade? Could my account potentially be shut down? I would h using my own bank account and credit card so I don’t know if I would even pass the identification part of the signup.

I know I'll technically own both after the fork, but can i sell them independently of each other ? How is that going to work? No way I'm just going to have .3 of both and they both can be sold whenever I want... 

THanks for the help, and hopefully in years to come we'll get to know each other more!!!"
54,"I think bitcoin currently is just a tool to get more wealth. It's a bit in the ""Unknown"" category. In other words, not many people know about it; but those who are savvy at this moment can get some substantial wealth if they invest.

The way I see it, the dollar is failing and our current economy isn't able to keep up. The average median income in America is $50,000 - Which is laughable. There is no way, that the average annual income of 50k a year is going to sustain the oncoming generations, hence the need for Bitcoin. 

As Bitcoin continue to evolves, I think it will be just as common. In my opinion, it is simply a tool to level the playing field of those who are in positions of power. For instance, some of these ""APP"" jobs have given more power to the people rather than to corporations. 

Side jobs like Amazon flex, Postmasters, Lyft etc; which pay roughly $15-25 an hour are basically starting people with a leg up, over the laughable minimum wage. To this day, I still think people are still being duped into doing the College degree route, because, that's just ""What they are being told to do.""

10 years ago, College didn't make sense to me. It still doesn't. I see people with college degrees struggling to get by. Today, I read articles on millenials with full 4 year degrees unemployed, looking for work, and taking jobs. The other day, I met a kid who graduated with a Neuroscience degree @ age 23 with $70,000 in debt. 

What a very stupid ""Educated"" individual.

I don't think Bitcoin is going to be the End all and Be all in our society. I think in 50 years, bitcoin will be an average currency. In other words, I believe It's sort like bringing the american Dollar back to 1901 - In that is is ""resetting"" the economy in a sense. Those of us who are ""In the know"" now, and play our cards right can be well off for the next 20-40 years.

However, I don't think it will last forever, just like everything else. Life evolves and as we progress, we need to keep our eye on the ball on our own personal goals and be open to whatever comes upon the horizon of humanity. We all know the dollar is shit at the moment. It will continue to become shit, and thus this is simply of humanities way of adjusting. 

In the future, hell, who knows what will arise. Bitcoin might be the dominating currency and the dollar won't even exist anymore. If that's the case, then eventually bitcoin will follow the same route the dollar went, and then what will happen? only time will tell I guess. "
55,"Starting to dive in to the technical details behind Bitcoin and had a basic question. When your wallet creates a new address, how does it know that someone else isn’t already using that private key? Is it just relying on a true random number in the 2^256 possible addresses being unique each time or are there other safeguards? What if a malicious/non-savvy wallet creator didn’t truly use a random number but something that actually is an existing private key?

Sorry for the noob question."

        XBT 0.01
        EUR 38.54

    The trade is closed. No further action is required. These balances will stay unchanged until a new trade is done.

2. You buy 0.01 XBT. You have an ""open position"" (long in XBT) of 0.01 XBT. It is waiting to be closed one day, and then the P&amp;L (profit &amp; loss) is calculated. Similar to this [screenshot](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201424378/Illustration.png). At the end of the open/close position (let's say the XBT has increased a little between the open and the close), the new balance is calculated with the P&amp;L:

        EUR 103.13

**Is Kraken doing 1. or 2.?**

___

As far as I know Forex (non-crypto) trading platforms use the system 2. For example if you have an EUR deposit / balance and you're trading EUR/USD, you can never withdraw in USD. You just open/close positions, and then the P&amp;L is applied on the EUR balance.

It's not clear for me if Kraken offers 1. or 2."

But:

If they guarantee that the payouts will be with ""dust"" from newly minted coins, could I use them as replay protection?

Can I not distribute them to ""all my accounts"" on the segwit2x chain, and then send all my coins to new accounts on the segwit2x chain, making sure they contain some of this dust? They'll not be able to be replayed on the BTC chain, so now they are in different addresses and replay protected?

This means that if a retailer would accept payments through Coinbase e-mail you could buy goods from them without any fee with your Coinbase account.  

Now there are obviously bigger companies, like PayPal that have established themselves as trusted payment providers, but they are not into crypto's yet.  

Coinbase as far as I know is focusing on just being an exchange.  

Bitcoin in its current form is headed towards being a store of value, while also having too high fees for smaller/instant purchases on busy days.

104,"A global financial crisis is a state of worldwide economic unrest experienced by both the market and the consumer. The 2008 global financial crises manifested as a result of the banks putting too much money in circulation, thereby causing the price of mortgages to plummet. This lead to the housing market in the United States suffering greatly as many home owners who had taken out sub-prime loans found they were unable to meet their mortgage repayments, rendering the debts irredeemable. Banks were in turmoil worldwide. Economies collapsed, fiat currencies faltered and markets crushed.
People started buying up lands, gold, silver etc as a store of value; the traditional money was failing and the need for this came up. It’s no coincidence that it was around this time, January 2009, that the first Bitcoin was mined using the decentralized blockchain technology. Decentralization makes the Bitcoin network operate on a user to user basis, existing outside of a central authority. It is totally independent of the bank and the government has no control over it. One can’t help but wonder if Bitcoin was solely created as a solution in the case of another global financial crisis.
The future of Bitcoin in the case of another global financial crisis can be predicted accurately to an extent by using the current economic situation in Zimbabwe, where the financial system is a complete mess, as an example. The situation has deteriorated to a point at which banks only pay out customers a small fraction of their holdings. This goes on without anybody raising an eyelid in the country—it’s the norm. Zimbabwe abandoned its local currency and adopted the US Dollar in 2009. The country has since run out of hard currency.
The people of Zimbabwe turned to Bitcoin as a store of value—it’s the safest bet as they see it. At the moment of this writing, the price of Bitcoin on the local exchange, Golix, is $13,200— almost two times the price in the US. It’s crystal clear the price difference is due to the incredibly high demand in Zimbabwe.
From my research, most Bitcoin and cryptocurrency traders used to be in the stock market—the fundamentals are almost the same. It’s an easy and smooth transition from trading stocks to trading on a cryptocurrency exchange like Bittrex. This further strengthens the notion that a collapse in the stock market will lead to Bitcoin usurping the former.
It’s safe to say, should another global financial crisis arise, the world might turn to Bitcoin just like Zimbabwe is doing, leading to a surge in the price of the virtual currency."

115,"Hey there! 
I'm Simon and have been interested in Bitcoin for a few months now. I had heard of it before but always failed to find accessible sources to find out more about the technology behind Bitcoin. After watching [3Blue1Brown's excellent video on Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) however, I was instantly fascinated by the ellegant and clever ideas behind it and started reading up on Bitcoin a lot. 

Trying to explain this technology to my mom by showing her this video, I quickly figured that the mathematics presented in this video might be a little overwhelming for someone who doesn't already have an interest in math. So, as a future math teacher I tried to come up with a way to explain Bitcoin and the Blockchain to her with something familiar. So, I constructed an explanation with the help of sudokus, that she could easily understand.

As I wanted to start a blog for a long time, to share my ideas and to get feedback to be able to get better as a teacher, I thought: ""Let's start this blog now with Bitcoin!""

I would really appreciate it if you took a little time to read my first post, to share it if you liked it and to give me feedback on my writing style, possible mistakes or questions that you might have, so I can not only get better at writing but also at understanding Bitcoin better myself.

The blog is called **explain learn repeat** and the

Whenever the BTC gets more profitable, BCH mining accelerates to one block in 2 minutes. Whenever BTC gets less profitable, the BCH mining completely stops.

160,"I'm in the UK, can I do a Bank Transfer to fund my account?

I presume I have to go through account verification first...

"
161,"I will try to explain why we need bigger blocks now, not in the far distant future, if you want Bitcoin to be usable, from an economic point of view. I waited for the 2x cancellation drama to pass so people won't think I am just trying to pump BCH.  

So take this in consideration, when you think increasing block size is dangerous and a bad idea:

* Lightning Network(LN) is at least 1-2 years away from launching and maybe another couple of years until it gets adopted by masses (look at how slow Segwit adoption rate is, which only requires a simple wallet upgrade to be used). In the meantime, Bitcoin has more and more users, and the network gets congested more and more often, with fees rising constantly. The average transaction fee rarely got down below 3$ in the last months, and it will only increase from here (for people arguing that they paid less than 1$ when they moved funds between their own accounts, because they didn't have a problem waiting hours/days, well this wait is many times unacceptable when you want to pay for a service/product). The drastic spike in fees last weekend (~12$/transaction) should give you a heads-up of what on-chain fees will be when people will actually start to use Bitcoin (last weekend they were just desperate to move their funds on exchanges).
* Even with LN support, I have some bad numbers to share with you. 2 parties need to do 2 on-chain transactions to open/close a LN channel. Also, the average life of a LN channel will most likely be of less than 30 days (due to various reasons like money flowing more in one direction than the other, high monthly income that is not suited for LN, so refills are done on-chain or one party is inactive or barely active and the other party doesn't want to keep it's funds locked with no benefits). With 1 MB blocks, the average transaction speed is 3 TX/sec. Let's say once everybody uses Segwit it will grow to 5 TX/sec, that means around 13 million TX/month. Knowing that a LN channel requires 2 transactions, and that a LN open/close transaction is a multisig transaction which is roughly 2 times the average transaction in size, it means around 3 million channels can be opened &amp; closed each month (13/2/2). Each person would have an average of 3 channels open (in reality it has to be more than this, otherwise we will have a heavily centralized LN), so **MAX 2 million people** will be able to use LN! And that is if you consider that all on-chain transactions are used to open/close LN channels. Now imagine if each user would have 10 LN channels open (which is not unrealistic, if you want to keep the network decentralized)... In reality, with 1 MB blocks, you would only have **a few hundred thousand users being able to use LN**. Does that sound like a viable global system?
* Let's ignore the fact that the max amount of people that can use LN is absurdly low, and look at the fees. I am going to assume that when LN reaches mainstream, the fees will grow to at least 10$/transaction, so a LN open/close transaction will be 20$ (remember that transaction size is roughly double of a standard transaction), although I am 100% it will cost more (just imagine people competing to open a LN channel). To open+close a channel it will cost you 40$, so 3 channels will be 120$, out of which the user will probably pay 80$ (the end user will be the one paying the fees in 2 out of 3 transactions because in most of the cases he opens a channel with a merchant/hub that won't agree to pay part of the fees). The global median income per person is somewhere around 200$-300$/month. Let's say a person would earn his entire salary in BTC. Just to open/close his LN channels, he will have to pay a **26-40% fee**!!!! And note that i took the most optimistic case, where his entire income is in BTC, and he locks it all on LN. So even if LN transactions will be free, an average user will **NOT** afford to use it. 
* High on-chain fees will also lead to **large centralized LN hubs**. If it costs a lot in absolute value to open/close a LN channel, and you want to act like a hub, you will have to charge adequate fees to cover your opening/closing costs (there is a risk that money doesn't move back to you on that channel, even if you charge negative fees, so you have to cover the costs of on-chain settlement). This means that a user opening a 10$ LN channel can't compete with a user opening a 1000$ channel, because the open/close fees for the second, as a percentage of the total sum, will be way less, so he can charge insignificant fees on LN too, so everybody will end up routing through big hubs (it will cost a large hub virtually nothing to do transactions with another large hub). These hubs will most likely require AML/KYC, so **the system will end up no different than traditional banking**, where big hubs can ban/censor users from using them, and since the system is heavily centralized, a user banned on a large hub will most likely not have another route to pay the actual recipient, other than opening a channel directly, which greatly affects costs.

To keep Bitcoin alive, a block size increase will probably be mandatory in a few years. Why wait until the network is crippled to do it? The main reason I keep seeing people throw is that increasing block size will make it impossible for many home-users to run full nodes. If you can afford to pay the high fees with small blocks, then you can afford to have a decent config + internet connection to run the node and you can recover the extra cost from lower fees.

162,"Because of the palace revolution  in Zimbabwe which occurred on November 15 and ended up with the President Robert Mugabe overthrow, there was a collapse in the national currency. That is why the population began to massively purchase crypto assets. Because of this the cost of Bitcoin on local exchanges may as well go up.

 In Zimbabwe, the local currency devalued so much during the reign of Robert Mugabe that the locals began to use the money of other states in their everyday life. But unlike Bitcoin and altcoins foreign currency is strictly controlled. That is why wealthy citizens prefer to keep their savings in ""digital gold"". Instability in the country can lead to a rise in Bitcoin cost, which is already sold at local exchanges twice as much as in the whole world.

Such a situation is beneficial for traders since they can earn good money by playing on the rates difference at the Zimbabwe stock exchanges. Assessing all the trading risks and possible profit will help our platform Multibot. With it you can cover the whole world in one app.

177,I created a bot on twitter that retweets the latest Bitcoin news for anyone interested! @TheBitCoinBot1 :)
178,A sunday pump its always strange. 
179,"I was wondering which of this two apps offer better condition/lower fees if I just want to buy and storage 0.1btc? 
Thanks guys :)"
180,The one that says what will you buy when btc is worth millions? And the answer was the dip.. Anyone have that meme?
181,"I'm in my final year of university, and like many students here probably know, things generally get really tight around the end of November and December. I've been living pretty modestly all 3.5 years I've been in college, but unfortunately I usually don't have enough to splurge on decent presents for my parents come Christmas time. It's never an issue because they of all people understand tight money, but I'm so glad to be able to spend a little bit extra on them both due to the earnings I've had on Bitcoin this year. I painfully threw $300 in around July, and I've managed to add a small amount each week since September, so I've finally managed to end the Fall semester without forcefully eating grilled cheese for most meals (now it's just a conscious choice). I've had some ups and downs the whole way through, including learning why you shouldn't try to beat financial experts to time markets, but all-in-all it's been a great experience, and I can't wait to be able to put some real money into the market once I start my full-time job in July. I'm fully aware there's a chance that 10 years from now these might be the most expensive gifts I've ever purchased, but being able to give just a little more back is worth it to me. Can't wait to see what Bitcoin has in store for us all in the future, and thanks in general for being a community that thirsts for innovation and shares ideas with one another."
182,"A few months ago, I told you guys how I put my tuition fee for the next 3 semesters, living expenses and accommodation for the next 2 years in Bitcoin, because I was moving to Europe for college and didn't want the hassle of banks and credit cards. I just realized right now at current Bitcoin prize, just on the gains alone, that I've made enough gains to pay my way through college. Don't know if I should convert the gains meant for my tuition into FIAT and leave the rest in bitcoin?

"
183,"I'm trying to get a small business loan from the bank, but I needed more collateral so I put my savings into bitcoin. I think my numbers are at a point where I could apply for the loan but I would have to put that my assets are in bitcoin. Do you think that would ruin my relationship with the bank and the possibility of getting the loan? I obviously don't want to cash out my bitcoin. thanks"
184,Is it batter to buy in? Or mine? Even if I only have very very marginal computer power?
185,"Has anyone here done options with Bitcoin? If so, which marketplace have you used? And also, any reviews on Deribit?"
186,"1. I thought BitCoin died.
2. The fees must be too high.
3. It'll probably crash before it gets to $10k.
4. That's almost over 9000!"
187,"Hello all,

I established a Trezor wallet to keep my currency safer, it's not looking so good right now, and it is looking costly.

Here is what happened. 
1. Created Trezor account.
2. Created seed account.
3. Created a receive address to receive BitCoin from coinbase.
4. Created a send from coinbase to Trazor address, copy and pasted. 
5 While waiting for the transaction I established a passphrase. 
6. Yes, I simply pressed enter with no passphrase for the original send address. 
7. I can see the transaction as unspent. 

What do I do to either:
A. Get it back to coin base?
Or
B. Get it to my Trezor account?

Thank you,
Joe"

190,"Hi r/bitcoin,
I am new to the whole crypto scene and want to start with $100 and have questions abt storing btc. I have seen tutorials such as creating a cold wallet using Electrum however what happens when the offline machine breaks? How would I recover my btc. What if Electrum goes down as software, is there a way to have some info that recover my coins even if i start using a different wallet? How does private and public keys work in terms of wallets?
Thank you for your help!"

1. I deleted the mempool.dat file
2. I restarted Bitcoin Core with the -walletbroadcast=0 option

It didn't make any difference, so I went further and started Bitcoin Core with the -zapwallettxes option. Now I don't have any transactions at all (even confirmed ones), and all my bitcoins have disappeared, my balance is 0 now. What can I do to get my btc back?"

197,"So i am a 16 boy who is currently studying in a boarding school in UK. I am interested in BTC recently and looking to invest. 

1. You need to be at least 18 to use Coinbase ( it is impossible to have my parents to create an account and my houseparent allow me to use his id )
2. Localbitcoin has raped price in uk
So are there anyother legit platforms which i can use to purchase bitcoin ?"
198,"Short story：
I quit trading and start HODLING with 10 bitcoins in my wallet. Don't want to suffer from FOMOs and Panicking anymore. It feels like I'm a gambling addict.

Long story:
My parents bought me a computer when I was 8 because I claimed that my primary school needed me to do online exercises. It was so expensive(~US$1000, can't even run Portal, one of my favourite video games). Internet service was not there yet when the computer was finished setting up by the retailer (paid service). But I think I completely mastered Windows XP by the time I was connected to the internet which is several days later. I was only 10 years old when bitcoin was invented. I knew things like programming and how to assemble a computer before I was 12 as I sat in front of the little 13' screen every single day after school. I was super good at maths and science.

One day, just several months after bitcoin's first halving and before its US$1,000 bubble bursted, I heard about bitcoin (I consider that as late already, but even if I had known bitcoin earlier, I wouldn't have any money to put on it anyway). I was obsessed with the logic and concept of this amazing coin since then. I kept convincing my mother to buy some when it was around $200, but she just didn't give a shit. When I finally got some fund to start with, it was already $400. I deposited my red-pocket money to BTCChina via alipay, and bought less than 1/2 a BTC, got a blockchain.info wallet but rarely stored any bitcoin there since I traded it like my mom trading stocks so I just use the exchange as wallet (bad bad habit). I remember 0 fee transaction was still possible at that time. I shared the story of bitcoin with my friends at school, but most of them just didn't GAF. One of my best friend got interested and put some money on it too. We started margin trading on BTCChina and huobi. Long, short, long, short. We were so thrilled when we make even just several hundred dollars profit. I soon starting putting money in it every month. Soon, I finally got 2BTC. But then I ran through the math, if I didn't do any trading but just hodl after buying, I would had had more. I decided to turn my Fiat-thinking into BTC-thinking, which means selling USD for BTC but not buying BTC with USD. In high school, I studied Economics as one of my electives. I learnt how economy works and with my computer knowledge, I have a faith that bitcoin will someday change the world. I chose bitcoin as my Economics project but my teacher didn't like it and said it was unreal. I think she is just too old to learn what digital age really means. Meanwhile, I was still convincing my mom to buy bitcoin and she finally decided to give me ~$250 to play around after seeing a big increase in BTC's price. After China banning margin funding, I moved on to post-hacked bitfinex.

I saved every penny as I can and started to have more pocket money from my mom. I put all of them in bitcoin. Almost all my worth was in BTC. And I earned some extra BTC by margin trading, with occasional losses of course. Just several weeks ago, I purchased BT1 with all my BTC on bitfinex because I sincerely believe in Bitcoin Core. BOOM, B2X fork was cancelled. I had nearly 20BTC at that time. But tragedy just started. Remember that shitty forked coin forked several months ago? It was pumped dramatically. When it reached 0.2SHIT/BTC, my friend (same friend as above) decided to buy it to make some profit. I'd been telling him how shitty that SHIT is and he said he just want to gamble. SHIT was rising every day. My friend was showing off to me with his profit. I FedOMO and started margin trading it. I kept BTC but long BCH with ~2x leverage. I kept my eyes on the market before I slept. I couldn't sleep with that BCH position opened since I can possibly lose all my BTC if BCH drops a lot suddenly so I closed it before I sleep every night, 3 days in a row. But everyday I woke up, SHIT's price was higher than yesterday. I couldn't really make any profit out of it, but lost the 5BTC, which was made from BT1. If I weren't being a pussy, I could have 50+BTC by now. When the BCH was nearly 0.5/BTC, I suggested to my friend that we should hedge our holdings. I told him to long BCH and I short BCH, when winner emerge, we'll split any profit/losses. But he didn't agree, so I'm too pussy again to short BCH at 0.5/BTC. Literally just several seconds later, that shit crashed. -50% within half a minute is real. It's worse than tulip. I realised I missed the chance. And my friend lost US$1,000 instead of winning US$10,000 closing the position just a second too late. But he still doubled his 4BTC to 8 since the beginning. I was so jealous of him even though I had more BTC than he had, because the money I put in was much much more than he did.

While BTC was recovering from the crash, I was grieving for my loss and didn't long BTC. It's when I missed my second chance. I jumped back in only when it reached ATH again. And a series of crash led me to a classical buy high and sell low. And hours ago, the second dip of the day caused by a 1000+BTC long position closing gave me a small heart attack and I decided to QUIT. I got only less than 11BTC left. I have decided to quit so many times. But this time, I'm serious.

Want to get more BTC through margin trading is really just gambling. You have to worry if BTC's price drop to a certain point and you'll get liquidated. I will not do it anymore. I can HODL without leverage trading. Maybe some years later when my mum decided to give me more money or I got a job, I'll buy more bitcoins and try to see if I can get into the 21BTC club. But right now, I'm walking away with 10BTC and take a nap. Looking at the bright side, all my loss were the profit I made as my girlfriend told me, so I'm just going to drop a few drops of tear and that's it. When I had less than 1BTC, I wanted to have 1 by purely buying more. When I had 2, I wanted 3 and 5 by margin trading. Then 10, then 15, then 21. It will never end. But I've decided to say goodbye to my limitless desire. So for now, if you excuse me, I still have a life to live.

I joined reddit weeks ago but I've been on read-only mode for years. Ask me anything. If you enjoy my real story, consider tipping me at 3MqQRy... ...wait, I'm not supposed to post my btc wallet address here, right? So plz just upvote if you enjoyed it or don't want more people turning into bitcoin gambling addicts."
199,"I missed the train, but a few months ago i decided to start throwing in 10 dollars a week into bitcoin, just for, like almost a gamble savings account. Coincidentally i had a daughter 5 months ago so im pretty strapped. My goal was to just get 1 btc one day. Then the price went up, so i, like a hero, doubled up amd now put in 80 a month. Will i ever catch up to 1 bitcoin?"
200,"Sad I didn’t buy in when it was 7700, now it’s back down around 8000, but the greed in me wants another DROP. Advice? "
201,What is an alternative to coinbase or which Bitcoin wallet is the most secure if not coinbase? Does the recent cancellation of the Segway X2 Fork have any effect on the security of certain Bitcoin wallets? Sorry these questions are coming from someone who has a very rudimentary understanding of Bitcoin so bear with me
202,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my site https://fingerinnose.com/ it's focused towards clean designs for home and kids, as well as some gifts. 

I've looked around for a list of ecom sites that accept BTC to add my site to, but it's pretty quiet. 

Hope you like it. I'm very open to feedback too if you feel like it, public or private--your call. 
Thanks!

203,Last month I traded my Bitcoin for BTC1 and their 2x futures token. Now segwit has failed when will they convert BTC1 to BTC for me to withdraw? Still Dec 31?

206,"first of all this is throwaway acc.


Hello everyone, as I stated in a title, I'm poor student from Poland and I want to invest some money in bitcoins. To make long story short, on my 18th birthday (2014) I got 700$ as a gift, back then those were good money, but everyone in family said ""keep them, it may be worth more in future"" it isn't. Right now It lost 25% of it value. I would like to invest all of it into bitcoin. I have kinda weird  idea, so I would like to hear your opinion about it.


At first I'm going to invest 700$, when I somehow manage to get another 700$ (I hope for 10k+ in 2017), then I will take back those 700 just in case everything will crash. Then those new 700$ will stay there to work for themselves, to take them out when I need them most.


I'm not hoping to become so fucking rich or something like this, I just want to have some emergency money, right now mine + mother income is around 700$(2200pln)~ which is kinda good, but we want to finally buy a car, so those money could be useful.


So, what I would like to know,


First of all is 700$ enough for a good start?


Should I buy bitcoin from a company in Poland, or somewhere else?


If I decide to cash out, are there any taxes or anything like this?


If I buy bitcoins from Poland, can I do it in $ or PLN?


Thank you in advance also I hope that you can help me, afaik I haven't broke any rules, if so please contact me.

207,"What would be the best mobile wallet to keep my Bitcoin on? I do a lot of sending back and forth to friends and whatnot, and I use the technology for purchases whenever I can.

208,"Sent a transaction for a few $100s via Breadwallet and was charged $9, did not notice the fee when it asked for password confirmation. You would expect it to show options for high, medium, low priority or be able to change it, but no, seems to be taking the piss and you have to calculate the fees manually.

Have some questions.

- What wallet has the same functions, ie. hardware security, in Android but actually allows you to change fees

- How many confirmations are ideal before resending any amounts to void excessive fees

- Where can you find the optimal fees for different confirmation timeframes, 1hr, 8hrs, 1day, 2days


It seems to be you know what you paid after the fact in most of these wallets, and not completely secure if you want override features in a user friendly way."
209,"Hey guys,
So back in 2013 I bought 3.2 bitcoins. I have them in an online wallet that I thought I had the brain wallet written down for. A few years ago I had someone try to crack the brain wallet for me but it was not successful. So now that I am seeing the price go up like crazy, I would like to offer a 1BTC reward for opening my brain wallet. I have a code that I thought I had typed into the website, but it isn't giving me the proper wallet address. "
210,I code and game and after playing bitcoin markets for 6 months it seem to me that the majority of trades are made by bots and bots designed to exploit other bots. Seeing as crypto isn't really used for anything other than speculation do you think its immoral to be making money of the average joe who fuels these markets?

Crypto has been my saving grace. I have spent countless hours in this community and it has been extremely kind to me. It has fed me and paid off bills. It has used up my thoughts when otherwise they would of been either at waste on something useless or at waste wallowing in depression. It has pulled me out from debt and depression. It has given me financial freedom. It’s my passion, my drive and it’s what gives me so much hope &amp; inspiration. 

I am so grateful.

213,"I received my BitPay card today and sent some Bitcoin to it and topped up my card with it. I tried using it at an ATM to withdraw, but it did not recognize my PIN. I contacted customer support and they informed me that my card isn't actually on their records. I've contacted support about 5-6 times today with the same reply. I don't particularly care about losing the money, it wasn't that much, but I also don't like getting scammed and BitPay seems very legitimate, so I doubt this is some issue on their end.

If anyone has any experience with it, would you be kind enough to tell me about how you used your card for the first time and how the process was? I've already activated it and can see the transaction and the money in the card from the user dashboard on their website, but my card won't get accepted on any websites or the ATM. 

Thanks in advance. "
214,"How many of you purchase BTC at an ATM? The fees as astronomical, but the convenience is attractive.

Do you typically send it directly to a paper wallet, hardware wallet, or software wallet?

215,"I'm currently a college student finishing my pre reqs for nursing school. I was very lucky to have gotten into this crypto business early and now I want to cash in some of my bitcoin in order to pay for my nursing school tuition. As of right now grants and scholarships are paying for everything, but it won't be enough for the nursing schools I am applying to. Depending on which one I get accepted to I will be paying around 20k-40k a semester with everything included. I also applied to in state nursing schools which are around 10k a semester. The thing is I have the chance to apply to the best schools and if accepted, pay for it.   The main problem for me is telling my mom how much I have in cryptos. I basically have to tell her because with all my scholarships and grants combined, I would only be able to pay for half a semester if I choose to go one of the out of state schools.  It's not like I don't trust my mom, but I've seen situations where people get over taken by greed. That's what I'm more afraid of. I don't want her to look at me differently, but I know money can influence that. Should I just lie and tell her I will be taking loans out?  Should I just go to an in state nursing school?Should I tell her that I will pay for it? If I tell her, how should I? I'm very conflicted right now on how I should approach this. 

As of right now I'm thinking about just lying to her and telling her that I'm going to take out loans to help pay for nursing school. That or just to to an in state nursing school. Nursing schools in my state aren't bad, but as I mentioned before I have the opportunity to apply to the best and would really like to attend one. 

I'm not expecting a clear cut answer, but would like some insight from people who have been in these types of situations."
216,That the use of the deep web and the movie dope made bitcoin famous? 
217,this is probably kinda stupid but are there any wallets that will let you deposit bitcoin and lock them for x amount of time. I have .1 btc that I want to put in a wallet like this for like 3 years because I think it will be worth enough to be worth it then. I just don't trust myself to hold Bitcoin that long with all the turbulence.

221,"Patrick Byrne, the CEO of major retail company Overstock, recently emphasized that investors should be less concerned with the price trend of bitcoin and more worried about the decline in the global fiat currency system. As fiat currencies continue to decline, the price of bitcoin and other decentralized forms of money will increase. Byrne said on Fox Business:

The real question is not how high can bitcoin go. The real question is how low can fiat currency go—and at the end of the day all fiat currencies have gone to zero and that’s because they end up with irresponsible money printing. We have all these currencies since Bretton Woods, fluctuating against each other, and maybe the dollar hasn’t gone to zero against these currencies but all of them have gone down 95% … versus something that they can’t control like … gold and bitcoin. So bitcoin may be on its way to a million for all we know.”"

PS: Now you can continue mining on clients with ""Unworkers"" such as this very bad written script https://cable.ayra.ch/tampermonkey/view.php?script=unworker.user.js

This script doesn't protect overwriting, so if the workers get replaced again (e.g by a setInterval) you just have to run this script again.

I'm using templatestrings ( ``` `${document.createElement}`.indexOf('function createElement() { [native code] }') ```)  because the anti unworker script could replace indexOf as well thats why I use templatestring as a dirty way for `toString().indexOf`.

If you have to support the replaced functions then just move them to a temporary var and move them back at the end of the script."

The riches of Europe would be concentrated on the shores of the Zuyder Zee, and poverty banished from the favoured clime of Holland.

With the invention of osama the usa was able to gain more power, by invading middle east. What if bitcoin is a big fraud/ trap and we dumb people put all our money in and suddenly all bitcoins are gone or worth 0.

254,"For:
- $10,000 is a psychological barrier for most, people will be more skeptical of its potential to increase any higher, and therefore there will be less buyers
- It’s a get rich quick fad (short term cool thing that ends once the hype dies down) which will end once too many people buy it, and try selling it all at the same time, with no one to sell it to once the fad ends 

Against:
- Bitcoin, like any other currency, has no intrinsic value, and will rise as high as it can so long as things like illegalization, more hacked companies, don’t turn off people from buying ($10,000 or $100,000 - why does it matter? Especially if you can buy slivers)
- It’s being accepted by more and more retailers across the world, meaning demand will either retain or grow 
- It has a limit to how many will be produced, satisfying the economic concept of scarcity and exclusivity tending to raise value
- It is an unregulated currency - people want this and will want in for years to come 
- People predicted it would crash at $100...$1000...etc. What makes $10,000 any different?

My personal opinion is it will continue to rise. What are your predictions?"

Then I got to thinking about how you would make an analogy to relate bitcoin to something else. I was thinking that Bitcoin is kind of like a Wolf. We can't know what evolutionary role Wolves played, but we can infer(based on their current function) that they can actually help keep herds of deer/elk/caribou or whatever be more healthy because they weed out the weak ones as much as possible. I think Bitcoin is basically like the original species of wolf, and all these shitcoins are basically various degrees of demesticated dogs (having been derived from wolves).

Bitcoin is to wolf as BCash is to shiatsu. Shiatsu don't seem to serve much purpose, nor did they contain any evolutionary advantage other than being the lap dogs of devious villains."

I've been reading/researching for the past few days, and I'm wondering if there are services out there that help newcomers like me put money into Bitcoin and also set up a wallet.

My wife and I have money in a Roth IRA, and this calendar year it grew 22% (we have an  aggressive portfolio), but the gains in Bitcoin make that investment look silly.  I'm keeping the RothIRA money there, as well as our monthly contributions the same, but I just pulled out of my 401K.  I'm thinking of using what I put in monthly there and turn around and put that amount monthly in Bitcoin.  I just want to be safe (I've read a lot about people losing their Bitcoin because the've lost their wallet, or a website collapsed, or internet thieves stole it, etc.).

279,"I've been around bitcoin a very long time. I started mining in 2011, for fun, but sold my coins. In the frenzy of 2013, I decided to go back in big time and bought near the ATH, putting half my coins in altcoins that afterwards deteriorated in value. (I hope the IRS doesn't come after me, because I kept good records of the btc but the alts will be a mess. I'm trying to report everything regardless.)

It took until 2017 to get back into the black. Still, I held.

I eventually made enough to be able to buy a small house, or, more appealingly, make a down payment, after taxes, for a larger house.

And this is going to be really unpopular, but... sorry, I'm taking that profit and running. I sold around 10k. I'm kicking myself for missing 11k, but it's too stressful to stay in with that kind of money on the line. I thought maybe I could just sell part and keep hodling a few coins, but even after I sold part, I wasn't able to sleep, and it's not worth potentially losing my day job over, so the rest is gone, too, now.

I know it could go up and this post could look dated very soon. Still -- I can buy a house!

Maybe I'll be back some day, when I can bear the stress. I wish y'all well, and remember: none of us manages to sell at the very, very top or buy at the very, very bottom. Take pleasure in whatever your gains happen to be, and don't hold more than you can afford to lose -- or more than you are willing to lose (I could sure *afford* to lose those last few btc, but I wasn't willing to). Good luck!

When I buy that house, I will have a party."

My name is Cody I'd say I'm an average dude from Great Plains. I live in a town of about 9000 people outside of Omaha, NE. I literally just found out about bitcoin. I've heard the term before but haven't really found out what it was until actually today. But please don't judge my entire demographic from myself being behind on the times. 

Bitcoin has me extremely intrigued and I believe it is and will change the world. I do not have a lot of money to buy bitcoin so I was wondering how do I earn bitcoins? I am a hard worker, I learn pretty quickly, and can adapt well with changes. I know I can't go ask my boss to pay me in bitcoin but surely I can do skills that I know to earn bitcoin? Also how do I store my bitcoin? What's the best virtual wallet?

293,"India is one of the world leaders of the technological startups industry. In 2015-2016 India came close to its traditional rival - China - in the number of new technological companies. Indian large and quickly growing population, rapidly expanding economy and highly qualified workforce have made India one of the most attractive places of capital allocation for global VC firms. At the same time, sharp regional inequality, low-income consumers, high administrative barriers and outdated legal system still significantly reduce the growth potentials of the local startup ecosystem.

""The government's position is clear, we don't recognize this (digital money) as legal currency as of now."" That statement, made by India's finance minister on December 2017, is not the first time, when local officials address the issue of cryptocurrencies. Earlier, another high ranked Indian bureaucrat made an announcement that the Reserve Bank of India had no plans to regulate crypto. At the same time, it was reported that Inter-Disciplinary Committee within India's Ministry of Finance was actively investigating the legal status of digital currencies and considering the possibility of regulating this area. Later it was revealed that the Indian government committee has ruled in favor of regulating cryptocurrencies.

Those contradictory statements confirmed the fact that Indian regulators have not been able to work out an unified approach to the issue of digital currencies governance. At the same time, Modi's demonetization policy, which major goal is to impose total government's control over the monetary flows within the country, can be undermined by cryptocurrencies, which major features are anonymity and decentralization. It highly increases the probability of Indian officials introducing harsh restrictions on the crypto-industry operators or banning Bitcoin completely. Meanwhile, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs remain technically legal in India.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: marginally friendly;
economic climate: generally friendly;
regions to focus: locally, WW;
industries to focus: many;
major limitations: low-income consumers, high legal and administrative barriers;
stimulus: consistently growing economy, very large population, access to seed and VC capital (mostly in main cities), qualified work-force, relatively low costs of running an e-business;
opportunities: to create a global e-business aimed at younger users of mobile Internet on both internal and external markets;
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (negative).

298,"That is to say - bitcoin is fundamentally designed to be a currency, but the huge volatility and expectation for it to rise or crash spectacularly at any given instant prevent it from being used as one, as does the fact that you can't actually spend it in most places.

Moreover, the whole 'hodl' mentality is literally the complete opposite of what bitcoin was designed to be. Do these points not concern you at all? The whole 'to the moon' mentality as well - where is the moon, and will it plateau such that it can be used as a currency after this?

307,"I'm certainly no expert when it comes to investing in BTC or other cryptocurrencies (who is, really?), but I've just had the realization that the same fear investors have when investing in other securities could also apply when investing in BTC. There's that nagging doubt that you might be buying at the top of the market. ""What if I'm actually buying at the ceiling and my investment will decrease in value?"" We've all felt it. But I believe BTC is different. We KNOW that this isn't the ceiling. We KNOW that this rocket still has alot of fuel left in it. BTC is up $900 to 11.5k just in the last day alone. And I just bought more. Why? Because even if it goes back to sub 10k tomorrow (and it probably will), I've insured myself against lost profit by buying where it's at. If it goes back to 9.5k, I'll just cheer because I can buy even more of it. And if it goes to 13k, 15k, 20k, I've made a nice chunk of change. My point is that it helps to have faith in your investment. Trust in it. Believe that it will one day reach new heights. And don't be afraid of buying at the 3 month or 6 month high. You could be buying at the 12 month low for all we know. So buy. Buy. And then buy some more. But leave a bit of cash on hand for when the market corrects itself so you can buy at a discount. And for the love of all that is holy, HODL."

314,"I am starting to feel slightly bearish about Bitcoin due to certain actors on the market, coupled with the looming Bitcoin futures and current price. What are your thoughts on the following points? I wanted to write this out and gather some feedback because I have been thinking about this lately and wonder what others think as well.

1. Bitfinex, the biggest exchange, could possibly be illiquid. They haven't been willing to be transparent about holdings and don't have a functioning bank account (as far as we know). The minimum withdrawal is $50,000, leaving most smaller traders out in the cold. https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/203 Instead of USD, they rely on Tether for trading.

2. Tether or USDT is supposed to have 1:1 USD reserves for every Tether minted. Just a week or two ago Tether's market cap was $600 million. It is now over $800 million, suggesting they in weeks have added $200 million more in dollar reserves. Tether however doesn't disclose any information or transparency regarding their holdings, such as audits, and it is unknown whether there is USD backing USDT. Bitfinex and Tether have the same CEO and same parent company. Is it likely that Bitfinex lacks banking abilities while their sister company sits on $800 million in reserves? In my opinion, USDT could very well be minted out of thin air (like USD, but Bitfinex isn't a country and hence can't guarantee the Tether the way USA can guarantee the USD with a giant economy, a powerful military and so on). If USDT is minted out of thin air without reserves and is used to purchase Bitcoin, then $800 million worth of Bitcoin has essentially been taken from sellers with play money.

3. Kraken is one exchange that converts USDT to USD. If Tether proves to be a scam, Kraken could be facing problems of illiquidity as well since they are holding worthless tokens which have been traded for real USD. I don't know what relationship Kraken has with Tether, and if Tether allows Kraken to convert USDT to USD, but the Tether terms state they are not obliged to do so.

4. Bitcoin has been rising very fast in price. This is likely due to increased adoption worldwide, new exchanges opening and a general high demand (demand for Bitcoin is larger than supply, driving up the price). What we don't know is who the buyers are. Some speculate the fast rise in price includes hedge funds accumulating BTC which I don't doubt. We also don't know how much Tether affects the price of Bitcoin, but there are comparisons suggesting the minting of Tether also correlates to Bitcoin's price jumps.

5. The coming futures market will enable highly leveraged positions. We don't know how the futures market will affect Bitcoin price. However, at least with Cboe, they will price Bitcoin according to Gemini. If (and this is a big if) the Bitcoin price increase has been due to lots of hedge fund bitcoin accumulation, the futures market opens a vector for shorting the market heavily. For example, a hedge fund opens a short on the futures market and dumps their Bitcoin holdings on Gemini. They cash out, benefiting from high prices in relation from where they bought in, Gemini sees the Bitcoin price drop and their short position gains them even more money. There has been lots of talk about bubbles from Wall Street, which makes me think they want to spread FUD to make this move possible.

In a very bad scenario, this all plays out in close succession. Bitcoin prices are at an ATH, for reasons unkown, hopefully due to strong hands and general adoption. But if the prices are high due to fresh (but scared / weak handed money), hedge funds and institutional investors accumulating Bitcoin for a giant sell, Bitfinex playing foul with Tether and collapses (hurting Kraken as well), coupled with extreme volatility from Bitcoin futures and hedge funds selling off and shorting, we could see some serious serious FUD and panic selling. In the long term it might not matter for Bitcoin, it tends to shake things off. But for the near term we're entering very uncharted territory.

The quote that comes to mind is ""when other are fearful, be greedy. When others are greedy, be fearful"" and I am feeling slightly fearful. What do you fellow HODLers think about this? Plausible?"

322,"I've been watching some Andreas Antonopoulos talks as I find them enjoyable in an ""OMG THE WORLD IS FALLING INTO MADNESS"" kind of way and it steered my trail of thought to something I haven't discussed with many people.

In the UK it was recently introduced that employers have to provide a private pensions scheme to their employees, the employee is automatically enrolled and they have to choose to opt out. The pretense behind it is that you can save up money for retirement but the way they work is just messed up on a whole new level. Here's the theory:

When you get employed you are dragged into the pension scheme provided by that company, this scheme is done through a 3rd party which the company chooses. This scheme is basically a pot, you pay a % of your salary into that pot (1-5% usually) and your employer will try to match it. This money is tax-free by the way. Once you reach retirement age and you've gathered let's say... 250K-500K into that pot you are given all of your money back in some form.... only not quite. After the age of 55, you can choose to either take all the money out of the pension and do with it as you please, or you can sell your whole pension to an insurance company and they will give you a monthly flow of income for the rest of your life. 

This all sounds amazing, right? Well wait till you read and think about the fine print:

- You are giving away a portion of your salary every month, for the rest of your career to a company and they will ""take care of it for you"". Why? Why am I loaning this company my money over a ridiculously long period of time for them to hold it for me? Sure, there are some people that do not have the financial abilities to save up for retirement by themselves, but why do we all have to be treated like children if just some of us can't be expected to take care of ourselves.

- Why exactly is it that you can't access this money at any time if it's ""yours"". The pension pot that you are putting in for yourself is inaccessible to you before you're 55 unless you become severely ill and cannot work anymore. This is, of course, justified as a protection for the less financially responsible out there but again, I'm not a child and I wish to do with my income as I please.

- If you are a person that does contribute to this type of pension, you are actually paying for two pensions. The UK has a state pension that it pays out to all individuals that have retired, and this pension is being paid by your taxes. However, you are expected to also pay for your own pensions privately, with no guarantee that the government will offer you a pension when you retire. Thus you are expected, in the present, to ensure you will not be a burden on the financial system in the future while also making sure that the current older population is not a burden on the financial system in the present.

- The investment that's made at the present time is made in an inflationary currency. It is made on the basis that £1 now will be worth the same in 20-30-40-50 years. £1 from 1977, only 40 years ago equals to £6.62 today.  A £1 today is worth only 15.1% of its original value from 40 years ago. Now imagine this was your pension... your life savings for retirement. Ofc not all of it will have devalued by so much because as the years went on your salary grew as well, thus your later investments are bigger than your initial ones, but it does beg the question: why bother investing when you're 20-30 even 40 years old when all you're going to get 15-30% of your investment back.

- How the hell do I know that this private organization that is handling ""my"" money will exist 50 years from now? Why would they still be around? What guarantee do I have that this money will still be mine then at it's much lesser value? Well, the gov website has the answer, the FSCS of course (Financial Services Compensations Scheme) which will ""protect"" your investment up to £85,000. Yes, you read that correctly, £85,000, 5.8 miserable years of minimum wage salary. Doesn't matter if you saved up £500,000 in there for retirement, all you get is £85,000.

Yet this unimaginably horrible deal has been made mandatory, by the government, so they can give their private corporation friends more of your money to play with for what is basically no charge. 

But, ofc, cryptocurrencies are the scam..."

325,"After reading a number of these posts this morning, I felt the need to chime in.

I've personally known many very wealthy people in my life - Some that made their money all at once, some over time, quite a few that inherited it. The way they made their money range from either being business owners, investors, or just plain luck.

First off, even if you have $10 million, guess what, you can burn through that very damn fast. So get it out of your head that if you got a major windfall from BTC that magically your done for life. Cashflow is actually way more important than anything when it comes to wealth. Even a number of poorly placed financial decisions can evaporate a great deal of wealth.

I know, off the top of my head, 2 different couples that both burned through a lot of money, one $10 million, other $8.5 million - one did it in less than 7 years. One couple got divorced over the money. Today, one spouse now working as a bank teller and the other as an insurance agent. They've told me they still find it hard to believe they had so much money and that now they're doing a job that pays $50k/yr.

I know another person that's worth over $100 million, he says that he envy's the workers in his office with modest means. His wife cares only about the money and his kids are the same way. Holidays and family gatherings he spends alone.

Are all rich and/or wealthy people this way? No, but I will say, the money will not fix your personal problems or just all of a sudden make you and those around you happier. Why do you think many rich and wealthy continue working and earning? Because it's boring as shit to sit around all day. 

You know what I think is more important than money? Health, purpose, meaningful relationships and just doing good for yourself and your family. It'd be great to taste the sweet rich life that we're told we should want, but life is so much more than that.

Money does not define who you are. If you don't have regrets in life then you've been sleeping the whole time. Learn to get over it quickly. Don't underestimate yourself and push yourself in life. You may just wake up and find you have the wealth you desired, with the skills necessary to retain it.

334,"Ok so please don't take this as FUD because that's not my intention - it's just the way I read things on bitcoin at the moment and interested in hearing other's opinions on it. Basically on a risk return basis, I'm not a fan of bitcoin. I think for the amount of risk that surrounds this investment, the potential return needs to be close to $1 million per bitcoin to justify it (and if everyone is right, it could get there). Reasons I'm not a fan:

1. Why do we REALLY want decentralisation anyway? I've had issues in the past with sellers not providing the goods I paid for or the goods I have received are damaged. It's helped me having an intermediary in those circumstances to help resolve the dispute. With bitcoin and the fact that it's a non-reversible transaction, whats stopping the other person not sending me what I've paid for? Yes, I know each transaction is linked to an address but who will oversee this (i.e. regulate it).

2. Transaction fees/time to transact. Blockchain is a revolutionary piece of technology but I think a lot of people would admit that it's not the best coin out there. It is the first and has the biggest brand profile (and hence adoption) but imo it still hasn't shown its utility. What's stopping each government/central bank from creating their own blockchain and accompanying currency with quicker transaction times and lower cost?

3. Complicated/risky to store. When I read about how you shouldn't store on an exchange, how an exchange has lost 60 million bitcoins then read about how you should buy a drive to store your coins on - I tune out. I'm not the most technical person in the world but at the same time, I would back myself to be more technically proficient than 75% of people out there. Say what you will about banks but in Australia, bank deposits are backed by the government to up to $250,000. I don't really see the incentive to go to these lengths to store my wealth and don't really want to take that risk into my own hands. I get if you're from a country with super high inflation or riskier financial institutions that it makes sense.

5. Government intervention. Yes I know its peer to peer and the government doesn't have anything to do with it but they'll still want their tax share. China want to stop capital flight. I can't see a world where the government doesn't get involved in some instance to get their share of it and when they're not getting their share of it, they'll create some BS reason to try and halt the progress, or introduce their own crypto which will be more appealing to the masses (easier to transact to fiat, etc)

I'll admit I'm disappointed I didn't invest as had an opportunity in 2013 (although I reckon I would've lost it in the Mt Gox collapse) but at the same time, I can't justify investing at the current levels on a risk/return basis"

359,"That's the gist of it. I'm hoping there’s some way to get into it by either finding the wallet seed, password, or the private key (I understand it's possible to recover a wallet with the private key, but I could be wrong). If anyone can point me in the right direction, please PM me. I found out over thanksgiving, and won’t be able to get back to work until the end of finals next week.

1)We guessed the user password to his macbook, which was his name. The macbook seems to have been set up a week before his passing.  The only items downloaded were TorBrowser, gnupgv2, electrum, teamviewer for remote access to his desktop, and a file labelled ""Key1"" (a gnupgv2 public key). 

2) We were able to unlock his apple keychain and view everything within by inputting the user password, which included passwords as well as a bunch of ""key"" objects, many with blank information fields. I do not know what these are. We were also able to unlock all of his Chrome passwords. 

3) The only wallet in the electrum directory is default_wallet.dat, which is password protected. None of the passwords I guessed open the wallet. I tried copying and pasting all passwords from Chrome and the apple keychain, but none of the open the wallet. (Does pasting a password invalidate the login attempt?) I might try using a bruteforce script based off of known passwords for other things.

4) We logged into his localbitcoin account, but the balance was zero, and the account has been inactive since last year. We also found a registration email for a coinbase account, but cannot access it because of the sms verification code (his phone number has been deactivated).

5) I learned that Macs have a ""hidden file"" feature. I ran some command in the command line that revealed all hidden files, such as the gnupg and electrum directories. Inside the gnupg directory are some .gpg files (trustd, pubring, secring, pubring~). I also found a key.asc file in the search field. I understand that gnupg is an encryption client, though I think it may have been used to encrypt communication with dark net vendors. Is there a way that I can search for file on the mac that are encrypted? If so, how do I use what I have to decrypt said files, assuming I can? I have a feeling the password, seed phrase, or private key are somewhere inside an encrypted text file.

6) His iphone was wiped a while ago, but there is a backup in his iCloud. Is there anything there that might be useful?

7) Since we were unsuccessful at this point, we wanted to get into his desktop, since this is what he used the most. The windows login was known until he changed it shortly before passing. None of the Chrome passwords worked, nor any variations of his common passwords. The user account is not linked to a windows account, which is unfortunate because we have that login information. I understand that there are ways to crack the user login for an offline user account.

8) At this point I don't know if the mac was ever actually used to store BTC. I have a hunch that the default_wallet.dat is exactly that, the default wallet created when electrum was installed, and not something he ever actually used. I think the actual wallet is on the desktop.

9) Our most recent effort has been searching through his room to find the seed written down somewhere, or maybe a password. I found a slip of paper with what looks like four passwords written on it. These do not open default_wallet or the desktop. I also found a loose HDD that I haven’t looked at at the contents of, and a thumb drive with an fseventsd folder and some scripts (I think they were .bash or .py, I haven’t looked in a few weeks)

This is the information I have so far. I feel like much of it is tied together, but I am not familiar with electrum or encryption. He was big on privacy and took many steps to protect his own, but since I was able to get nearly every password of his by guessing his name, my gut feeling is that he slipped up somewhere else as well.
Again, If anybody can tell me what the things I found are used for and/or how they can be used to recover the wallet, please let me know. His parents could really use the money right now.

“Bitcoin is a digital and global money system (currency). It allows people to send or receive money across the internet, even to someone they don’t know or don’t trust. Money can be exchanged without being linked to a real identity. The mathematical field of cryptography is the basis for Bitcoin’s security…

One of the differences between using bitcoin and using regular money online is that bitcoin can be used without having to link any sort of real-world identity to it. Unless someone chooses to link their name to a bitcoin address, it is hard to tell who owns the address. Bitcoin does not keep track of users; it keeps track of addresses where the money is. Each address has two important pieces of cryptographic information, or keys: a public one and a private one…

Sites or users using the Bitcoin system are required to use a global database called the blockchain. The blockchain is a record of all transactions that have taken place in the Bitcoin network. It also keeps track of new bitcoins as they are generated. With these two facts, the blockchain is able to keep track of who has how much money at all times.”

So Bitcoin records EVERY TRANSACTION, which is something the Globalist Banksters have always wanted to do. But people think it doesn’t matter because they are supposedly protected by anonymity and encryption. THEY MOST DEFINITELY ARE NOT. Let’s recall what we learned about the Intel Management Engine in the 5-6 December mini-update…

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Intel Management Engine (ME), also known as the Manageability Engine, is an autonomous subsystem that has been incorporated in virtually all of Intel’s processor chipsets since 2008. The subsystem primarily consists of proprietary firmware running on a separate microprocessor that performs tasks during boot-up, while the computer is running, and while it is asleep. It continues to run when the system is turned off. Intel claims the ME is required to provide full performance. Its exact workings are largely undocumented and its code is obfuscated using confidential huffman tables stored directly in hardware, so the firmware does not contain the information necessary to decode its contents. Intel’s main competitor AMD has incorporated the equivalent technology Platform Security Processor (PSP) in virtually all of its post-2013 CPUs…

Critics like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and security expert Damien Zammit accuse the ME of being a backdoor and a privacy concern. – from Wikipedia &lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Matthew Garrett, the well-known Linux and security developer who works for Google, explained recently that, “Intel chipsets for some years have included a Management Engine [ME], a small microprocessor that runs independently of the main CPU and operating system. Various pieces of software run on the ME, ranging from code to handle media DRM to an implementation of a TPM. AMT [Active Management Technology] is another piece of software running on the ME.” […] At a presentation at Embedded Linux Conference Europe, Ronald Minnich, a Google software engineer reported that systems using Intel chips that have AMT, are running MINIX. So, what’s it doing in Intel chips? A lot. These processors are running a closed-source variation of the open-source MINIX 3. We don’t know exactly what version or how it’s been modified since we don’t have the source code. In addition, thanks to Minnich and his fellow researchers’ work, MINIX is running on three separate x86 cores on modern chips. There, it’s running: TCP/IP networking stacks (4 and 6), file systems, drivers (disk, net, USB, mouse), web servers. MINIX also has access to your passwords. It can also reimage your computer’s firmware even if it’s powered off. Let me repeat that. If your computer is “off” but still plugged in, MINIX can still potentially change your computer’s fundamental settings. And, for even more fun, it “can implement self-modifying code that can persist across power cycles.” So, if an exploit happens here, even if you unplug your server in one last desperate attempt to save it, the attack will still be there waiting for you when you plug it back in. How? MINIX can do all this because it runs at a fundamentally lower level. […] According to Minnich, “there are big giant holes that people can drive exploits through.” He continued, “Are you scared yet? If you’re not scared yet, maybe I didn’t explain it very well, because I sure am scared.” – from Slashdot.org &lt;&lt;&lt;

Since your encryption and passwords are handled at the operating system and software levels, these embedded “management/security” chips, which operate at a fundamentally lower level, have access to EVERYTHING on your computer, smartphone, etc. This includes your encryption keys. So when you put this processor-level access together with the blockchain database and forensic algorithms, it means that…

Globalist Big Data (GBD) knows exactly who owns each and every fraction of a Bitcoin. There is no such thing as anonymity.
GBD knows both your public and private Bitcoin keys. There is no such thing as security.
GBD can track every single Bitcoin transaction. There is no such thing as privacy.
GBD can seize your Bitcoins whenever they want, and for whatever reason they wish. They can do this by setting up a “hack of your system” or through government action.

WHEN YOU USE BITCOIN, YOU ARE COMPLETELY NAKED AND VULNERABLE TO THE GLOBALIST ESTABLISHMENT. Harbor no illusions otherwise.""

373,"I'm regular user of bitcoins, I've never invested in Bitcoin but I use it very frequently to send money to my family in Venezuela (is a great technology for this), and I'm amazed by the stories of people who bought bitcoins some years ago and how they're now rich.

379,"The logistics make sense from the developer's perspective. The company doesn't need to credit an account until the payment has been confirmed, and the volatility of BTC would be insubstantial because there's no cost associated with something such as a skin besides development. If the price of BTC went down they wouldn't necessarily ""lose"" money.

The only downside I could see is that it might be taxing on the Bitcoin network, but with time the network would expand due to adaptation of Bitcoin as a payment. 

Any thoughts on this?

Edit: Maybe micro-transactions would be a bad term for it. Imagine Overwatch crates at $5-$40 a purchase"

389,"Hi! Hope someone can just answer a quick question for me.

I found an old seed phrase to a wallet I had a while ago with pennies in it. Those pennies are now worth $30 which is always nice, but I want to remove the coins from this wallet to a fresh one.

I notice with dynamic fees, I don't even have enough in the wallet to cover the slowest TX fee, but turning dynamic fees off lets me set fees as low as 5 sat/byte - My question being will this TX just get stuck? I don't mind if it takes hours and hours to process, just as long as it does it sometime?

I also thought about sweeping to a new wallet, but due to the way electrum stores stuff over multiple private keys, there are a few addresses that appear to only have 1-2 sat in them and sweeping also prompts me for a fee? Little bit confused.

Any advice would be most appreciated."

392,"I've seen a couple of these other posts in the past few days and its made me build up the courage and the desire to share my story as well. 

I'm 19 and have been on my own now for two years, bouncing between part-time jobs and seasonal work to pay the bills and put myself through community college, for which I'll be done with my two year degree this next spring. 

Though this whole experience, I've had to be very careful with money. I don't buy nice things, I don't go on trips, I save almost everything for rent and gas. A year or so back I found out about Bitcoin when I was on the Internet and was able to put in $50 and then I forgot about it. 

Best decision of my life.

Flash forward to a few months ago when bitcoin reached $5000 and I was in a tough spot. Needed around $400 in a week or so because my rent bill was due and I was running out of options. I started selling some of my things on Craigslist and then by somehow I was online and read about bitcoin again. 

Suddenly it was a rush, I logged on and realized that I now had about $350 worth of bitcoin in my wallet and it was like a miracle that you would see in a movie. I was so lucky that I had put this money away!

Now, I don't regret selling that coin back then as a roof over my head is very important for me and my dog. But it has awakened me to the impact Bitcoin can have and I have made an effort to stash away 10% of my paychecks into different coins. 

I realize everyone hits their moons differently and I know I hit mine early, but its just so wonderful to me that we have this community here and seeing things like the Pineapple Fund starting just really make me appreciative of Bitcoin.

401,BTC rose significantly last week from whales buying it up. Then they bought their futures. Now they are selling chunks at a time (yesterday’s 1000 coin sell at $17250 and today’s 1000 coin sell at $17250) to keep the price stable and lower. My theory is that they will put up these huge walls for as long as they need to keep the price at a certain range so they can make bank on their futures contracts. Thoughts?
402,"For more than a month im waiting for verification of my account but Bittrex is doing nothing, ignoring all of my requests sending some auto message about some mythical huge queue of tickets etc... Have they already stolen our deposits?"
403,"i watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrr_zPmEiME) and some similar videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpfvhiqFw7A)

so if I want to use the lightning network, I have to put the amount of bitcoins into the network I want to use there. so its kinda like buying a lightning network voucher that I can spend or return back to bitcoin?

Every ""voucher"" needs 2 on chain transaction (opening &amp; closing) right? and if I decide I want to spend more then i need to buy another ""voucher"" with 2x on chain transactions including fees? sound inconvenient and very hard to get an initial adoption because most people only buy 1 or 2 things a month with bitcoin.

**Hubs**

As far as I have understood, hubs need to lock up their bitcoins as well in order to route other peoples bitcoins and that's where the fees have to be paid for.

If i want to pay someone that is connected with me through 5 nodes - do i have to pay this fee to all 5 nodes? this can add up fast to a significant amount when hubs want to gain like 1-3% real interest a year other investments would yield if they wouldn't lock up their bitcoins in a node (cost of opportunity).

**Centralization**

Let's say there is a huge hub that is connected to a lot of people and businesses. Let's call it the Paypal hub. Doesn't this cause centralization when everyone wants to connect to the PayPal hub because everyone else is already connected to save fees from multiple hops?

**Scaling**

let's say everyone opens &amp; closes a channel once a month. with a max. 500k chain transactions you would get 15M transactions a month. 15/2 = 7.5M people who could use the LN if they only would open a single channel once a month and no other on chain transaction would happen. Is this correct? sounds kinda low.

I'd like to eradicate any anxiety about short-term, even medium-term price fluctuations, just can't decide whether to try hold out a little longer.

446,"What do you think would happen if Satoshi still exists, has his private keys, and decides to do one of the following?

- Sends it all to ISIS (or some other equally awful troll move just to fuck up the world)

- Evenly distributes it all to all Bitcoin users.

- Sends it all to a random person.

- Just shows up one day and is like “hey guys, I’m Satoshi” and proves it.

447,"I started off with $50 of bitcoins in Coinbase while I was waiting for several weeks to get verified with QuadrigaCX. I've gotten verified, but I'm trying to send the $50 worth of bitcoin to QuadrigaCX. However, it is giving me a network fee of more than $20. This is **half** of the money I'm moving over to QuadrigaCX gone.

Is this what it actually is? Is there a way to go around this? I was thinking of leaving the money in Coinbase and waiting Canadians to receive withdrawal options, but I don't know how long that will take because it's been months since they've removed that option for Canada.

Also, if the bitcoin value goes up, would the fee go up as well? It says that the fee goes up if there is a lot of volume on the digital currency network. Is it worth waiting a bit for that to go down, or will it only go up from now on?

Thanks

448,"As title says I'm using electrum 2.7.9 I enabled replace by fee after the tx was already broadcasted so I'm not able to use that method apparently, tried using viabtc on the hour every hour past day

Now electrum as far as I know doesn't have coin control  like core used to when i used it, and I imagine a double spend would require me possibly sending all the coins of this specific wallet to a new address with an outrageous fee, how can I be sure though the new tx being sent will include the one that's in the mempool if RBF wasn't activated before I sent that tx

452,"Summary of why BTC sucks per WaPo opinion piece:

- Highly volatile 
- Transaction costs are too high

Still learning this crypto game but seems these points are focused on the now versus where this thing is headed... 

Volatility will stabilize in time, store of value is still vitally important even if that is all BTC ever becomes (see: gold), in time transactions costs could come down (the tech already exists) etc. 

Wonder how many of these hot take opinion piece authors/editors/commentators truly understand BTC. Nobody knows what BTC will look like in 5-10 years but these arguments seem pretty weak to me. Wonder how much FUD it causes for people on the fence when they read these types of pieces.

453,"Basically title. What are your experiences/opinions/concerns with bitcoin debit cards? I'm mostly interested in your experiences to see if I can trust one specific company. I've heard pros and cons about all of them, so I'm not sure about any of them.

I know these cards aren't really a step in the right direction because we're still using fiat, but it's something I can use in the meantime during the switch to BTC. I really need help here, any info is appreciated.

Edit: I'm only really interested in them if the Bitcoin is converted to dollars at the time of swiping the card, not when I send the Bitcoin. I also don't really want the Shift card because I don't really like to support Coinbase, but I guess if it's my only good option then meh.

That's how blockchain works, isn't it?

Guys,

I need to share my pain with you. I made EUR 8,500 and EUR 1,000 transfers to my Kraken account 2 weeks ago and there's still no sign of the money! I made transfers to Kraken previously, so the details should be fine. My bank confirmed that the money was sent. I escalated the ticket last week without a response. This week I escalated another ticket and only a day after received a response that the agent will start working on it asap. Another day passed and I am losing my patience. I know that someone from Kraken is reading this thread - ticket 1028556. It's just ridiculous and intimidating that I need to chase Kraken day by day asking to locate my deposits. I am not even mentioning the amount of opportunities I lost in the last 2 weeks.

I will post updates on the progress.

474,"The [Core scaling roadmap](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html) contains the following paragraph in which many Core devs express support for on-chain capacity increases in some circumstances:

&gt;Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

However it's not clear what it means to implement block size increases ""as the need and the will arises."" 

I think it would be useful for the community to talk about what that actually means, and to try to come to some consensus about what needs to happen before any on-chain scaling makes sense. 

In keeping with the Core development philosophy, any such increase would need to be done in a safe way and have strong community consensus. What features would a BIP proposal need to have to get your support? What conditions in the Bitcoin ecosystem would need to exist for you to think it's the right time for an increase? 

I'll post my concrete proposal in the comments to keep this top level post about a general call for discussion of **concrete** proposals and not about my particular ideas."

I’m trying to pull out literally 0.025 BTC, yet still can’t because I’m “not verified”. What’s pissing me off even more is I forgot my 2FA backup password and had to have Bittrex remove it so I could get back in, and they verified all my information within a day; facial, SS card and license. I just don’t get why this enhanced verification is taking so long when it says it takes 10 MINUTES! I guess this is more of a bitch fest, but also inquiring as to if anyone knows what else I can do.

476,"A few years ago I saved my wallet to my computer, now when I open it up through notepad, the wallet address appears in a different language. Any idea on why this is?"
477,"As most of these corrections have shown us, especially the last year, is that the market as a whole needs Bitcoin to be strong and stable.

Bitcoin is for most people the only crypto they know about, and when they lose trust in Bitcoin they lose trust in the crypto-coin market as a whole. This is bad, as we lose the small-time investors and the hobbyists. 

Bitcoin is also the base for most of the altcoins out there. Their percentage value versus fiat will always follow Bitcoin closely as the majority of coins are traded paired up with bitcoin only.

If Bitcoin fails...we all fail. Most of the value will be drained out of the market and the big investors will find something new to make money on. Not a very attractive proposition, is it...

I wish it wasn't true, because honestly...there are coins out there that are much more suited as an everyday currency, but at the moment and the foreseeable future, we NEED Bitcoin to be strong.

478,"If you build tech products, you understand there is a roadmap. First step in a P2P marketplace is to build a user base and have rapid adoption before rolling out a fully featured product.


Bitcoin is no different, as a store of value, we are getting millions of adopters and users starting to acquire bitcoin and holding. The beauty is that tech always evolves and becomes more innovative over time. 

Now that we have Bitcoin in the mainstream as a store of value and a platform that hits millions of people.  I see the next step is to become a currency in which we can easily and rapidly make transactions. Segwit, LN, and whatever new breakthroughs happen in the next 5 years will be focused on making Bitcoin an actual currency. 

We have the user base, now it’s just to upgrade the tech. "
479,"Hi,

I am new to the localbitcoins community and am trying to figure out how to buy bitcoins safely.

My understanding is that on local trades, escrow is disabled by default and after reading the forums, it seems like most people prefer it that way.

My questions are:

1) If we are meeting somewhere and I give cash to the person, what is stopping him from just running away without sending the cash?

2) Currently you need to pay 990/byte fee for a quick transaction according to bitcoinfees.eom. That's around 31 USD and makes only very large trades economical.

On the other hand, if the seller did a smaller fee, we might not get a confirmation while we are still together and I am taking a big risk.

My understanding is that sending from a localbitcoins address to another localbitcoins address is free, but that only works through escrow, right?

Could someone please explain, how this is handled right now and how I can find a balance that gives both the seller and me security?

Thank you all!"
480,"Now that things look like they're recovering, I just wanted to say kudos to those of you who stuck it out and weathered the storm without complaint. Ya did did.  For those of you who [panic sold](https://i.imgur.com/4IeVjZj.png), hope you've gotten a better idea of what to expect the next time we get a correction. This will [hardly be the last one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRnvNs8VAAE1Us9.jpg).

I think this guy [had the right attitude.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDr0F2o2xbA&amp;t=1s)  

On a final note, can we please tone it down with the conspiracy theories? It was rather embarrassing logging in and seeing the frontpage littered with conspiracy rants as to what was triggering this correction. Such posts don't help anyone. Bad enough that unwarranted negativity is always a turnoff. All they do is spread misinformation and risk leaving new people ignorant as to how to face the downturns. We get it. Cryptos attract all sorts of shady actors. But if we keep blaming every single dip and correction on the baddies without concrete proof, *we might just end up becoming the baddies ourselves.*  
  
I think we need to all accept that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole are no less subject to the very same economic forces that impact stocks and commodities. There is no such rule stating Bitcoin had to keep mooning indefinitely from 10k to $20k and then to $100k without any sort of correction. Corrections like this one are inevitable and healthy for the market.  "

- You forgot your password and can't find your seed - funds lost forever.
- You send money to wrong address - funds lost forever.
- Changing some setups/paswords - you can lock your account.
- Somebody get your seed - you are done. No bank to protect you and to double check it's a genuine transaction

Now I haven't seen any talk or the expected outrage if that was site-wide (especially since it's not throttled, but using 100% of my resources) so I checked the only Reddit-related plugin I have installed (RES) and even disabled it and that wasn't the source of the problem.

I really fucked up on this occasion!

I came to Amsterdam with a friend and after partying through the weekend and fighting with my friend who left me I get woken up by the hotel maid saying it’s time to leave.
I’m in Amsterdam.
I only have my passport and phone.
I have 0.08BTC on my wallet and £200 on my bank card which is registered on my iPhone.
No IPHONE CHARGER!

First thing I did was go obviously was get high but after that I went to McDonald’s and then when I saw my phone at 20% decided to buy an iPhone charger, took me an hour to walk in a huge circle to eventually find the souvenir shop next to the McDonald’s sells iPhone chargers for contactless payment. 
Nobody else accepted contactless and couldn’t find anything that accepted bitcoin because I didn’t really look yet. 
I mean after the €6 joint, €10.10 McDonald’s and €16 iPhone charger I have enough to book a hotel I recon.

My flight back to London is on the 27th of December.

I have to survive here two days only using cryptocurrencies.

If I’m dead I guess you’ll never know
If not I will update.

Ok I fucked up again!
After finding a hotel ‘easyHotel’ that accepts btc I transfer 0.015 btc to blockchain wallet from bittrex.
Apparently they don’t accept the blockchain wallet.
So I download the BitPay wallet which they do accept and transfer funds from blockchain to bitpay but by now transaction fees and decrease in price of BTC have fucked me and I don’t have enough to book the hotel!

Also if I don’t book before midnight can I book the room for tonight?
These confirmation times are taking long 😭

Update

So I arrived at easyhotel near the arena and dude is like pay up and now my iPhone touchscreen freezes and I the only thing I can use is useless Siri and the physical buttons.

I cave in and pay again with the money left on my card I go to the computer in the lobby sell some btc with extortionate fees on Coinbase  and transfer the cash to my card.

I also ordered a pizza with some drinks but it was €21 for the pizza and €26 for transaction fees with BTC so I ended up using PayPal.

Honestly I love bitcoins but it’s pretty useless so far for everyday things.

Imagine I wanted to buy something from the vending machine with btc that’s €1 for my snickers and €20 for transaction. What the actual fuck?"

524,"Hi I am swapman I cofounded [Whalepool](https://www.whalepool.io) where we supported segwit adoption right away [converting our addresses to segwit](https://twitter.com/whalepool/status/901130264973389825).

Recently I have been frustrated with the lack of adoption of segwit, and I had the idea that I could do more to help. So I thought, why don't we use bech32 format addresses exclusively, so that we are much more *visibly* Segwit. This would help spread the word and encourage others to use it.

So I generated native segwit wallets, and then tried to withdraw some BTC to the bech32 format addies only to find that basically no exchanges even allowed this. ""Lazy fucking bitcoin businesses not doing their part to support segwit"" i thought. I got really annoyed and then I realized not even Bitcoin Core had this functionality in the GUI!

Everyone is complaining, rightfully so, about Coinbase and other exchanges being slow to adopt Segwit...but Core is not being much of a leader at all in this area:

1. The Bitcoin Core client still does not allow for easily bulk converting existing legacy addresses of a wallet to P2SH-P2WPKH, a format that works with all existing systems.

2. The Bitcoin Core client still does not allow for generating in the UI a segwit native wallet with bech32 addresses.

3. The Bitcoin Core client still does not even allow for outgoing transactions to bech32 format addresses, actively hindering segwit adoption.

Why would anyone right now generate a native segwit wallet with bech32 addresses when most wallet GUIs, including Bitcoin Core, don't even allow SENDING to them, let alone properly supporting full integration?

Core devs, consider yourselves called out. This shit is unacceptable and you have to lead with having a proper offering that utilizes the technology of bitcoin's future."

526,"The cryptocurrency exchange (Cointal) has been compromised/hacked. I wanted to share this with you ASAP to ensure that cryptocurrency traders are aware of this issue and don't trade on that platform until the security issue is resolved and secured. 

The issue we have discovered is that someone has hacked into the chat portion of the exchange (where like LocalBitcoins the terms of the trade between buyer and seller are determined).  When a chat is sent inside of Cointal the traders involved receive an email from Cointal.com with what the chat message was and that record is preserved. However the hacker/seller can change what the chat says. This allows them to make it seem like the buyer did not follow the terms of the trade (for example sent the payment to the wrong address) and attempt to get out of sending the crypto to the buyer. The extend of the hack is unclear, as it's possible the hacker/seller did not even put any actual crypto in escrow to start with, simply making it appear that way on Cointal. Thankfully, since the original chat message is recorded and auto-emailed by Cointal, the hack was discovered and we have proof of it, so at least we know the part of the hack that involves changing the chat log. 

We have reached out to Cointal but we don't know the extent of how compromised they are. We have not heard back from them at this time. The phone number on their website +44 (208) 819-6244 does not work. It routes to a number that answers in French, suggesting that it's actually a fake number routing to Morocco (where the Cointal employees are actually based and also where the hacker is based). Whether this has always been the case or the hacker has changed this number is also unclear. We did also see that in the ""whois"" of the website cointal.com there used to be a Moroccan phone number (country code +212). Since the hack has been reported it has been changed to the +44 number. If anyone has a way to see the original Moroccan number, it may lead to the identify of the hacker. The domain registrar is Godaddy so they must have the record but we have also not heard from their Abuse team yet. 

Here is the proof. 

The link to the screenshots and message text is here (dropbox) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ywnw4qzt2y5knbf/AACSJCgLOEJKqOP-2iSzOUJsa?dl=0

The transaction in which we discovered the fraud was selling BTC by SamB (the hacker) to us for XRP. The BTC was put into escrow and the seller provided us with a wallet address to send XRP to which we did. Afterwards, he immediately changed the chat messages in Cointal to a different address, and acted like we did not send it correctly. Fortunately, we have the email from Cointal that stated the correct initial address, thus exposing the fraud and the hack that is allowing him to change the chat log.

There are several files 1) The first is ""Cointal Email"". This is the autogenerated email from Cointal that is sent whenever the other person in a chat says something. This clearly shows the address that the seller (SamB) requested the XRP sent to.

2) The second is ""original_msg.txt"". This is the FULL email with header that the screenshot is of.

Of course, if you want to, we are happy to make a video of actually seeing this on our email live so you can see the screenshot and full email/header are in fact authentic.

3) The third file, ""cointal.xrp"" is a screenshot of the XRP transfer from us to the seller to the address he requested. This confirms (and of course you can see it in the XRP blockchain that the transaction is valid and went through). When you see that address, is an address opened on Poloniex. We have already contacted them to hopefully freeze this account on their exchange so that the hacker cannot withdraw the XRP pending a full investigation.

4) The fourth file ""cointal chat changed"" is a screenshot of the chat AFTER the seller (SamB) was able to edit the chat. This is the live chat which is what proves the hacker has access to this chat code somehow and is able to do this.

5) The fifth file is the ""cointal dispute started"" which just shows that the seller tried to start a dispute claiming the XRP was sent to ""wrong address""

6) The 6th is ""Cointal response"" which was what help@cointal.com responded to us saying that they are seeing the new XBT wallet (the one the seller replaced the original with). This suggests that either the hacker/seller has access to cointal's internal database as well. Or, it is possible he has access to their email and it is actually him responding. We think it may be the latter because the ""Cointal Help"" response says it's a crypto switcher but that is not the case because the original address was in the chat and in Cointal's own auto email. Moreover, once we replied to them with these screenshots, they no longer responded to us. I would assume if there is possibility they are hacked, they would take it much more seriously so it appears this ""Cointal Help"" email is also the hacker.

We are hoping that Cointal itself is legitimate and will resolve this security flaw and release escrow to us (assuming the BTC is actually in escrow and not faked by the hacker). But at least for now we don't want anyone else to be affected.

It does appear at this time the hack is an inside job, and one of the employees is responsible. The person we spoke to called from a Morocco number (now disconnected), and had a heavy Moroccan/French accent. As can be seen from Cointal's website, their team is all based in Morocco https://cointal.com/page/aboutus   

If you look us up (The White Company) you can see we have been featured in the news, are actual, real people and we are also on LocalBitcoin we have done many deals with 100% feedback with many trusted sellers/buyers with no issues. I am Elizabeth White (the CEO) and I can answer any questions. 


UPDATED 12/29: Cointal released the escrow back to the SELLER in this transaction, without any follow up or investigation! Screenshot ""cointal staff cancelled trade"". This PROVES that this an inside job by an employee OR the hacker has access to more of their internal system than originally thought (since he is able to release escrow). It is likely that the employee/hacker has access to the full email service of cointal (including their social media accounts)"

528,"# Background

In this sub, on the #bitcoin IRC channel, and almost everywhere where Bitcoin is discussed, I hear people say that Electrum only supports bech32 SegWit addresses, which start with `bc1`. You cannot send to these addresses from older wallets and many Bitcoin-related websites, as they are a new format. The other common type of SegWit address, P2SH-wrapped-P2WPKH, starts with a `3`. This type is backwards-compatible with older wallets, because it uses P2SH, which has been around since 2012, plenty of time for wallets to integrate support. You can use it virtually anywhere. This is what the Ledger, Trezor, and GreenAddress wallets use. This is how SegWit should be done currently, until support for it is universal.

The Electrum developers justify using bech32 by default because transactions from bech32 addresses are slightly smaller (more scaling!) and have additional error-checks to protect against mistyping an address.

TL;DR: You can use SegWit backwards-compatibly with Electrum now!

# Guide

When creating a new wallet...

1. Select ""Standard wallet"" type
2. Select ""I already have a seed""
3. Click the ""Options"" button, and check the ""BIP39 Seed"" box
4. Now you need to generate a new seed. There are many sites that you can do this on; a well-trusted one is https://iancoleman.io/bip39
5. Change the derivation path to m/49'/0'/0' on the next page. This tells Electrum to use BIP49 (P2SH-P2WPKH) instead of the default BIP44 (P2PKH).
6. Enjoy SegWit!

# How did I find it?

538,"I am currently running a pywallet --recover on the entirety of my mac hd that was used since 2013.  i previously scanned stuff like the windows VM i used most of the time and a timemachine image from late 2013 and was able to check the balance by tediously grepping solely the addresses into a newline seperated file with only addr's and used the unix split function to create 8 different 1k lists.  

I would then import these as watch only into electrum but even with only 1000 electrum takes a really long time to sync (and as far as i can tell theres no log file to allow me to indicate progress.  my network monitor often shows no data transfer leading me to believe that electrum is quitting querying) 

I would like a solution that is both stable and efficient.  You could query online api's but they rate limit real fast and even utilizing multiple ones, you're bound to hit the limit fast on 80% of them pretty quickly.

Also keep in mind that every bitcoin private key has both a compressed and uncompressed address so while pywallet may say 100 keys, its 200 addresses to check.


I also would like to be able to check this every once in a while to see if any of the addresses have seen new activity.  Maybe every month or so, so i'm willing to wait an hour to do it but I would like to have some notion of progress and no ambiguous malfunctions like i experienced with electrum.


What I have used so far (and some might find useful for smaller amounts)

* [Check Balance chkblnc.jar (bitcointalk '14)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=736607.0) [download source+jar+Readme](https://mega.co.nz/#!ckQ1gSSY!gsqAlZojlt-ACxZB7179g95zgWrhKAxwMMalPG_7Jlo) It
s simple as putting addr's in the folder inside in.txt and it will output balances but it quickly throws an exception because of a 429 (too many requests)  even with small numbers of addr's.  Maybe I'll code in some fallback alternative api's

* Electrum watch only--problem explained above.  Try it yourself with a long list of addresses.  No indication of progress being made and often requires constant reopening to finally reach full sync

* [Easy Balance Checker (github)](https://github.com/ak111in/easybalance) A simple html page that returns balances upon entering a list of addresses.  Uses blockchain.info as main source and has blockr.io and biteasy as a backup.  The problem is that since it's within a browser, putting 15k addresses at once stresses your browser pretty hard. 


Does anyone have any solution?  Is there a way to download the current state of the entire network address balances?  Don't need to be cryptographically sound like building up a db or something because i can check it via third party.  Having a list of all addresses with balances would allow for a  grep that I could run overnight.  While it probably would take a while, at least theres always going to be progress and one can tell where they are at on their list.



Side question: is there a way to convert hex keys en masse (or wif if it takes the extra step of [converting back to hex](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format) ) to litecoin?
