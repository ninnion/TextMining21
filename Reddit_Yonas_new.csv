This time I can't do anything, and did some reading here, and tried the test web page a fellow redditor posted here a while ago. I can get in and see my balance, but it won't recognise a balance. Anyway I can dump my coins and get them back?  There's about 75usd in it. Any help greatly appreciated. Thank you"

I understand why but still, not even a single place will take my money (one place took my $13 and ran off with it).  Any suggestions on what to do or where to go or even anyone who wants to take my money ($57.26) for bitcoins??

Thank You"
1002,"I used to be a daily trader but i lost couple bitcoins and i realised that daily trading could be pretty risky. I guess those of you who tried it are aware of that.

In meantime i noticed an ad here at /r/bitcoin about the [SecureBitcoinWallet](https://securebitcoinwallet.net/) and their investment program, so i decided to try it. It turned out to be a long-term investment (but much safer than my old daily-trading job).

I created a [Secure Bitcoin Wallet](https://securebitcoinwallet.net/) (approximatelly 25 days ago) and i joined their investment program (into level 2). 
So far i got 1.5% interest rate on my initial investment of 40 BTC and i intend to get 10% more in the long-term (within 6 months).

Here is my advice for you: don't be a daily trader and stop trying to make money fast, instead take the longer and the safer path. It takes more time but it brings decent return and it is much safer than daily-trading.


Good luck!"

1012,"Yesterday the Estonian Supreme Court ruled in my Bitcoin case.

The state and some media claimed that the court decided to treat Bitcoin like any other economic activity, but this is not true.

The court decided to apply extra regulation to Bitcoin trading that does not apply to other economic activities. Including the requirement to meet customers in person (face to face), as well as the requirement keep IDs of ALL customers and report those who trade more than 1,000 Euros more per month. No other economic activity is subject to such strict requirements, the normal reporting limit is 15,000 Euros not 1,000. Estonia is also the only EU country to apply special strict requirements to Bitcoin, most other EU countries, do treat Bitcoin like other economic activities and do not impose extra strict regulation.

This ruling not only applies to Bitcoin, it applies to all blockchain tokens and assets, the only requirement being that the token or asset can be exchanged for fiat currency somewhere.

I think it's safe to say that Estonia has now confirmed that it is the worst country in the EU to start a Bitcoin or blockchain business.

As a bonus, the court also decided that I do not have the right to silence and that I must provide information that could incriminate myself.

So besides being hostile towards Bitcoin, blockchain tokens and assets, Estonia is also not respectful of fundamental basic human rights.

1014,Is there anything you can do to expedite the process? They were pretty vague when i asked. Is it necessary to upload photo ID etc?
1015,"Congratulations to you. There is Bitcoin magazine and nothing else. The vast majority of Bitcoin news website that I'm aware of are terrible, really terrible, shameful actually. They make Bitcoin look amateurish. I cringe everytime they appear in my google news feed.

Cointelegraph had nice pictures but poor content. I think it's controller by Dash/Darkcoin ? Many dodgy articles, the rest void of any interest.

Coindesk looks pro but has very poor content. The problem is the people writing there. Except for a few guests doing their promotion maybe..

Most of the others are used for shady opearations, their sole function being advertising the scam the week.

Hopefully now that it has been acquired by Barry, Coindesk will try harder. He needs to fire everyone who has touched this and hire or pay some real freelancer editors/bloggers. People with actual knowledge in economics or the technology. Or any talent for writing something interesting at least."
1016,"Okay, here me out. What if ...

We could make a monetary system where each unit has an expiration date. However, that date is variable. The countdown gets reset every time the currency unit changes hands. The goal of this idea is to prevent economic stagnation and the stockpiling of wealth. Basically, it would make trust funds impossible. Obviously there would be lots of loopholes, like trading money between you and your friend every however often to reset it, but ignoring that for now .... This could be practical to implement with a cryptocurrency. Thoughts? What would be other benefits? What would be the downsides? I don't know how long the expiration date should be, or whether it should be constant or variable depending on the amount saved or the state of the economy .... just brainstorming at the moment.

edit: I'm thinking the expiration date would be on the scale of decades."
1017,"I continually see people """"buying"""" &amp; """"selling"""" with exchanges, though they know of others who are as well.

If I could advise people to do one thing that would help them, and Bitcoin, it would be to try to find as many people as you can who will accept Bitcoin from you, either for their goods or services, or in exchange for other currency.  We don't need brick &amp; mortar businesses to accept bitcoin, though that would be nice.  Just find a few people who might be willing to exchange in or out of bitcoin on occasion.  Do this before using some centralized solution.  Tell others to find at least a few, but the more the better, to do the same.  Think about that which you can exchange bitcoins for without converting to another currency, and on the other end, accept bitcoins for your goods/services, and try to find others who will exchange for whatever your local legal tender is in a pinch.

Every time someone asks about using Bitcoin to send funds to X, the first thing we should tell them is to make sure the people receiving funds in X are looking to use them, or exchange them for what they need/want directly *first*, and only exchange into other currency if they must.  Of course it likely won't be easy to find those resources immediately, but if everyone is constantly looking for more people who will accept them, the more efficient this process can be, and the more valuable bitcoin becomes.

I'm so sick of people answering """"but how can I get money with bitcoins?"""" ignoring the fact that they questioner isn't getting that bitcoin is money.  Its usage will grow with our effort to make it grow, or will stay limited to services which keep us dependent &amp; lazy if we refuse to find mutual bitcoin users.

I tell everyone I give bitcoins to that they're welcome to ask me if they want more, or would like to exchange out of them, and that they should find at least 2 others that will accept them as well.  I hope everyone will start advising something like this."
1018,So what are your thoughts? will it rise due to the restricted supply of new coins? Will the market pre-empt it and we see no change? or will it fall for some other reason?
1019,"I was in the San Francisco Bay Area around the time Uber started.

I was an early adopter of the app, at the time called UberCab (later renamed to Uber due to regulatory concerns)  and exclusively enabling booking black cars (limos).

I remember that I immediately became addicted. And I remember that some of my friends wouldn't even give it a shot on the basis that """"cab companies would eventually shut  it down"""". I remember hearing hypotheses like """"The yellow cab mafia will surely stop it"""".

Obviously history shows that didn't happen. I think one of the key reasons is that it was *so obviously superior to everything else* that even if you were a politician trying to block it you would think, on the back of your mind, """"I really need this service"""". No matter how much money was at stake, something so obviously good, so obviously futuristic, can't be stopped.

Before Uber was too big in size to fail, it was also too amazing to fail.

Bitcoin Influencers from throughout the Texas Triangle (meetup groups from Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, &amp; Houston) have joined forces with innovative bank-free Bitcoin exchange [Wall Of Coins](http://www.wallofcoins.com) to form **Cyberfunks, the Alliance for the Unbanked.**

We've united to produce our inaugural event, """"Bitcoin Awakens"""" on **Saturday, July 9th**--the weekend of the Block Reward Halving, [""""The Halvening""""](https://www.kaiko.com/bitcoin-clock)

*Suspend Your Disbelief...*

It's Bitcoin literacy couched in fun-filled adventure as teams re-create scenarios from the Star Wars Universe, scouring the city of Austin to solve Amazing Race-style challenges related to Bitcoin/Blockchain technology.

*Decentralized We Stand; Centralized We Fall...*

Successful challenges will receive clues leading to the location of one final ordeal and a victory party in honor of the mysterious creator(s?) of the Bitcoin Protocol. 10% of proceeds go directly to **Capital Area Food Bank of Austin, TX**--the first food bank in the nation to accept cryptocurrency.

So join us for a great time on with an authentic, grass roots, family-friendly, """"Be Your Own Bank"""" experience!

1037,"A few months ago when Craig Wright first leaked documents to news outlets to attempt to out himself as Satoshi, it came to light that his company was the recipient of [$54 Million in R&amp;D subsidies](http://www.grantcentral.com.au/big-numbers-involved-in-rd-tax-incentive/) from the Australian Tax Office, for which he was under investigation (and later had his home raided).  In order to qualify for the subsidies, Wright claimed to have spent millions of dollars on R&amp;D.  However, his company did not spend a cent on R&amp;D.  He claimed that he """"signed over the rights"""" to millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to a third party, and that it was spent on R&amp;D.  This was detailed in a company document.  (The document was taken offline.  If someone happened to save a copy, please post it.  It used to be here:  http://demorgan.com.au/assets/150511_demorgan_54mausindustryrebate.pdf).    

In this document, he allegedly """"signs over the rights"""" to his satoshi coins to a third party, which could (conveniently) only be loaned back to him for R&amp;D purposes. 
Also, like a child, he calls out the person who is investigating him from the ATO in this document.  Paraphrased:  """"See!  I told you I was Satoshi!  Now get off my back"""" https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644014-Tulip-Trust-Redacted.html 

Are you starting to see the motive here?

Long story short, the Australain government wasn't buying the story that he was satoshi nakamoto and that he spent millions of dollars worth of bitcoin on R&amp;D.  His only way out would be to somehow convince the ATO that he is in fact Nakamoto, and does in fact own the bitcoin that he claimed to spend on R&amp;D.

When asked about this in the BBC interview, he made it seem as though the Australian Tax Office was investigating him because they wanted him to pay taxes on his alleged bitcoin holdings.  This is 100% false.  They are coming after him for claiming to own Satoshi's coins and spending them to get a large R&amp;D subsidy. The fact that he misrepresented the situation rather than addressing the actual issue when asked about it in the interview is *very* telling with regard to his likely motive.    "
1038,"24 hours later when I've seen hundreds of posts explaining why Craig is not SM there's no word from Gavin and he's still being quoted at the """"bitcoin expert"""".  How long before he finally puts and end to this or is he just trying to stir things up like with his other attempts over the last 12 months. "
1039,"Gavin Andresen is a small dude who has suddenly found himself thrust into the centre of a big picture, with many players vying for his attention. He is also naive. And bankers, law enforcement types, politicians and lawyers come to him smiling with good manners and sweet words.

He sees himself as some closeted libertarian ninja silently advancing the Bitcoin agenda while working with regulators to better sway their opinion by offering up his assistance, demonstrating good intent. All without realizing he is educating the sharks.

He says that we need to get the masses on board, because then we will be protected, and that it's OK to compromise so that we win these gains. It's a typical herd mentality of frightened sheep flocking together waiting to be slaughtered. What Bitcoin needs are strong individuals willing to stand for their rights and take initiative.

Then there are the """"fringe elements"""" of Bitcoin who call him out, and they are a threat to this strategy, a threat to the united front of the Foundation. And so they make attempts to marginalize, to push-out people who don't dress, think and speak like them.

Bitcoin is bigger than you, me or anyone else here. Bitcoin is not a payments system, it is a transactional network with way more potential for how humans organize, govern and live. We haven't even begun to explore the true possibilities of this new technology of the blockchain.

Bitcoin is a shitty payments system. It is not meant for buying coffee at Starbucks. It is an economical tool to enable new forms of trade to thrive which extends further into the areas of resource management, decentralized law, and digital governance. We can use this to create the next generation of economic activity between humans, and organize on a local level much larger than ever before possible. We can find new ways to disempower banks, politicians, lawyers, police, judges and institutions.

Note the title of the Bitcoin 2013 conference which calls Bitcoin a """"payments innovation"""". This is their way of slanting Bitcoin so it's not a challenging new currency, but a safe addition to help banks streamline. A way to paper over the cracks in our current financial system.

These people are dangerous because of the influence they wield over Bitcoin that can destroy it as a free and open system. Recently Gavin made a post calling to raise the blocksize limit which is connected to this vision of Bitcoin as a system for payments. There is an agenda behind that kind of talk because raising the blocksize limit morphs Bitcoin as a better payment's system but centralizes more power with miners - which is already at dangerous levels in Bitcoin. We can either have a decentralized, free and uncensored Bitcoin, or a centralized Bitcoin good for payments (same as the banks).

Bitcoin is step by step getting deeper in our culture, and a culture needs art.

1044,"Quoting from the BBC article, just incase people didn't read the whole thing

&gt; Here's what happened.
&gt; 
&gt; On Monday evening, I suggested to Wright's PR firm that if he could send me a fraction of a coin from an early Bitcoin block - which of course I would return - that might show he had Satoshi's keys. But Wright's team came up with a different plan on Wednesday afternoon.
&gt; 
&gt; They sent me a draft blog in which he outlined a scheme that would see Matonis, Andresen and the BBC all send small amounts of Bitcoin to the address used in the first ever transaction. Then he would send it back, in what would be the first outgoing transactions from the block since January 2009.
&gt; 
&gt; We went ahead with our payments - I sent 0.017BTC (about £5), which you can still see in the online records. Matonis and Andresen sent similar amounts.
&gt; 
&gt; Then we waited. And waited. Then my phone rang - with the news that the whole operation was """"on hold"""", with no reason given.
&gt; 
&gt; Eighteen hours later we are still waiting for the payments to be made - and now Wright's new blog says that is not going to happen.

1045,"The Craig Wright news have been all over the world's TV stations, usually in a quick snippet format without entering into details beyond """"Bitcoin inventor found"""" or whatever. I have friends on several different countries, they all told me about this (""""normal"""" people far from anything geeky about Bitcoin/crypto). Literally everyone that isn't somewhat of an insider in the community (by insider I mean just simply following the news beyond the mainstream) thinks he is Satoshi.
Years from now, he will be studied as the creator of Bitcoin in schools.

Props to him for pulling this tho, this guy is a genius."

1047,"The whole point of this fucking system is eliminating trust from the equation. Trust no one, verify everything. It’s that easy.

1048,"A fee dependent block size limit to prevent spam and ensure that security is paid for:
 
What would you think about a new consensus rule that allowed miners to mine valid bigger blocks only if the total amount of fees collected in the blocks are greater than a certain threshold?

If a miner manages to construct a 1MB block where the total amount of fees collected is greater than X, then the new consensus rule would allow that miner to extend the size of this block up to 2MB.
If the total amount of fees in the 2MB block is greater than Y, then the miner is allowed to further extend the size of this block to 3MB, and so on...

The threshold defining X and Y can be made static for simplicity, or it could be made flexible according to some relevant parameters.

Any feedback is appreciated! Thank you!"
1049,"In the past several months, """"goatpig"""" has released a forked and updated version of """"etotheipi's"""" Armory. """"etotheipi's"""" Armory slowly screeched to a halt over the past several years (and was finally announced to be a defunct project earlier in the winter).

This new fork can be found here: https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory

So far, """"goatpig"""" appears to have made some notable positive changes, and I'm excited to see some renewed effort with this wallet:

1. Removed """"phone home code"""".
2. Added changelogs to the git repository.
3. Reduced database size to a manageable level and increased initial startup speed.
4. Removed torrent blockchain download mode.
5. DB corruption detection and auto repair
6. and more....


However, it seems like git commit tags are no longer signed? I am getting the following error when trying to verify:

    $ git tag -v v0.94.1 
    error: 811798a9282d216e0a450fe342d8a4671fee01d3: cannot verify a non-tag object of type commit.
    error: could not verify the tag 'v0.94.1'

I found a PGP public key for """"goatpig"""" at the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/master/PublicKeys/goatpig-signing-key.asc

It has a public key fingerprint of 

    745D 707F BA53 968B DF63 AA8D 8C52 1176 4922 589A

however it was created recently (2015.11.22), and has no signatures from others vouching for its authenticity. I have not seen any public, cryptographically signed indicators of """"etotheipi"""" giving any endorsement of """"goatpig"""" either. Can anyone vouch for the authenticity of this PGP public key?


There are releases published using github's release file storage feature: https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases

There is a sha256sums file included which does have a valid signature and the hash that is signed does match up with the .deb file that is included in that release. I'm not sure why the release package is signed but not the git repository's release tag.



If anyone has any knowledge on why git tags are not signed or what I may be doing wrong when trying to verify a signed git tag, that would be appreciated. Also, if anyone has any comments or experience with this new fork of Armory, I would appreciate to know what you have to say. As with any bitcoin software, public scrutiny is critical, regardless of how well intended the author, because everyone is human and can make mistakes. I don't think Armory has nearly the eyes or users that larger projects like """"Bitcoin Core"""" have. At the same time, """"Bitcoin Core"""" is lacking a lot of features that Armory does have, so there is definitely a reason to use another piece of software that extends the functionality of """"Bitcoin Core"""". Armory is potentially a great piece of software and now that the database size and initial start up have become much more efficient, it's possible it could be the wallet of choice again. However, more public review could really help to strengthen Armory's reputation and bring it more mainstream.

Although I am calling for more review and criticism of Armory, at the same time, I'd like to acknowledge and thank the key contributors to that piece of software """"etotheipi"""" and """"goatpig"""" for their hard work that they have donated to the world over many years."

1056,"**Tldr : If miners collectively commit to a transactional fee range that covers periods of network congestion and spare capacity, we may have a much more healthy network.  End users and companies providing Bitcoin services would have much better predictability about network behaviour.**

Advocates of big blocks and small blocks both have very good reasoning on their side.

Pieter Wuille (a clearly very clever guy that we have much to be thankful for) has I believe stated in the past that blocks should be full.  While this may be an anathema to those that believe the network should always have spare capacity, he has a very good point.  If transactions were free, or even very very cheap, why should a ledger that aims to persist for **EVER** have to hold these records, and why should miners have to validate and relay them.  We know that with the recent approaches to the capacity limits, the network has autonomously cleared up many of the issues around spam and non-commercial type transactions.

Conversely a network a that cannot scale, or even one that does not have a clear path to scalability, is not something that many companies and potential start-ups feel that can commit planning and resources to.  The fee market is a good thing but a fee market without any predictability becomes impractical.  Erik Voorhees pointed out that during one of the flood events the fee calculation that his wallet gave him was over $3!  This is before we get to any type of network overload associated with a price spike or a crash. 

Those that say larger blocks will risk centralisation, have to be realistic about the commercial imperatives for miners that have to keep an eye on the bottom line.   Segwit in combination with a 2mb hard fork get us to a capacity of approximately 1 million transactions per day.  If the average cost of a transaction was to rise to 20 cents due to capacity limits this gives miners $200,000 a day in fees, representing over 20% of their revenue after the halving, based on a $500 bitcoin price. 

In that event there would be great commercial pressure for them to increase their capacity, when so much of their profit margin rested on increased throughput.  They could risk 50 cent or even 1$ fees but at what point do users simply move to another chain?

If Lightning does come to pass sooner rather than later and it works as well as it might, we have a solution for our congestion problems.  However even in that eventuality, some users still need to know what on chain transactions are going to cost, be it $0.1 or $10.

Setting aside how the network might adapt for a moment, whether through an adaptive block size limit or softcoded block sizes.  Imagine if miners said they would endeavour to always keep fees below 20 cents at periods of high demand but also did not feel obliged to process transaction paying a fee less than 5 cents as a general rule.  This range could obviously be priced in any currency or sats/per byte if more appropriate.

Users, wallet providers, and companies would have predictability over what they should always include as a minimum fee.  Miners would have revenue projections based on anticipated demands and investors could make judgments about the viability of the network and its ability to scale. 

Miners are services providers just like ISP’s or municipal utilities.  They have capital and operational costs and risks that need to be accounted for.  But a network that is characteristically unpredictable, doesn’t work well for users or companies building tier 2 applications, and hurts everyone.

1067,"I have some concerns about the Blockchain born of ignorance; an issue which I seek to rectify here.

Based on my inadequate understanding of Bitcoin's blockchain, to control processing power is to control decision making. (Let's say I control 1% of the processing power). When my nodes solve a hash function, they get to verify transactions and earn bitcoins. Since hashes are solved by randomly guessing Public Keys and putting them in the hash function, I should solve 1% of all hashes (proportional to the % of the processing power I control.)
I can also use processing power to change the blockchain (public ledger). Since I only control 1% of the processing power, however, the rest of the network will always produce a longer blockchain and ignore my edited chain. I can't beat them because my processing power is too small.

However, what if I wanted to change a transaction before it was posted to the blockchain? Say, for instance, that I solved a hash, and then altered the transaction before placing it on the blockchain. I will be the first one to solve the hash 1% of the time, and will thus be the first one to add a new (edited) transaction to the blockchain 1% of the time. Thus, 1% of the time I will be providing the longest chain to the network, which will be accepted. I am successfully committing fraud 1% of the time.

The above paragraph is false. However, I don't understand how it is false. Could some helpful soul please enlighten me?"
1068,"(Well, I'm """"6 weeks behind,"""" but close enough; bare with me, please. I've always wanted to get into Bitcoin, but otherwise am *brand* new. I've read the material on the sidebar.) 

Now what? I plan to use *Armory* as my wallet manager, which I already have installed and configured—then I'll buy a Bitcoin or two off of a Bitcoin exchange (and probably tumble them). Then I should be good to go?

- Since I've downloaded the whole ledger, does this mean that bitcoin-qt will *always* be running in the background (validating transactions and so on) whenever I turn on my computer and log into this OS? 
- Does that take up a lot of RAM/CPU? 
- In fact, how exactly is my computer utilized?
- The blockchain seems to grow at about 4GB per month. That's pretty substantial (my Ubuntu partition's only about 400GB). If I run out of HDD space, do I then just become unable to, say, use Armory?
- Does anyone have a setup wherein the bitcoin database is stored on an external HDD? (I have a few extra laptop HDDs that I've collected over the years, and can easily spare a 300GB one to use specifically for bitcoin).

I really like the idea of Bitcoin, which is a large part of why I'm buying into it and trying to support the network. On the other hand, the more I read about it, the less certain I become of its long-term viability (especially in regards to the limited number of coins, thus each coin's subsequently increasing value, and an increasing concern of mining being centralized.) 

**Edit:** I'm downloading the entire blockchain because I'm under the impression that doing so assists the Bitcoin network as a whole (... somehow? I think my computer can now be used to validate transactions.) Am I incorrect?

**Edit 2:** ~~I've read a lot over the past few months and still don't really know what the blockchain is. I know that it's a ledger downloaded by every node, and these nodes use said ledger to verify transactions... but what does that mean? Say items on the ledger take the form of """"Payer X gives Y bitcoins to buyer Z,"""" great—but why does this situation translate to Bitcoin being secure, anonymous, or not-easily-toyed with?~~

~~So, my attempt at understanding this is as follows:~~

~~Every transaction on the ledger has a public key, and every wallet has an associated private key (X gives Y bitcoins to Z). Wallets have access to these keys (thus, they """"hold"""" bitcoins—or more accurately, hold transactions of bitcoins being given to them). When someone wants to spend bitcoins [from wallet **X**] by adding a transaction to the ledger, they first have to present their private key/s (indicating they have the appropriate transactions to spend), and then this new transaction is added to the ledger—and wallet **Z** gets its new private key that is associated w/ this transaction. Now, the key associated with the transactions that wallet **X** just used... become invalid, I guess?~~

~~Am I even on the right track? :l Why can't someone just artificially put a transaction on the ledger? I imagine it has something to do w/ mining—where each bitcoin is a solution to a particular mathematical problem? So if someone *can* figure out a solution to this problem, they would theoretically be able to put a transaction on the ledger, but such a thing just isn't viable, which is why we need huge computer processing power to come up w/ solutions?~~

1079,"I reviewed the [different proposals to solve the block size vs decentralization problem](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy) and I did not see mention of a time-and-amount-based trimming of the blockchain. **I humbly submit my proposal for prioritizing low-bitcoin-address removal at regular blockchain-trimming events.**

1. **Set a lifetime for bitcoin addresses** that is proportional to the *percentile* of addresses containing fewer bitcoin. For example, addresses with 99.9th percentile bitcoin amounts have a lifespan of 100 years. Addresses with 50th percentile bitcoin amounts have a lifespan of 10 years. Address with lowest percentile bitcoin amount would have a lifetime of 1 year. Lifetimes are assigned during a transaction or Collation event (see #2). If addresses with bitcoin still exist past their lifetimes, then all nodes automatically should make the bitcoin permanently inaccessible at the next Collation event (see #2).

2. **Collate all bitcoin transactions every 1 year**. This means nodes collectively create a single massive block that must contain all valid addresses and bitcoin amounts and may delete all addresses with expired lifetimes. Lifetimes are updated. All previous blocks may then be deleted from all nodes should the node owner choose to. Bitcoin in addresses not contained in this single massive block may not be spent ever again.

**These two rules will act together as an indirect block size limiter.** Unless people actively move expired bitcoin prior to a Collation event, the bitcoin is lost. This creates a minimum cost of preserving ownership of bitcoin. Not recycling bitcoin from deleted addresses is important in order to disincentivise militant actions against miners during the Collation block creation window. 

The main idea I want to communicate to you all is **pruning the blockchain to reduce the required data storage duty of nodes will help nodes remain active**. The timespans I stated don't matter as much as this idea. The rules I present are prioritization methods for determining what data in the blockchain may be safely preserved and what may be discarded. Following these rules should make larger block sizes more agreeable to those promoting a decentralized bitcoin.

Please correct me if I have made any statements that contradict how you understand Bitcoin works. Also, point me to any similar proposal.

Thank you for your time.

1096,"Hello, 

I may sound like an idiot right now, but I've had a difficult time purchasing Bitcoin. I need to buy $780.00 worth of Bitcoin through a debit card (or cash) but websites have stopped me from doing so.

1) I can't confirm identity on most websites because I have to be older than 18 years old to purchase Bitcoin, and I'm 17 years old currently.
2) There are so many maximum amounts of how much Bitcoin I can purchase. I'm looking to make this payment in one go. I'm limited to $40 a day payments, which I can't deal with.
3) Other small issues that are irrelevant.

I've been diving through websites to buy Bitcoin, but some solutions people have offered me were websites that have really high rates to take what I have, which I cannot afford  ($900&gt; per Bitcoin). Any ideas on what I can do? I haven't done this before. Thank you for your kindness."

**What does Project 100 Nodes aim to accomplish?**
Our goal is to add 100+ nodes to the network every month by selling low-cost nodes to those who apply.
These nodes will be hardware base. We are not selling a cloud service.

**How do you plan on making low-cost nodes?**
The nodes will run on a ARM Devices like the Raspberry Pi and Pine64.
Our 1st gen nodes will run in pruning mode off a 16GB USB3 flashdrive and a 16GB SD Card of Debian base Raspbian OS.
To make them low-cost we will be looking for donations and sponsorships.
Eg. Our first month we aim to sell 25 nodes. If we receive a total donation of $854 for our first donation drive that would lower the cost of each node by $34.16. A $75 node would now cost $40.84.

**How will I know what my donation is being spent on?**
100% of all donations will be used to lower the cost of the nodes we sell.
We will post full transparency reports of the hardware and shipping costs.
Eg. For the month of July 2016 our donation address would be 1Kp2G1W1RPVXHBAoiW8rTFsDvWEg1mJuLc. At the end of the month we total all donations in a USD amount and use that amount for the total donation received.

**Do you plan to add more node builders if demand for nodes are high?**
Yes! We plan on adding a few more in the near future.

**How will I know the software is secure?**
The only added software to the Raspbian OS will be our version of bitcoind. The source code will be added on github within the next few weeks.
All bitcoind updates will be signed from a offline computer and have their sha256 checksums posted on this site and our github.

**Why do I have to apply to purchase a node?**
To prevent people from misusing this project, we require people to apply.
Think about it like applying for a job."

The fact that your wallet addy is replaced and thrown away every single time is so much more confusing, I think just having one address works perfectly fine.

Does the bitcoin go to someone else, despite them typing in the addy correctly?
Very confused.

Then I remembered them during the 2013 bubble and withdrew them to my personal wallet, and promised to sell when it got """"just a little bit higher"""" I thought it would go forever. After the crash down to $200, I was kicking myself, but knew that I couldn't under any circumstances sell now.

Now that we're in a good run, I want to cash out, pay my taxes and retire while I still can. I've learned my lesson about greed and just want to cash out.

Even altcoins like nubits have DAO's that distribute funds for projects that will help their ecosystem.

1118,"The first time I heard about Bitcoin was on the SecurityNow! podcast, episode 287. I remember Steve Gibson's thoughts on it were cautiously optimistic. The math checked out, but as with all good cryptographic technologies, only time will tell. That was in 2011. Do I regret waiting this long? Maybe. I don't know why I didn't just set up my own mining rig since at the time it was still somewhat feasible for a poor university student to get a cheap box with a couple of out-of-date graphics cards to eat up electricity (which was included in my apartment's rent at the time). I probably could have gotten a couple of 50 BTC rewards, but it just didn't seem worth the effort at the time. How wrong I was. I've been following bitcoin with a lot of interest since, although I've never actually gotten around to getting any.

Anyhow, onto this morning. I decided it was silly of me to continue paying such attention to bitcoin without even ever owning any. I never had any particular reason for keeping bits on hand, but if I were to buy any bitcoin I had better do it before the price gets much higher. I've seen lots of posts complaining about how difficult it was, so I tried to be smart about it. Here's what I did:

• Download Mycelium on my phone. Nice little wallet app.

• Sign up on Circle.com

• Bought 130 CAD worth of BTC (mostly because that's all the free cash I had budgeted until next pay day).

• Sent a small test payment from my circle account to my mycelium wallet address.

I got it all set up in less time than it took me to type out this post! I just wanted to post this and let people know that it really isn't that hard to get into Bitcoin. The price is going crazy right now, so I definitely won't be putting my life savings into Bitcoin, but I think I'll probably treat it like an extra TFSA for a while, and just put some extra money into it from each paycheque. Just wanted to share!"

1127,"How does everyone see adoption in the face of the confusion surrounding the singular unit perception of the word 'bitcoin'? As value increases, at what point do we have to switch to using a smaller denomination name as the norm? Are we going to be stuck seeing prices starting at the 5th decimal place?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4m7pmf/bitgold_denied_my_first_withdrawal_and_froze_my/

&amp;nbsp;

Upon trying to withdraw my assets in Bitgold my transfer was refused and account blocked, when I rang them up to ask what was happening they refused to talk to me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I posted the thread here explaining the situation and sent the link to them, a few days later they responded asking for documents. Thanks to this publicity now they were giving me the opportunity to do this where as on the phone to support they were not interested in the least.

&amp;nbsp;

I am a business owner, I have ID, the name of the account I was attempting to withdraw to is in my name, I have business documents, I have tax documents. I sent what they requested and more in under 2 hours of receiving the request.

&amp;nbsp;

I did not complain about my treatment anymore because I want it resolved and did not update the original thread so they could see I had no intention to further damage their reputation if they resolved the issue:-

&amp;nbsp;

""""Hi (xxx),

Thank you for your email.

Please see all the requested documents attached, they are as high quality
as possible and I have also attached additional documents in the form of my
National ID. I am not employed but a business owner and so have provided a
copy of certificates of incorporation as a substitute.

I have also provided multiple months of my bank statement and if you
require it I can provide a print screen of the online account also.

Best Regards,

&amp;nbsp;


""""Hello (xxx),

Thank you for providing these documents. They have been sent to our Compliance team for review. I will let you know if any further clarification is need.

We appreciate your patience while we complete the verification process!

Kind regards,

This was on June 3rd, 13 days ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

To clarify, I deposited money with this company, can prove its mine, where its come from, can prove its going to my account and gave them the documents for this and they have still not given me my money back.

&amp;nbsp;

Not only that but I sent a polite email asking for an update a few days later and it was IGNORED. I sent another email 2 days ago and that too has been ignored.

&amp;nbsp;

Either this company is now confirmed to be in the business of scamming its customers where it pleases or their overall level of service is abysmal. Either way do NOT touch this company with a barge-pole.

Smart contracts should run as side-chains so that the potential controversy won't spread to the main chain and won't affect the reserve of value status for non participants in the contract.

Ideally we can imagine those side-chains as independent legal systems, and one can choose which legal system to use when creating a contract. However the contract will reference a specific unit of value that is not directly connected with the legal system being used so that in case of issues the controversy is about the legal system and not the unit of value"

I took a look into my bitcoin address and I still had like 2 BTC which I forgot about. So I tryed to login into my blockchain wallet (I still have most information written down) but it wants me to do an authentification, for that they send me an email.
The problem is I don't have access to that email account (restoring is not an option as the E-Mail provider bascially shut down their service).
So I found out I could use this https://blockchain.info/wallet/reset-two-factor form to have them put a new email address into my account. The thing is I have read that blockchain isn't really doing any support and not working through those forms. So I wanted to ask is there anyother way for me to get access to my blockchain wallet? I still have my wallet identifier, password and the passphrase (if it is the 17 words long thing)

**TL;DR**: Lost acces to my email account but blockchain wants me to authenticate myself using said email. Which reliable ways are there for me to restore access, using this form (https://blockchain.info/wallet/reset-two-factor) isn't really reliable as I heard. I have the passphrase."

1140,"Let me start this off by saying I don't know much about bitcoin. 

Anyways, my nephew was telling me about bitcoin and how he thinks it's going to be really huge thing. It was fresh on my mind when I was browsing through a trading group on Facebook. I ended up finding a guy who was looking for some computer parts so I messaged him. 

We came up with a deal of around $100 for a box of parts from around 2013. He came to my place later to pick it all up and the conversation got to bitcoin. He said he was a miner back when they were easy to get and I started to get more interested. I ended up setting up another deal with him for $35 worth of bitcoin and he told me to download Bitcoin Wallet from the play store so he could send me the bitcoin. He helped me out a lot and I made sure not to share information about my account other than my btc address. Now I have $35 worth of bitcoin sitting in my wallet. 

I know I could just spend them, but is there a way to make more off them? I'm not trying to get rich over night or anything but I'm interested to know what I can do with them other than spending them. 

Sorry for my ignorance on the subject, I didn't think I'd be getting bitcoins any time soon. I understand noob questions can be pretty annoying at times, I really don't mean to be 'that guy' but I couldn't find out much on Google other than shady looking gambling sites and would honestly prefer answers from people who have been in the bitcoin game for a while."

1148,"In the philippines 10 cents is 4.6 pesos, the average low end salary is 1500 pesos per week. That means just 20 transactions per week is 6-7% of your weekly salary.

Fees are too high to sustain adoption of 5 billion underbanked working poor around the world.

So we know this:

1) it is beneficial to create solutions to increase space in a block (segwit/thin blocks/ LN etc)

2) it is beneficial to have a block size limit (and transaction fees) to prevent sustained large scale ddos style attacks on the network.

3) it is beneficial for global adoption for those fees to be as small as possible to promote inclusion for all people around the world. Also I doubt the average person would pay 10 cents to move money from his bed side table to his pocket (akin to moving money from cold storage to hot wallet)

Why is this not a viable solution:

Create segwit / thin blocks / LN etc to help more transactions fit in 1 block. 

At the same time implement a solutuion that says the blocksize limit is always 20% higher than the average block size over the last 5000 blocks (roughly 1 month), this will prevent sustained ddos style attacks and allow low fees on the network.

These two solutions combined will work together to keep the blocksize as low as possible (seg wit and other solutions will reduce the average blocksize over time) while allowing low fees on the network and also preventing large scale ddos style attacks on the network.

Why is this not viable??

Edit: as a note it is my belief that the price of bitcoin will always be high enough to incentivise miners with the block reward, even if that reward is less than 1 btc every 10 minutes. If you dont believe this then you also dont believe in the long term success of bitcoin.

Logic: The reduction in supply (halving) actually causes the price to rise which maintains the incentive and therefore level of security.. the price is driven by supply and demand. Supply reduction inturn increases the price which maintains a level of reward value that maintains the same level of security as before the halving, if not more! Did the hashrate fall after the last halving? No it is now orders of magnitude higher than it was before the last halving. Even with a wall on asic development a halving would not reduce the hash rate long term (the price has already doubled just in anticipation of the halving).

Also in 140 years when the miners will be relying on fees the number of transactions due to a global population of users will be more than enough to incentivise miners (and as the population increases so does the number of users and transactions and therefore the amount of fees)."

1169,"Random thought: so since the genesis block was mined January 3, 2009, the first bitcoin halving was November 23, 2012, and the second halving is projected for July 9, 2016, it seems these dates are a bit more than four years apart. Considering the fact that the first and second halving are projected to be ~3.61 years apart, can we be certain that the following halving will be in 2020? Of course it depends on the change in the hashrates of the network, but it could possibly be early 2020 or possibly late 2019. For certain it seems that it will be prior to July 2020.

Here is my new """"feel good"""" advertising plan.  One that showcases the bitcoin concept and community of \/r/bitcoin in a positive light.

We create a """"Year of Bitcoin Donations"""" from \/r/bitcoin.  12 charities get selected for donations.  Each month we ~~brigade~~ politely ask reddit for (bitcoin) donations.  The fund will match bitcoin-based donations up to 1BTC per charity.

Notes:  

1.  Charities selected by top comment upvotes?  I don't know.  Hopefully people wouldn't abuse that situation.  Maybe a two-round selection.  1st round (with comments) selects 60 charities, 2nd round (no commenting) selects the final 12.  Voting should be held in \/r/bitcoin.

2.  Bitcoin technical assistance should be offered to the charities.  Maybe a bitpay or coinbase could step in and handle this aspect.

3.  One downside to all of this is that the end of the year all the bitcoin for """"matching""""  donations are gone.  Maybe an internal donation drive can be held on \/r/bitcoin.

4.  Perhaps the charities could be linked to causes or situations that bitcoin could ameliorate or improve on a larger scale?

5.  Maybe reserve the 12th month for a humanitarian crisis that has arisen that year.

**original post**

Backstory:  I lived in Thailand and had plans to go to a conference in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Today I used my bank card to purchase one of the few things in life that I can’t with BTC, a visa for Vietnam. However, when going through processing I was asked three verification questions:

- Who did you buy the house at xxx address from?

Not sure of the exact wording used, but it was basically how did you come to own/how did you buy/etc.. Unfortunately for me I’ve never seen that address in my life, i have no idea where it comes from as I’ve only ever lived at two residences in America, both of which I know the address to. There was option for this is not applicable to me which i chose.

- What age range is closest for Mom Tackett

My mom’s last name isn’t tackett though, so I don’t know why they’re using that name. She and my dad have been divorced since before I can remember, so they’re using information that’s out of date since at least 1995. The age ranges they gave me didn’t actually have one with her age, it was something like 25-35, 40-45, 46-55, 60+, my mom is 56. There was no correct answer. I chose the closest and went from there.

- What city does Brother Tackett live in?

My brother moved several months ago, so again, there was no correct answer. But it did have his previous city, so I answered with that.

After all of that they deemed that it was a fraudulent transaction and wouldn’t process it. Luckily for me, the fraud department at my bank was online and was able to remove the block and for me to book my visa. So you may say, “see! the system works.""""  However, when I had this exact same problem in 2013 while in Thailand trying to buy a flight i lost out on hundreds of dollars because I had to go to an agent and pay with cash.

I had a conversation with some people in a bitcoin wechat group im in about how much I hate banks after taking my ICBC (largest bank in the world) card to an ICBC branch in malaysia to withdraw all my money since I can’t use the card in Thailand (even at an ICBC branch). Unfortunately in Malaysia I also can’t use that card, even at an ICBC. People were saying i’m doing myself a disservice by not having a bank, but in the past 8 days i’ve been denied my money from my bank three times, once in Thailand trying to use an ICBC, once in Malaysia trying to use an ICBC, and now by Visa. I’ve never once been prompted to go through verification with bitcoin, i’ve never once been denied the ability to send money, and for the people saying the verification/restrictions are for my safety, i’ve never had as much as a satoshi stolen from me, but i have had to spend hundreds of dollars to fix the mess caused by my banks.

This is why i’ve had my salary paid 100% in bitcoin for over 2 years, this is why I hold the vast majority of my money in bitcoin, and this is why I know that bitcoin has a future. To anybody who says that the current banking system works just fine, that’s ludicrous, start traveling and nearly every day you’ll see why bitcoin is needed; fees to convert currency, 5-50%—yes, it was literally 50% to convert Vietnamese dong to Thai baht at the Phuket airport; fees to withdraw from an ATM ($6, 2%); and tons of places charge you extra 3-5% plus flat fee if you use a cc.

**Other stories about why I hate banks**


Story time:
In 2014 I was at Bitcoin2014 in Amsterdam, had an amazing trip that forever changed my life. While there I discovered that if you don’t have chip &amp; pin a lot of places won’t accept your debit card, and even worse that they don’t even accept cash. My bank didn’t offer chip &amp; pin cards when mine was issued so unfortunately couldn’t use my card nor my cash. When i went back to the states in July I asked specifically for a chip and pin card but they said they still don’t offer them and that I’d have to deal with swipe and sign for the time being. So I got my card and headed off on my travels once more, this time to kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan. When I get there I receive an email from my bank that they’ll promptly be canceling my card as they’re switching everyone over to chip and pin. I could ask for a two-week extension, but that’s it, after that I’ll have to wait for my new card to arrive. They also won’t send cards abroad, so i have to have it sent to my family and then have them ship it to asia (one card has already been lost in this process). So once again, I have no way to access my money.

Second Story time:
When bitcoin hit $1000 in 2013 some friends and I took a trip to the Philippines. I sold a bitcoin and had the fiat transferred to my bank account (Wells Fargo). I went to use my card at an ATM and it was denied, I called my bank and tried to get the situation fixed. After going through social security number, recent withdrawal locations/amounts, and account information they said """"no problem, we’ll have it all fixed here shortly, just need you to tell me how much your monthly mortgage payments are.” I was 21 and living in Beijing, i didn’t have any mortgage payments. So he let me know that wasn’t a problem, just needed to know how much my monthly car payment was. I was 21 and living in Beijing, I didn't have a monthly car payment. I was then promptly told “bummer, nothing we can do” and had to spend well over an hour going from supervisor to supervisor before I finally got the block lifted. It’s important to note that I notified them of my travel plans well in advance of my trip.
*** 

This is why I love bitcoin, my money is actually my money and i can use it 24/7/365. Even if I need to wait 30 minutes for a confirmation, it is vastly superior to not being to use your money at all.

**Tldr;** Visa has deemed my transactions fraudulent several times because i was unable to answer security questions that don't have correct answers. Bitcoin has never told me I can't spend my money. "
1194,"So I've been using Bitcoin pretty regularly and mostly as a checking account.  I do have a chunk of savings but as I understand it I only pay taxes when I """"realize"""" a profit and it has sat untouched for a few years with some adding here and there.  

My spending account is where I'm unsure what to do.  I have an auto-buy with Coinbase and I spend it using a debit card.  I've never really had more than $150-200 in there for any length of time and then I spend it on bills, lunches, and so on.  I'm sure with the price growth this year I've made some minor profit on occasion but my spending of it has been on literally thousands of separate occasions.  Am I really supposed to be reporting and paying capital gains tax on something I use like cash?  That's just seems insane to do all that calculations for what would likely be a very small amount owed in taxes.  That being said I have no illusions that Coinbase isn't doing that very thing and sending it to the IRS.  So I'd rather not pay thousands in fines for """"lying"""" either.

Maybe if Coinbase was transparent and actually let me see the information they were sending to the IRS I could just base it off their caluclations.  Would make my life a whole lot easier and I wouldn't have to worry so much.  Any ideas?"
1195,"I make it a point to try every bitcoin service I can get my hands on.  I have I think 12 wallets on my iphone.  I have more online accounts than I can even keep up with.  I've even found myself going back to old services forgetting I had signed up to find out """"this email/username is already registered.""""

So my current project was to have every available Bitcoin debit card I could in order to try them all.  The only one I have operational currently is from Coinbase.  

After some searching it appeared my options were Bitpay, Coinbase, Xapo, and Cryptopay.me... or so I thought.

In the last hour I have discovered that if I have a US billing address, Cryptopay cannot grant me a debit card.  Turkey? No problem.  China? Communism isn't that bad.  Out of something like 100 countries, US is unavailable.  Bitpay, after trying to sign up for the card and giving my information I had to """"email compliance@bitpay.com for further information"""" but I could not continue the debit card process.  And as soon as I put my country and state into Xapo.com (which I've had an account with for *months*) I was given the message that my account was immediately terminated, all access is cut off, and I must send them an email with a bitcoin address if I wanted any remaining balance held with their service (luckily I didn't).

None of them will touch me with a 1,000 mile fiber cable the second I put in my address.  I rarely get over worked and try to keep a calm head about things... but fuck the United States and their mountain of horseshit financial regulation that clearly fails *spectacularly* when it comes to their ~~mission~~ *excuse* of """"protecting the consumer.""""  

As much as many people, myself included, get angry with Coinbase and their invasions of privacy, I have come to realize they are the only company with the balls to even *try* to offer the service in my area.  One that may, at any moment, reward them with a cease &amp; desist order or indictment from (enter generic authoritarian incumbent-supporting government acronym here).  The fact they they cover their ass by seemingly going beyond what the regulations state is likely out of fear, not malice.  

So in closing... Thank you Coinbase.  I know you are just trying to help and the bitcoin debit card has been a very simple and easy to use service that I now appreciate much more than I did about an hour ago.  

What a fucking joke.

1196,"I saw this title via Twitter from CB Insights.  So, I clicked it and shortly thereafter, I received, via email, a 32 slide PDF presentation with the same title.  Is really interesting how much money is going into blockchain development, particularly by the banks.

I've heard people say that """"Blockchain"""" and """"Bitcoin"""" are the same thing.  I'm not so sure.  I see JP Morgan, for instance, investing in blockchain technology.  Their need, alone, for a proprietary blockchain could dwarf the entire market cap of bitcoin.  Global payments are $1.7 trillion.  If they develop their own blockchain, is that good or bad for the value of bitcoin?  Or ETH?

1197,China miners cry when proposing bigger blocks but they already have a huge advantage due to cheap electricity costs. We don't cry about that so why do we have to cater to miners that already have a huge advantage?
1198,I am noticing that Coinbase is up about 7 dollars per BTC compared to other exchanges. Is this normal in the markets or is Coinbase now raising their price since they are the biggest?
1199,"I was excited to use Bitcoin for my first time at a physical store, only to be embarrassed and in the end I paid for my dinner 4 times. (i've used bitcoin online with no problems many times).

Here is what happened:

1) A food truck advertises they accept Bitcoin
2) I said i'd like to pay with Bitcoin
3) He pulls out his iphone and mentions he hasn't had someone pay with Bitcoin for a while.
4) He tries to find his bitcoin wallet app - I have no idea which wallet he used as I didn't really recognize the symbol (it took him a bit of fumbling before he found it)
5) A bit more fumbling to setup the payment request
6) he figured it out and typed in the price to request: $9
7) The QR code was generated
8) I pressed the QR code symbol on my coinbase wallet and it momentarily froze/glitched my phone but 2nd time worked. I paid with my coinbase wallet by scanning the QR code - it did some weird vibration thing on my phone with absolutely no confirmation that I sent a payment - nothing happened on my wallet or his wallet visually. In the spur of the moment and with a line up behind me I scanned it again..still nothing. He said to try again, so I did and again nothing.
9) He gave me the slip that says I paid and said to get my food cause he has to help the other people behind me now
10) I press return/back on my coinbase wallet while waiting at the side and see that there are 3 pending send payments to him of $9 on my phone and says pending even 1 hr after. For some reason each transation had a decline button but when pressing it a message pops up saying it failed due to not being a request.
11) I get my food but I am now akwardly waiting at the side staring at my phone and the three pending send transactions. After he helped everyone in the line I went up to him and he said he still got nothing and went to look into the transaction history and shows the last transaction someone made with him was June 12th. During this conversation he says he's no bitcoin expert and that he lost money by accepting bitcoin because he never cashed them when they were worth """"double"""" in 2013.
11)  ended up paying with my mastercard :/
12) I logged into my coinbase account on my laptop maybe 2 hours later and see all payments have been sent to him with 8 confirmations (no longer pending)

This experience ticked me off and when I got the food I had to tell my mom, brother and his fiance that it didn't work and that I may have paid him 4 different times (now confirmed after looking at my coinbase accnt)


EDIT:
Thanks everyone!, yeah i can't f igure out if it was coinbase or his wallet that caused the problem (or maybe both?). I never had problem with coinbase hot wallet for spending online before. (maybe that was because they were using coinbase as the processor online). I'll try my mycelium wallet next time. I guess we can say my first experiment went bad ;) But hoping the next one will be better after learning some things myself from this experience (like NEVER scan a QR code more than once even if you dont think it worked and ill try myecelium next time).

P.S: This post isn't meant to hound bitcoin - I love bitcoin with a passion. Just wanted to post my first experience using bitcoin at a physical store and how I felt about it. I def learned a few things on my side."

1201,"Up until this point I've never used bitcoin, though I'm looking to replace my total dependence on the banking system, as well as give me a new medium to explore as a budding programmer. I know there is at least one service that allows me to get my pay directly sent to a bitcoin account, and at least two or three services that allow transferring those coins to debit cards. I'm really not looking to hoard it so much as use it as a day to day currency. Here is my questions as someone who is somewhat familiar with the technology/community but has no firsthand experience:

How trustworthy are these types of services? Are there services that really outshine the competition?

What are some potential issues  with using it as a day to day currencies? 

Are third party based services/web based wallets secure? 

What are some of the security measures recommended for keeping my wallets from being hacked/targeted?

1203,"**Introduction**

Gold standard is a favorable system, but it is unexpectedly eliminated by the government. Gold boasts unparalleled advantages. However, that cannot prevent the government from killing the gold standard. Below is a close look at how the gold standard is wiped out by the government step by step and how bitcoin should avoid repeating the tragedy. 
 
**Chapter 1 Gold as a natural currency**
 
Gold has been the most time-honored and widely-used currency in the human history. Its advantages cannot be ignored. 

There are 118 elements on the periodic table of elements. Gold, the No. 79 element, is adopted by humans as a symbol of honor and wealth. On the periodic table elements, there are elements in the gaseous state or the liquid state; elements whose form is unstable or which can go into combustion easily; elements who can do harm to human body; elements which are rare, hard to smelter and difficult to find by ancients. Excluding all the above elements, gold and silver are the only two elements left. In terms of stability, gold has an edge over silver because silver can be easily oxidized or vulcanized into a black color. Therefore, gold becomes the natural currency.

Featured by a stable chemical property, it means gold can act as an enduring transaction medium. To serve as currency, gold should be able to be split and cut for the convenience of carrying. Alas! Gold has all these characteristics. With a favorable physical ductility, gold can be molded into various shapes. Last but not least, gold is a rare existence in the natural world. It was generated by the explosion of new stars when fixed stars died. Up to date, humans have not yet developed the ability to make the element of gold. The only way for humans to obtain gold is to exploit gold mines on the earth. 

All these characteristics have made gold the most successful currency in the world. Gold can be traced back to 5,000 years ago. Gold was once the most popular currency, leading to the emergence of the gold standard system. Despite of the many undoubtable advantages, the gold standard was still eliminated by humans in modern times. To put it more directly, gold was marginalized in terms of its currency position. **Despite of the many undoubtable advantages, the gold standard was still eliminated by humans in modern times. To put it more directly, gold was marginalized in terms of its currency position.** 


 
**Chapter 2 Elimination process of the gold standard by the fiat money**

 **In the human history, the gold standard system has three realization forms, namely the gold coin standard system, the gold bullion standard system and the gold exchange standard system. The three realization forms constitute the substantial process in which the gold standard system was encroached step by step.** The symbolic case of marginalization of gold as a currency was the collapse of the Bretton Woods Systems. Since then, humans have entered the era of the fiat money standard system.

    The gold coin standard system refers to adopting gold coins as fiat standard coins. In other words, according to the gold coin system, gold is directly used as money, and currency manufacturing is not monopolized by the country. As long as one has the ability, he can exploit gold mines, smelter and make gold into gold coins. The gold coin standard system ruled for more than one century. 

**The gold bulletin standard system refers to replacing gold coins with bank notes. According to the gold bulletin standard system, bank notes can be equally exchanged into gold**. In China, bank notes were mainly issued by old-style Chinese private banks, which promised to settle their issued currency according to the fixed exchange rate of gold and silver. The exchange had no limits and was free. To some extent, this could guarantee that bank notes were corresponding to authentic gold. If one made false promises, one would suffer risks of being squeezed. However, this still impaired the nature of gold as a rare existence because of a non-100% reserve fund system, enabling the total number of bank notes to overtake that of gold. Under the currency system, currency issuance institutions with the right to issue currency emerged. The issuance of currency was realized through the issuance of bank notes. This suggested that currency issuance started turning into a right. 

The gold exchange standard system is a virtual gold standard system. The country required gold to be put in one place, such as the central bank, and then the country issued its domestic currency and promised to implement the fixed exchange rate of gold. If the government wanted to issue currency, it needed to purchase the equal amount of gold. To avoid abuse of the currency policy, the government pledged on national credit. This further destroyed the gold standard system. Currency issuance was monopolized by the government. The exchange rate based on the government guarantee was never realized in history.

The Bretton Woods System symbolized the peak of the gold exchange standard system. The US government in a dominating role promised to connect the USD with gold, clarifying that the price of one ounce of gold was equal to 35 USD. Later, governments all over the world issued their domestic currencies and connected them with the USD to guarantee a fixed exchange rate. If the US government wanted to issue the USD, it needed to get the same amount of gold. If other governments wanted to issue their domestic currencies, they needed to get the same amount of gold. The system greatly weakened the gold standard system. In this way, there were two anchors with the currency issuance right in principle, but in practice there were no anchors at all, because none had the right to check how much gold the Federal Reserve had. Governments all over the world did not have an institution to supervise the issuance amount of their currency. 

Quite soon, the Bretton Woods System collapsed, and the US president announced stopping exchange between the USD and gold in 1971. The gold standard system was eliminated. Since then, governments all over the world have adopted the credit money standard system. The credit money standard system has existed for nearly half a month. Despite that, gold is still regarded a kind of currency, universally acknowledged in the international community. However, its position as a currency has been weakened, just having the value storage function. 

**The process for the credit money system to replace the gold standard system was to first turn gold from a currency in circulation into a currency of settlement. Later, its settlement function was also deprived of, which turned gold into a value storage currency.** 

**Chapter 3 Risks of bitcoin to undergo marginalization of gold**

Bitcoin simulates physical properties of gold in terms of design. It is also rare, endurable, separable and portable. After more than seven years of market selection, bitcoin has grown into an indispensable Internet currency. It has also found its applications in the offline economic life. 

At present, development of bitcoin has encountered its bottleneck. The bitcoin block is too small to make room for more transactions. The bitcoin community is also hotly discussing about techniques to expand the transaction capacity of bitcoin.
 
Now, there are mainly two proposals for expansion of bitcoin. First, maintain the payment function of bitcoin, and directly refer to the onchain sacling with hard fork. Second, persist in turning bitcoin into a settlement network, build the second layer of network based on bitcoin and use the technique of side chain and lightning network to enhance the payment function of bitcoin. 

There is nothing new in the world. Though bitcoin is still a leading technique, it is a representation of historical events. After the gold coin standard system was stably implemented for one hundred years, the gold coin standard system was altered by a group of wise bankers and private bank owners into the gold bulletin standard system. After two world wars, the gold bulletin standard system was turned by those led by the US government into the gold exchange standard system. After two world economic crises, the US government took little effort to completely eliminate the gold standard system, thus building the modern credit currency system. 

**Bitcoin has not yet developed for eight years, but it has been faced with the selection of “bitcoin standard system,” “bitcoin block system” or “bitcoin exchange system.”**

Direct use of bitcoin is similar to the “gold coin standard system.” Here, the author gives it a new name, “bitcoin standard system.” In the lightning network, the main chain of bitcoin is expanded to the second layer of protocol, and the main chain just undertakes the settlement function, which is similar to “gold bulletin standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin block standard system.” Use of the side chain to build a brand-new payment platform is similar to “bitcoin exchange standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin exchange standard system.”

    When people used bank notes to replace gold coins as the currency in circulation, ease of use of bank notes was greatly highlighted compared with a pile of gold coins, and to print bank notes took less cost compared with mining, smelting and casting of gold coins. People were ready to use bank notes. However, there were no free banquets in the world. While enjoying the convenience brought by bank notes, people had to face the concentration of rights in banks. They obtained the right to issue currency and had some reserve fund. Apparently, the gold standard system was the only one to suffer from this. **In fact, people were deprived of their right to safeguard their private property.**
 
People take delight in using the lightning network and side chain to design a set of more convenient and cheaper payment network. They get not only convenient, but also cost reduction. People have to believe more block chain operators, the hub of the lightning network and the side chain platform. Maybe, we can confidently think that, with nodes, there will not be some reserve fund or cheats of the side chain platform and hub. However, more than a hundred years ago, developers of bank notes also promised so. Once users have to pay an expensive price to check their own accounts (the main chain settlement system must be expensive), users have lost their ability to verify their accounts. **In this way, the ability of bitcoin to protect inviolability of the private property will be challenged.**
 
If the bitcoin network turns from a payment network into a settlement network, it means the death of the “bitcoin standard system,” and the bitcoin will lose one of its three functions, namely payment, value storage and settlement, just like what had happened to gold several hundreds of years ago. With the increasing number of banks, more and more bank notes were printed, but the reserve fund rate was decreasing. Gold had to say goodbye to its settlement function. When bitcoin’s main chain is connected with various lightning networks and side chains, will the settlement function of bitcoin also be deprived of? Logically speaking, if the main chain settlement cost is too high, the market must find a cheaper way, such as connecting side chains with sub-side chains, or bridging two different lightning networks to achieve direct cross-chain settlement without the trouble of closing channel on the main chain. The last question is when bitcoin will be deprived of its value storage function. 

 
**Chapter 4 Failure of gold to protect the gold standard system and failure of the small block of bitcoin to protect the “bitcoin block system”**

Gold boasts lots of natural advantages. It is a decentralized currency in real sense, but the gold standard system was still eliminated. Natural advantages and physical properties of gold could not protect the gold standard system, but humans could. 

When Keynes challenged against the gold standard system, governments all over the world followed him. None wanted to stand out to protect the gold standard system or the protection force was too small. People were happy to see the increasing number of their paper coins and experience the convenience of paper coins, but were blind to the cost they paid for these. 

Bitcoins are decentralized and can ignore enemies like governments. However, the truth was gold could not protect the “gold standard system” with its physical properties. The decentralization property of bitcoin will not be so powerful to outweigh physical properties of gold. **Whether decentralization of bitcoin could protect itself relies on humans or talents which can maintain its decentralization instead of a religion-like small block.** The small block refuses more users to join the “bitcoin standard system.”
In the human history, the “gold bulletin standard system” and the “gold exchange standard system” which offered more convenient but were also more complex were created by allowing fewer and fewer people to join the “gold coin standard system.” At last, governments used the credit money system to totally eliminate the “gold standard system.”

**During the development process of bitcoin, will bitcoin repeat the tragedy of gold? The author thinks this will not happen, because people can avoid it by expanding its bigger block.** 

One after another world economic crisis reminded people of the gold standard system. Satoshi Nakamoto published “On brink of second bailout for banks” on The Times on January 3, 2009. Did it warn bitcoin fans that the “bitcoin standard system” was going to be eliminated? 


**Chapter 5 Not to refuse new techniques but not to let new techniques eliminate the “bitcoin standard system”**

 Here, the author does not refuse the lightning network and the side chain. These techniques are great. However, if they are accepted at the cost of refusing bigger blocks, people will lose the “bitcoin standard system.” That is the least expected.

    Here, the author supports establishing various high techniques on bigger blocks. While enjoying high techniques, people can also use the backward “bitcoin standard system” to protect the foundation of their private property right. 


**Chapter 6 Conclusion** 

One after another world economic crisis has aroused people’s nostalgia of the gold standard. As it is stated above, Satoshi Nakamoto had warned bitcoin fans of the potential risk of losing the “bitcoin standard system.”

1217,"I'm traveling to the USA for a holiday in a couple of months time (traveling from NZ). 

Over the past 18 months I've been regularly putting money into Bitcoin, and have made some reasonable profit off of the growth in its value. 

I want to spend some of this money while I'm in America. Ideally, I'd like to find some kind of card-based solution that allows me to load up some of my bitcoins and then transact them like  a regular bank card (e.g. roll up to an ATM and withdraw some cash, buy clothes in a shopping mall, whatever).

I could sell the Bitcoin and get the money back in to my bank account here in NZ. However, that opens me up to paying tax on the profit I've made due to capital gain. 

But if I can put some of my Bitcoin onto a pre-loaded card and then use that while I'm in America, I don't face any taxation requirements back home.

1228,"So the contest OP is now collecting Bitcoin addresses and corresponding Reddit usernames.  

He can cross-reference the usernames against large website password leaks, and run a script attempting the corresponding leaked password for that username at the major Bitcoin wallet sites / exchanges.  

Anyone dumb enough to use the same username/password across multiple sites just lost their coins.  It may not yield many hits, but it will most likely yield some.  

For the record, I did post a wallet address for myself on the thread, but use long random passwords unique to each site, different usernames, so think I'm safe.  But please let me know if I'm an idiot!

1229,"1. bitGo must pay something substantial towards the loss after all they signed for it.
2. Convert Lost BTC into bfx equity and let users own 50% equity via a bfx coin or other equity instrument.
3. Change security and be completely open and transparent.

1230,"So last Friday I realized I needed to renew a subscription to a streaming site for football, last year I paid with paypal, this year their only accepting Bitcoin. The cost is $25 USD in bitcoin. So I searched and found Coinbase as the most recommended. I set up the account and added a bank account. I initiated a transfer for $25 worth of bitcoin, they said it would take 3-5 days to transfer, spoiler alert it took 5 days. During this time the price for bitcoin went up and down and now the service is $28 worth of bitcoin at its current price. My bitcoin transferred and now its worth $22 so I need to $3. Except Coinbase wont accept my debit card (its a payroll card that is attached to the same bank account I transferred the original amount from). Ive emailed them but havent heard back from them. I need to pay for the service by sunday but cant wait another 3-5 days for it to transfer. Ive looked everywhere to try and find somewhere that I can buy the $3 of bitcoin with my debit card but cant find anywhere. Im kinda mad that while my purchase was in limbo that it didnt adjust to the new rate. Does anywhere know what I can buy .00634195BTC ($3.70) instantly with a debit card?"
1231,"We are going to get a press release here shortly from BitFinex but I wanted to give a perspective on what has and has likely happened over the past several days.

1) Let's get this fact absolutely clear the coins that were hacked from the segregated BitGo wallets were coins of BFX **customers** not of the company itself -- so as we come to determine what percentage btc holders (and possibly active USD lenders) are getting haircut remember this includes no offering from the company to offset those losses nor have they taken a direct financial loss as a result of the hack(although a ton of secondary loss in their brand, trust and credibility). 

2) Over the course of the last several days I am 100% aware that Giancarlo (CFO) has been making his rounds to a number of influencers, market makers and big players -- I suspect Phil Potter (CSO) and others are doing the same and they are making swearheart deals or otherwise try and regain their trust in making these players whole again. I believe this will come at the cost of a greater burden of haircuts put on the plebs that are all but defenseless at this point.

3) They are smart enough however to understand they can't totally fuck the plebs -- after all they are still going to need order flow from active retail traders to entice the MMs to feed off of so I highly anticipate they will offer some token gestures to the plebs -- the simplest would be to offer something free trading for 6 months but I have heard enough rumors (coming from Giancarlo) of a bfxcoin to think it could be played in angle to appease the plebs, keep them involved with BFX and tie them to its sustained success 

The most important aspect to this release is what, if anything is BFX as a company pleading financially to those that are getting haircuts ? We don't even know formally how much BFX as a company itself has in assets but they 100% responsible in failing to follow industry best practices. However with that said the damage to brand/trust/image has been done and it actually in the best interest of BFX to not offer any direct monetary compensation or offset those losses from their own funds as it does little to improve their image beyond a token level effort. The damage is done so they need to focus on what they can do with the assets and cash they have rather than turn a 63% haircut into a 40% haircut.

We will know soon enough

1233,"Hello, 

I would like to ask this community to listen to my situation and offer your personal opinions/suggestions. They are greatly appreciated, so thank you in advance for offering your time and sharing your knowledge.

So, I first became a buyer, &amp; since holder of bitcoin in October 2015 (I've yet to spend bitcoin on services or products). For the past 10 months I've slowly been accumulating bitcoins in $20 increments weekly, while making larger purchases when I can afford too. I currently hold about 5 bitcoins.  

I'm in my early 20's and work in the financial industry. I strongly believe in bitcoin's ability to initiate the transition and propel the global acceptance of the age of digital currency. To get to the point, I want to know what you think about setting up an account in order to receive a percentage of my salary in bitcoin. I still need cash to pay my expenses (at the moment) but would like to accumulate bitcoin more consistently and conveniently. I can afford to make this decision. I've spent a long time running through the outcomes of going down this path. I'm financially comfortable in receiving 5-10% of my salary in BTC. 

What would you do if you were in my kind of situation given your knowledge and experience? What else am I not taking into consideration, that I should be thinking about?

1234,"Millions are stolen from the traditional banking system every month.   It is so frequent, that it is a matter for insurance companies and banks... not the press or customers to know about.

Aside from the recent 80 mil SWIFT hack, there have been ATM hacks (est to the tune of 600 mil), newer more sophisticated SWIFT hacks (amounts undisclosed, NYT est to 20-40 mil), and countless more.   

There is little reporting on the amount of losses.   But for reference:  In 1991 the FDIC had to pay out 25 billion in insurance on customer deposits, 70 billion in 2008.   This is not """"small change""""  even given the total amount insured, these levels represented more than 1.5% of total deposits.   By comparison, the Bitfinex hack, at 0.8%, was big, but comparable.   And this was not evern related to uninsured theft.   The BRE-X gold scam was 6 billion.

You have to do some work finding reports of these.   Financial institutions are understandably reluctant to disclose information about them.   Businesses don't like advertising how they've been swindled, and how they've swindled others.

But it's abundantly clear that theft, fraud and security are *not* problems that are unique to Bitcoin.

To think that this is some sort of """"Bitcoin"""" issue is to ignore the real problem.  We have a hard time with trusting others with our money.   Bitcoin, and assets issues on the blockchain gives you a choice: learn how to do it yourself, or trust someone else.

In traditional markets... there's no choice at all."

1237,"To bitfinex:

That is incorrect. 

The hack occurred at 09:45am on my account. You can see from the withdrawal on the block chain. I was bailed-in after the hack.

This means that in a legal case, in the future every single person that lost coins could argue the legality of your cut off time and socialise the losses to the future point in time.
If you have not credited me with the coins that are due to me, and your subjective cut-off time of 18:00 is deemed to be legally invalid (which it is), you could be exposed for all future depositors being equally liable for all the lost coins in a re-socialisation of losses case. 
That is massive exposure compared to the deposits between the time of the actual attack and your 18:00 cut-off time. You should seriously consider this.

I’m definitely going to sue you when enough new depositors have arrived, as I am no different to any new depositor from this point forward as we all have deposited funds after the attack.

I’m not going to be the only one bailed in, each new depositor should have the same liability as me. 

I have a very good legal case as to when the hack actually occurred.

1254,"Hello! I am creating a companion for beginners, some facts that are important to the creation and support of cryptocurrency and some tips that I wish I knew before I got into crypto.

**How is cryptocurrency important to me?**

Definitions.

Fiat currency: Legal tender whose value is backed by the government that issued it. 

Cryptocurrency is a new way of transmitting money. The goal is to create a free market, in which 
exchange of goods and currency can occur without the interference of a corrupt regulatory body. In most modern countries, this is not an issue (except for banned illicit substances in the modern state, which was a primary reason bitcoin took off here in America). US citizens enjoy a wide variety of product with strong regulation and infrastructure making crypto fall into the typically technological fallacy, a complicated technology for a simple use. Cryptocurrency will probably not gain traction until the US financial system is considered untrustworthy worldwide and the need to send large amounts of capital securely to trusted parties will be needed. But as technology and the world network grows, the need for a flexible currency will become imminent and cryptocurrency has the structure and technology to support it. 

**""""It is not a matter of if, but when.""""**

Until lawmakers see cryptocurrency as a viable alternative currency and create regulation that protects the everyday consumer, bitcoin will remain in the dark. But traction has slowly been growing, and the government and banks have been taking note.

Regulation is “usually” beneficial for the modern citizen since it protects consumers from being taken advantage of by untrustworthy businesses. But in countries with unstable governments with uncontrollable inflation issues, regulation is minimal which makes trade in third world countries difficult and risky. Cryptocurrencies can fill in that gap.

Adding to that fact, many countries are expressing frustration with the US government's control over international trade. The US dollar has become the main source of currency to make trades worldwide and many states are looking to challenge its superiority (Google: China's currency war). Cryptocurrency, as a decentralized currency, does not have these issues since no organization controls the supply of cryptocurrencies.

**Current Problems and Opionions**

Cryptocurrency currently is highly speculative. There is no current utilitarian use except for transferring payments for small goods to untrusted third parties, trading on exchanges, or sending large sums to others worldwide instantaneously, which is a fairly small market.

Inside manipulators are a huge issue in cryptocurrency. BE CAREFUL TAKING FINANCIAL ADVICE FROM PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET. There are many investment firms attempting to monetize the blockchain with the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may provide no greater utilitarian use than a tested and trusted cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.

Lastly, investing into cryptocurrency is similar to investing into a open source project. Purchasing cryptocurrencies are an investment hoping that DEVELOPERS can create programs and applications that the layman will use. Only this way will cryptocurrencies will grow and develop into the iconic currency that all its proponents want it to be."

28-Day TRIG Token Crowdsale to Begin Thursday, September 8th

(ATLANTA, August 19, 2016) – Blocksafe (https://www.blocksafefoundation.com/), the first blockchain-based system to provide secure access, personal monitoring and control to owners of firearms using smart gun technology, will build out its Blocksafe blockchain using Lisk sidechain technology and will issue a new token for use on that chain called “Trigger” (TRIG). To fund this effort, the Blockchain Foundation will conduct a 28-day crowdsale, commencing on Thursday, Sept 28th , at 10 am pt.

“Blocksafe represents a revolution in managing access to firearms through the creation of a blockchain for smart gun technology,” said Blocksafe founder and CEO Kevin Barnes. “This will allow for gun owners to secure, manage and control access to who can use their firearms, disabling stolen weapons, while maintaining a decentralized database that has no central point of failure or control.”

Triggers will be the token that makes the Blocksafe blockchain work, and it will work with a planned array of smart gun technologies such as magazines, locks and other Trigger-enabled hardware including 3rd party and user-created hardware that can be 3D printed or manufactured.  

Of the 100 million Triggers that will ever exist, 30 million will be offered during the token crowdsale, which will be co-hosted by Bittrex (www.bittrex.com), the leading global alternative cryptocurrency exchange.  The crowdsale takes place over 28 days with a first-day bonus of 20 percent and accelerating price throughout the sale:

Thursday, September 8, 11 am pt, 8000 TRIG per bitcoin (24 hours)
Friday, September 9, 11 am pt,  6400 TRIG per bitcoin (lasts 7 days)
Thursday, September 16, 11 am pt,  6000 per bitcoin (7 days)
Thursday, September 23, 11 am pt, 5400 TRIG per bitcoin (7 days)
Thursday, September 30, 11 am pt, 5000 TRIG per bitcoin (7 days)
Thursday, October 7 11 am pt , crowdsale ends.

Hey reddit,

I am extremely frustrated with Coinbase, their platform and their support.  
I have held funds in their multisignature vault and wanted to withdraw them on July 7th. Due to their broken platform I was not able to do so, as the transaction was stuck in """"creating transaction"""" indefinately. The same process was working for withdrawals from this vault without issues before.  

I immediately contacted support which was not able to help me. They even had this amazing autoreply after 2 days because they didn't answer me:

I was slightly more annoyed but thought it would now be fixed soon after 6 weeks for holding the money hostage. But tuesday came and guess what... no answer from Coinbase. I am not the person to raise issues on social media to get attention on the topic, but I literally warned them and said that if they don't fix this I will feel forced to do so. I hope this post forces them to finally fix this critical issue

TL;DR: Coinbase has 50 BTC in the multisig vault that can't be withdrawn for 6 weeks because the platform is broken. They promise a fix but don't deliver within their own deadline. Outcry on social media so that the issue gets finally fixed."

I am facing the issue that my """"normal"""" wallet always takes ages to verify blocks. It literally takes 15-20 minutes OR MORE to verify the blocks. When its up and running everything is fine, shutdown is quick as well. The next time i start it up it will take ages once again though.

I am using the latest 64 bit version on Windows. I've assigned 2GB ram in the client settings, and attempted to defrag the drive i have the blocks on which did not speed it up the slightest either.

Is it some bug of the 64 bit version? Has anyone had this happen and found a fix for it? Thanks!"

1268,So which one will be the next
1269,"
Assumption1: 60 - 70% of bitcoin mining occurs in China, distributed under seperate (each &lt; 51%) names, but under one controlling China gov
Assumption2: China gov is going to act in their own self interest and not necessarily as a rational actor


Facts:
Recently Baidu pulled advertising for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 
China gov has spoken about bitcoin in the past and is aware of the technology and the potential
China gov is motivated to stop capital flight/movement out of china 


Theory:
China gov is going to create and launch its own crypto currency (lets call it chinacoin)
China gov, using ability to control the actions of miners, will overnight make bitcoin mining illegal, and simultaneously encourage miners to point their hashing power at chinacoin (new coin, high rewards etc)
They will do this just after a bitcoin difficulty adjustment. The bitcoin network cant adjust to the new low hash state until the high difficulty 2016 blocks have passed, possibly taking months until the next lower adjustment is found


Effects:
During the outage time, bitcoin blocks will fill more than usual, hosts will have an issue with mempools, any transactions relying on multiple block confirmation will take much longer or not at all, a mass exodus will cause blocks to fill more creating more pressure.
Bitcoin is effectively unusable and down, confidence in the protocol will be significantly lost

Chinacoin is here, controlled by China gov
Advertising on China websites of new chinacoin
Development of cryptocurrencies in other countries (rest of world) lessens due to lack of confidence


Advantages for China gov:
No/reduced capital flight issues
Control of all mining is within China (not external gov)
Development of cryptocurrencies actively encouraged under China gov control (consider this a developmental head start on the rest of the world)"

I made a mutate transaction from a transaction that wasn't confirmated. The mutated was broadcasted in the network but it didn't made any changes in the original transaction.

Thank you!"
1271,"So this idea has had roughly 2 minutes of brainstorming, but it could be the next big thing, who knows!

I read an article today about Google and how in 2017 they will be punishing websites that have a inline popup box, which I think is a load of shit. If a website wants to promote something with a popup, it's their fucking site, let them! If their visitors don't like it, they'll leave, and Google will detect a high bounce rate anyway and be able to demote them in their rankings.

And it got me thinking... Google have WAYYY too much control over websites. Whatever they say goes, unless you want to lose your rankings and let your entire online business go down the toilet.

And we all know, no one will ever be able to take over Google!!!

Or can we, as a collective, create a community powered search engine?

So, my 2 minute brainstorm idea is...

What if a search engine was created, and everyone has 1 vote per webpage, and you can cast your vote to a specific page that you believe is the most relevant for your search, and that is essentially how all the webpages on the internet are ranked.

Demo:

- Billy searches for """"game of thrones episodes"""" and comes across the current Google organic listings and sees Wikipedia's Game of Thrones page first. 
- He looks at the page and finds what he's looking for, so he votes for this page, which essentially says """"I found what i'm looking for on this page for the search 'game of thrones episodes'"""".
- Millions of users around the world follow the same scenario, and eventually you have a search engine which is ranked by what users have actually deemed to be useful to their query, and not what Google believes is useful.

But how do you stop people gaming the system and getting more votes? In the same way we could stop the government gaming the elections of course... by giving everyone a satoshi/token that is unique to them and unforgeable, which they can use to place their vote.

1272,"Newbie trying to switch to a non-exchange wallet. I transferred funds from my one Coinbase wallet to a wallet on my computer, but it sent the transaction twice. I now have a negative balance on Coinbase and the two transactions in my new wallet. This particular Coinbase account isn't linked to any bank info or anything, so I basically """"stole"""" around $20. Can I just transfer the amount back to Coinbase or will this cause issues? Thanks in advance. "
1273,"I got my Circle account all setup and everything is good, I buy some coin and It says Pending. I wait a good couple hours and it says complete and my balance now shows I have the coin. I come to find out that Circle lied, my bank account still says PENDING and I can't send that coin to another address. Then I see people saying that you will have to verify ID when they send you an email, some say they never needed to do that. Apparently Circle will send an email within 3-5 days. Does anyone have any experience with Circle? Also Coinbase is out of the question. Thanks "
1274,"I’m considering buying a keepkey but don’t want to use the chrome extension because I have an existing electrum wallet.  Ideally I want to be able to use the keepkey to sign transactions from my current wallet but I can’t seem to find any documentation as how to best do this.  To add another wrinkle my existing wallet is a multi-sig wallet and I’m curious as to how this would work with a keepkey added to the mix.

Looking for tips from people that use this HW wallet with electrum.

1276,"Hello,  

I really feel like the good guy paying for the bad guys, way before the hardfork I had 170 ETH with coinbase in my GDAX account, I have not done any transactions with that ETH since more than two months.

I have requested they pay me the 170 ETC they say they have for me but it just never comes.  I read that other people would get free ETC from coinbase by moving funds around.  

I trusted them and sat on it saying it would be easy for them to solve my case since I did not do anything with the funds.   

I would like to report this to the government, but don't know where to go,  any suggestions will be welcome.  I have of course worked with coinbase, but basically they just say they are working on it... all the time over and over again and again.   My deepest wish would be that this message reaches at least one of the owners, they do not seem to understand the importance of trust and honesty and establishing a relationship with the customer.    

I am very deceived by them, and will be turning away, just plain deceived they were very good until this mishap.  Louis Drapeau

1277,"Bitcoin Price Update for August 31, 2016  

Market Commentary (BTC):  

Although things were looking pretty good yesterday for near term bulls, the market once again turned south following a tag of the 580 $ resistance area.  Now price is sitting back down in the 570 - 575 $ area where it has felt so comfortable for over a month.  We are not expecting any action in the market until later in the weekend going into early next week, therefore we remain neutral on a market that is stagnant and indecisive at current levels.  We will continue to remain patient overall given a still mixed bag of technicals and some waiting time until the next fundamental catalyst (Bitcoin Core 0.13.1), however we are willing to hold our small VST ProTrade long for the time being.

Today we revisit the 6-hour chart for a look at the short to medium term prospects.  We can see that price remains flat within the pivot area, and also continue to hug volume profile PoC, while market structure vacillates between bullish and bearish.  Also note that trading volumes remain anemic and volume profile looks relatively thin on either side of the current trading range, however the A/D line is still slowly pressing to the upside so it appears as though there are still buyers around current levels. Additionally, SCMR continue to paint mixed signals as we had a potential upside reversal that was cancelled a few bars later, but now we have a re-confirmation of the reversal although there has been no follow-through in price action yet. 

Moving on to momentum we can see that the near term EMA's are almost completely flat, the 200-period SMA is still bearish, and PPO is close to signaling slightly overbought conditions despite practically no movement to the upside so far this week.  Finally, we can see that Willy and RSI both failed to push sustainably above their respective centerlines, while MACD continues to dance around it's zeroline as well.  None of these indications are all that encouraging, at least not from a near term perspective, so for now we are expecting more of the same until we get closer to the holiday weekend.  

Considering how tight the market is coiling right now, and has been for some time, we think that when a break of the symmetrical triangle/consolidation range materializes it will send some shockwaves of volatility through the market.  The key levels to watch are now 540 $ on the downside and 630 $ on the upside, so keep an eye out for a break of one of these levels over the next few weeks.  A break lower would likely take us down into the MT ProTrade add zone just below 500 $, while a breakout higher would likely send prices up to more significant resistance in the form of the OTE short zone around 700 $.  For the time being, however, we continue to sit on the sidelines in order to wait for more favorable setups.

GLGT!

1279,"Hey, guys. Few days ago I've thought about some applied use of Bitcoin in real project, and here is what I think may work - https://pavlovdog.github.io/Pazzer

This is something about imageboard/Reddit/9GAG/etc, but with a few features:

1) You need to pay for adding a new post - but the price is really low, much cheaper than 1 cent. It's a reward for administration, no ads and other shit. I think it should work.

2) When you adding a post, you attach your bitcoin adress, so now, liking will be the same as payment. But again, this is micropayment. This is something about crowdfounding, but you can earn money even on good meme, huehuehue.

3) I think, comments should work about the same.

4) Your like/post will be added only after the transaction is in the blockchain.


What do you think about it? Amendments and criticism are welcome.

P.S. This prototype don't even has a back-end, it's just an illustration of idea (AngularJS + Semantic UI).
P.P.S. Sorry for my English, rush B CYKA BLYAD!"

1281,"x-post from my \/r/changetip [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/50u4y4/bitcoin_withdrawal_pending_for_over_20_hours/)

&gt;i withdrew my balance yesterday and it's still pending, it said it can take up to 24 hours. why does it take up to 24 hours just to process a bitcoin withdrawal? this should be a straightforward instant transaction from my changetip wallet to my personal wallet as it has been for accounts with other providers. you can deposit tips instantly but not withdraw instantly? waiting up to 24 hours is unacceptable for a withdrawal of your own bitcoin in this day and age, and i'm wary of how [stripped](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/4p7rw4/deposit_by_card_withdraw_by_gyft_and_paypal_were/) changetip has become.

&gt;i sent in a support request to changetip yesterday too after waiting over 5 hours for my withdrawal and still haven't gotten an email reply.

&gt;withdrawals taking this long has been the case [8](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/3wa3ca/withdrawal/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/4r2apn/how_long_for_withdrawals/) months ago too, the latter took over 3 days, so it's gotten worse...

edit: i got the withdrawal and email reply minutes after posting this in /r/Bitcoin and total time it took was ~26 hours."
1282,"Bitcoins image have suffered badly because of high profile hacks of exchanges and Ponzi Schemes. In it's current state bitcoin services are not dependable. The fact that bitcoin itself is intact does not help much. The services overlaying bitcoin need to be secure aswell in order for bitcoin to be useful.

I'm proposing a solution that would make it possible for services holding bitcoins to prove how big part of their assets are in cold storage without revealing how much assets they actually hold. There might be technical modifications that would allow this solution to be more decentralised, more private, more efficient or more smart and I welcome those. I hope this layout would be a good framework.

For every new account in a service, a new wallet is created. This wallet will require two out of three parties. To sign any transactions. One party is the service. One party is the user and one party is a newly established foundation/company. Ususally, more than 90% of a users funds will be put into this wallet, but it depends on the service.

There could be one or more foundations/companies like this and their daily operations typically are run entirely by software. 

The normal case is that the service  is the one that withdraws money from the cold storage, maybe their clientbase has shrunk or they need more liquid captial. When they want money from the cold storage, they tell the foundation what accounts they want to move how much assets from. The foundation then pseudonomosly publishes the request to withdraw assets and then waits for a given amount of time, like 48 hours.

Both the client and the service can monitor all requests to the foundation. If any unauthorized requests are made to the foundation, they can tell the foundation to cancel them.

The foundation has a few more features, for example, it can initiate a move of funds to a new account if the client loses it's private key. This also has a delay. The client can also directly contact the foundation and ask them to withdraw all their funds.

Every service on the internet will commit to a certain level of cold storage of their own choice. They can generate a badge that shows their level of commitment, thees badges should be considered similar to credit scores or fair trade etc. Services that don't commit to a high level of cold storage should be shun by the community. The badges could be on different levels, like a 10% of assets in a 8 hour delay and 80% of assets in a 7 days delay etc.

Because the users have a pseudonymous key to their cold storage. They can check if the service honors their commitment, not honouring the commitment for a single user should be considered fraud. IE they should have atleast their percentage of every clients assets in cold storage all the time.

This service would be good for exchanges, because it would rid the market of unprofessional actors, and it would help them to avoid being hacked, something that often ends up in a bankruptcy and lots of greif.

It would be good for users because they would know what services to trust. If someone is trying to do a ponzi scheme, they could also notice and prevent it.

The foundations could charge a fee for their features to the services or maybe it could be decentralized and live on the blockchain somehow."

1294,"Hello! I've been into Bitcoin for almost three years now but since I found out about it I have used just browser wallets. I recently heard it's not so safe to store them in a browser wallet so I was wondering.. Is the paper wallet safer than any other one? I'm looking to store BTC for a long time. So I've got the following questions: 



1. If any website goes down (including the one I'm going to generate the paper wallet from), will my BTC still be there? 

2. If that's the case, how can I get my funds back into a wallet? Can I get them on ANY web/offline wallet back or just on specific ones? 

3. Can I simply print it from my home printer or do I need a special type of paper/printer?

4. Why exactly is it safe? Can it be stolen? What are the risks of having it stored on a paper? 



I'm going to save BTC for a while and I decided to find a better and safer way to store them than the web browser wallet. I have already set up an old laptop with a Live CD Linux which removes every chance as soon as I shut it down, so I guess keyloggers aren't a problem anymore as I'm using that laptop JUST for cryptocurrencies. Any other suggestions for safe storage are appreciated. Thank you for taking your time to answer me."

1 - What is your favorite exchange for this sort of a transaction and why?  I'm in the US, if that helps.  Also: I want to maximize my privacy as much as possible, with the understanding that I'm buying from an account in my name of course.

2 - Since this will be large ($20,000) from a U.S. bank (where transactions over $10,000 are generally flagged), what can I do to make sure that it goes smoothly?  I don't want to look like a cocaine dealer or whatever.

3 - If it does NOT go smoothly, does anyone have experience that would tell me in what way it would go bad?  Like, will the rest of my bank account be seized?  What's the usual set of problems to anticipate?

4 - Once I have the BTC in a BTC wallet, how easy (and expensive) will it be to anonymize it in the future?  Obviously it will all begin in my name since I'm buying from my bank.  But does anyone have experience tumbling large amounts like this?

5 - Has anyone had any experience with tax issues related to holding large amounts of BTC?  If the value increases threefold again next year, will I have to pay taxes like a capital gain?  My accountant has no clue at all, but someone here might.

6 - Lastly, even though this is a BTC forum I wonder if anyone would recommend any other crypto currencies as well?  Maybe I'll put 15 into BTC and 5 into something else if it comes highly recommended.

THANK YOU for your time.  I am excited to join the Bitcoin community and I hope that this is just a first step. "
1298,"So there's a lot of discussion on bitcoin's hashrate playing a role in its price, and its so dang true. I see bitcoin's price action moving steadily upwards forever (so hold) because as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make sense to sell now. This keeps getting more and more rare, and neither the US Central Bank, or any central bank can stop it at this point. We'll get to the moon, but with one acceleration at a time...

(Humor): How would I play this out? I'd pull the trigger if I see an anchor-toss as we're approaching the mid $700s, as the upside-down kettle will limit my potential losses to that price-range.

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin &amp; Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)
* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&amp;index=1&amp;list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)

**Key properties of bitcoin**

* **Limited Supply** (there will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://plot.ly/~BashCo/5.embed?share_key=ljQVkaTiHXjX2W41UiqzCn))
* **Open source** (You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin))
* **Decentralized** (Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works)
* **Permissionless** (No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network of your own free will, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking.  This makes it a truly global payment platform)
* **Censorship resistant** (No one can censor or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point))
* **Push system** (there are no chargebacks in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them)
* Designed to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoins?

You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, more can be found [here](http://howtobuybitcoin.io/) and [here](https://howtobuybitcoins.info/#!/).  

* [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en)
* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/) 
* [Mycelium LocalTrader](http://mycelium.com/lt/help.html) 
* [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) 
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) 
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) 

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  Also, [Lawnmower](https://lawnmower.io/) is also a handy way to make small recurring purchases of bitcoin.  If you would like your paycheck auotmatically converted to bitcoin use [Cashila](https://www.cashila.com/) or [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Here are a couple useful sites ([bitkoin.io](http://bitkoin.io/), [preev.com](http://preev.com/btc/usd)) that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google """"1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"""".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can """"be your own bank"""" and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka """"bitcoin banks"""" which will hold the bitcoins for you.


* If you prefer to """"be your own bank"""" and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).  If you prefer easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/), [Case Wallet](https://choosecase.com), or [KeepKey](http://www.keepkey.com/) is recommended.  A more advanced option is to secure them yourself using [paper wallets](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) generated offline.  

* If you prefer to let bitcoin banks manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Earning bitcoins

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.

* [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins)
* [Coinality job board](https://coinality.com/)
* [Bitgigs job board](http://bitgigs.com/)
* [xbtfreelancer.com](https://www.xbtfreelancer.com/)

You can also earn bitcoins by participating as a market maker to allow users to perform CoinJoin transactions with your bitcoins for a small fee (requires you to already have some bitcoins)

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μL) or micrometre (μm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial """"slang"""" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

**Welcome to the Bitcoin community and the new decentralized economy!**"
1307,"You may be familiar with our initiative from our many ads or you have seen the weekly documentary titled **Mr. Robot**. 
(Which, while mildly entertaining for people of below average intelligence, does not paint our company in a fair light and we have cease and desist / takedown orders pending)

Bio:  I am a SVP at ECorp, I've worked for Mr. Philip Price, our CEO, Tyrell Wellick, Terry Colby and others for 9 years.  

Along with Hal Finney and Satoshi, Terry and I were early creators of Bitcoin. Since then we have moved beyond Bitcoin to more advanced private ledgers technology.  We call this """"Blockchain 2.0""""^TM, The Internet of Money^TM.  

My computer science credentials are extensive.  After completing pre-law courses and working in the ECorp compliance department I was moved to IT.  I manage a technical staff of over 2000 people including hundreds of developers.  

My personal technical skills are significant: I have familiarity with 2-factor, DOS, Basic, basic HTML (basic is a language, basic html refers to my skill level with html), Authy, Word, Excel, Gmail, I am an expert-level user of several apps such as Spotify and have made posts on blogs that use Drupal or Wordpress.  I've used advanced programs such as disk defrag on my (supermodel) girlfreind's laptop.

Conservatively speaking I'd say my tech skills are on a level with /u/nullc however I only just heard of him a couple weeks ago so will need to research more.   I have over 100 commits on the core protocol (for ECoin).

As a corporate officer I am entitled to use of the officers only gym, track and dining room.


**About ECoin**

We are pleased at the progress ECoin is making and we think that the Bitcoin community will absolutely love it.  

We'd love to have you on board our team!


**Some benefits of ECoin:**

- with ECoin *we control the ledger*, blockchain is in hands you know and trust and not subject to the whims of users

- ECoin offers *built in compliance tools* such as the ability to reverse or block transactions for criminals, suspects and money launderers 

- ECoin is *not limited in suppliy to 21 million* or any other arbitrary number.  As a serious financial institution, we are aware that there will be far more demand than 21 million.  Therefor ECoin's supply is indefinite, just like the US dollar.  Some radicals think this isn't a benefit but 100 years of economic growth in the US shows otherwise

- ECoin is *not subject to disagreements or development debates*; as you saw a lot of Bitcoin development time wasted discussing """"scaling"""", we already have solved those matters and decisions are made in corporate offices by experienced computer scientists and economists, not simple anonymous handles on GitHub (as a side note, if any Bitcoin developers are determined qualified enough to work on ECoin, make no mistake that there will not be debate, it will be clear who they work for, whether we pay them or not) 

- ECoin is *environmentally friendly*:  using a custom issuance mechanism, ECoin is able to avoid the challenges faced by Bitcoin's archaic proof of work system (side note, one of our proposed bills will allow for carbon offsets for mining)

- Unlike Bitcoin, *ECoin can't be hacked*.  As you know, Bitcoin has been hacked multiple times.  It's not my area of expertise but my understanding is that a fault in the ledger caused by Core Developers was the cause of the MtGox hack and others.  With ECoin you have an actual, stable, trusted ledger run by a company who you know on our servers.  Should there ever be a hack, ECoin software will fork the hacked funds away and revert them to the rightful owner.  Why support hackers?

- When people pull out their wallet and look at an address they want to know that the amount of coins shown are accurate.  Bitcoin has no way of knowing what value an address has other than the blockchain...which isn't even controlled by anyone!  No offense, but that's crazy.  With ECoin, what you see is what you get, or as we techies say """"wysiwyg"""", the balance shown is validated by us.  Every time.

- ECoin has seemless integration with all the products and services you know and trust from ECorp: mortgages, health care, smart contracts etc....all tied to your ECoin wallet

- ECoin is offering a SKD and for app developers to build on top of our platform.  This is where the Bitcoin community can help as it has occured to us that some of you may have technical knowledge or understanding of ledgers.  Once you pay the $1600 registration fee and file with FinCen and your state regulator as a PECSD (Prospective ECoin Softward Developer) you will be scheduled for a back ground check, review of political affiliations and a drug test, if all of this goes well, within 12-18 weeks you will receive  approval to be a FECSD (Full ECoin Software Developer) and be authorized to present your ideas and applications to our technology review committee [please note that all technology developed under this licence is the property of ECorp]

- ECoin does not intend to hoard this technology, we are allowing its use by a consortium of major banks 

- Bitcoin is not backed by anything.  ECoin is backed by the full faith and credit of one of the world's largest most well known companies.

- Today we are working on providing regulatory clarity and assisting in helping lawmakers make laws that work to govern this technology.  Together with our partners at the SEC, FTC and others as well as our counterparts in the EU and Asia we have created a framework we think works.  Without more regulation now, inevitably there will be even worse laws later.  Whether you love or just like ECoin and still believe in Bitcoin, supporting these regs makes sense.  It's time to grow up and distance yourselves from Silk Road and other bad actors.  With increased clarity we all win.

We know that not everyone will support ECoin, there will be some """"purists"""" who think that a blockchain should be some sort of permanent record that is difficult to change *even if there is lost money or crime involved*.  We at ECorp don't find this any more serious than the people claiming Ron Paul was right about the economy or that the Gulf of Tonkin was caused by a false flag operation.  The era of the wingnuts has passed and CryptoCurrency^TM is here to stay.  In an alliance with law enforcement and through patents and other means the old world of Bitcoin is gone.  (In the words of my favorite president, GW Bush """"You are either with us or against us."""")

Don't take this evolution as a loss, see it as a victory.  The road paved by Satoshi, Hal Finney, me, Terry Colby and the other inventors of this technology has you to thank for its early growth.  We are eternally grateful as we move forward in the next steps, with or without you.

Let's work together to make CryptoCurrency^TM a real innovation in technology!

AMA "
1308,"So for about a month now (only took a proper interest recently) I have been looking into bitcoin whenever I had internet at Uni and while the geek in me loves the conceptband realisation the pessimist says it will die out. I had that 1 usd worth of bitcoin for a while and have no actual use for it. 

I just moved to Budapest, and expected to find more than a mere half a dozen places where they sorta-kinda take btc. Most people here don't even know what it is while in my little Serbia they at least heard about it. 

My question / concern is with how will I be able to buy bread in the morning with btc one day? And average person visiting the sub will do a 180 instantly. It just does not seem approachable and user friendly. It is not stupidproof.




Tl;dr how does bitcoin plan on becoming actively relevant and used?"

1311,I have around $400 I can invest into bitcoin right now. Is it worth buying right now or waiting and seeing if it gets cheaper?
1312,"Title says it all. Does anyone know how I can purchase bitcoin using venmo? Also, is there is a way that is indirect (Venmo --&gt; _____ --&gt; Bitcoin) what would be the best way to do that?  "
1313,"Has it been confirmed that the website was actually blocked? If it was, it speaks to the tech-savviness of the LBC community in Russia (and perhaps suggests that the number of traders is small and organized).

1314,"Lawnmower got all it's valid stars from being an amazing, let's turn our change into Bitcoin. It then [pivoted](http://imgur.com/a/53cvN) and personally I can't get my monies from it. And, most importantly is raking all the good graces of its original purpose and banking off that.

The same service it provided once upon a time, was what it was graded on. Note it has a new service and it should be graded independent of that. 

My argument is, they should have discontinued and moved on.

Edit: link to my complaint and their response"
1315,Can anyone please tell me what kind of identification is required to buy bitcoin with Circle? A simpl e scan of your ID or do they ask for selfie or webcam activation?
1316,"Am I missing something? This new bitmain pool called BTC.com is a 0% PPS pool. Their site, pool.btc.com, shows they have found no blocks yet and they are currently hashing at 1.15PH/s. 

I remembered seeing a block that was relayed by them a day or two ago, I went back to find it and I did, block 430723 by BTC.com. On their normal btc.com site they are showing that this pool has found 55 blocks this month and is currently hashing at ~25PH/s.

Am I missing something?"
1317,"Apologies if this is a repeat post, I'm not a regular in this community, but I was curious and wanted to ask a question:

I'm a young adult, working professional, with a stable career. I'm not rich or poor - my SO and I own a house that is about the average price in our city. My income is mostly from my paycheck, plus I earn some rental income. I'm saving for retirement, have a few investments, and such. My expenses are same as most everyone's - mortgage, car payment, groceries, clothing, entertainment. I certainly shop online for time to time, especially clothes and gifts.

Should I be considering getting and using Bitcoin? I'm somewhat aware of what it is - a decentralized cryptocurrency that is not regulated by any government. I could see this having a lot of appeal for people - for example, people who have a need to buy things from a lot of different companies, or people using it in their business, people facilitating a lot of online transactions, etc. I've heard the technology is amazing, secure, and will have a huge impact on all currencies around the world, and how transactions are conducted/regulated.

What do I, your average working professional, stand to gain from using Bitcoin? How do you use it and what do you like to use it for? What makes people concerned about getting involved in Bitcoin now, rather than waiting for it to become more mainstream? I mean, if my country's currency gets taken over by Bitcoin and my paycheck starts to be Bitcoin instead of dollars, OK, cool. There's probably reasons that could be a good thing. But what is the difference that that will make in my life? Is Bitcoin much different than a regular fiat currency? If so, how?

So I guess my questions are, 1) what are the advantages of getting involved in using Bitcoin now, rather than later when it becomes more mainstream? And 2) for your average person who just pays their mortgage, buys coffees, buys groceries, saves for retirement, etc., what difference will Bitcoin make in my life if I do decide to use it?"
1318,"Without any announcement coinbase.com decided to lower the deposit limits! Down to $400 from $10,000 deposit limit. Just wondering if other people are affected as well? Why was this change not announced?"
1319,"I initiated a sell on coinbase and the bank transfer should have been completed 2 days ago but on my history page, it still shows up as Pending, and the funds have not been received. Is this cause for concern and should I contact anyone?"
1320,"Just got off the phone with paypal support about and old business account I have . I was downgrading my account because i never use it. I told the rep i might do a business using bitcoin.. they said if i do a business with it to contact them because they explore options using bitcoin on case by case basis, unofficially. Something is brewing there for sure. "

1322,"I ordered a product from their site (http://cryptosteel.com/) today, was prompted to pay, and selected to do so in bitcoin. I sent the bitcoin to the right address and was told that I would receive a confirmation email with my order details after. An hour passed, then two, now it's been 5 hours and I've received no email.

Any chance this site is not the legitimate one? And if it is, what gives? I've heard that they don't respond to emails often so I figure i'd try reddit to see if I've been bamboozled.

Thanks."
1323,"Hey! I am a PayPal user, and am researching about Bitcoin. I found this reply to a Bitcoin pro thread on this subbeddit, and it really got me thinking about Bitcoin:

""""For the consumer bitcoin is a nightmare. It basically removes all protection from the consumer. 

A seller can run with your money and there's no recourse. 

Paypal is 100x better (not even hyperbole) for the consumer at the moment. You have superb protection when paying with paypal. 

The consumer is who a currency/payment portal should protect. The seller is what bitcoin (currently) protects. 

Completely backwards.""""


Any counter argument or such? 

Thanks for the replies."
1324,"So for a long time I have kept my coins on exchanges and with circle/coinbase/etc. I was a bit afraid of storing them in a wallet on my computer because my computers were old and I wasn't sure about their security state.

Can anyone give me a link on how to properly create a secure suite of wallets for my various coins?

How about some advice on security in general in terms of a new laptop?

Thanks."
1325,"Sorry, I don't get it. Do we see stories of all the people who do buy bitcoins directly getting hassled by the feds because the bitcoins which they originally purchased were then used to buy drugs/guns whatever by someone else down the line after they spent them? I don't see how there is anything to worry about legally, just because you are the original purchaser, as long as none of the wallets the coins go into after your original purchasing wallet can be linked to you. Or even as long as the final wallet which made the illegal purchase cannot be proven that it was you who owns it. 

Otherwise, it seems like there would be tons of stories of people who bought bitcoins  facing federal investigation at some point, because somewhere along the line some coins they spent went to someone who then bought something illegal and got caught? I just don't see how it creates any legal liability at all or why investigators would even waste their time making the trace to the originating point."
1326,"Hey r/bitcoin,

I'm new to bitcoin, and new to tor, but not completely inept with computers. 
Having said that I am getting rapidly lost in the wealth of information that there is out there.
My question is what is necessary for me to use Bitcoin to the highest possible degree of anonymity? As in, what things to I need to set up etc.
I have the latest version of Tor installed of course, and I know how to and am using a VPN, but past this I have little idea what to do.
Could people possibly help me out/give me some pointers?
The wallet I was planning on using is Bitcoin Core, and it's nearly downloaded all the way (am having some issues so would be open to alternative wallet suggestions).

TL;DR tell me what I need to do to use my bitcoin wallet anonymously"
1327,"What if we were to organize  and ether monthly  or biannual  hold day?

It would  consist of people  buying at least  .01 bitcoin  and placing  it in their holding spot. It would be a good way to have a rolling  spin on the coin market. Plus habit  behaviors are good for attention  to the coin.

Would the community  be willing  to perform  such events?"
1328,"Want to exchange my BTC for USD. I see some people offering Paypal, and I also see some people offer gift cards. Very interested in the giftcard option sicne it pays out almost double the value, only question is has anyone done this? Tips? Is it legit or do you think its a stolen giftcard. Guy is a reputable trader it seems. I just dont want to end up like this guy https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3vd9h7/just_got_arrested_for_buying_stolen_gift_cards/"

How should  I safely use it to buy coins and store it in it?



"
1330,"I've been approached by a very enthusiastic group to join a new business venture in the US to issue gold backed tokens secured on the Bitcoin blockchain. This seems like a fantastic business but there are clearly significant regulatory considerations that concern me, especially in the US.

I understand that such a service would likely be a money transmitter that is required to required to register as such with FinCEN and in all 50 states. I'm basing that on:

* [FinCEN Ruling on PM Broker](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2015-R001.pdf)
* [FinCEN Guidance on Users, Administrators &amp; Exchanges](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf)
* [Coindesk Article](http://www.coindesk.com/fincen-rules-commodity-backed-token-services-are-money-transmitters/)

If such is the case, what are the extent of such a company's requirements for conducting KYC? Is it limited to just clients that interact directly with the business for the issuance and redemption of tokens? Or does it extend to any and all third parties that end up own the tokens? 

The later seems impossible.

Also, is there anyway for such a business to somehow avoid being classified as a money transmitter? Could this be possible if the business did not actually sell the tokens, but rather just issued them to people that deposit gold into its custody?

I would really appreciate any advice or tips for who to speak with on this. Thank you."

Mtgox Trustee Kobayashi have been rejected our claims for cash we sent to the Mtgox Polish Bank for deposits! Has he even checked that Polish MtgCOCK Bank Account??? How he can rejected our claims if he """"have"""" checked that Bank?? I sent him proof from My bank, receipts etc but no answer even at this September 28, 2016 meeting! So we have to wait for March 2017 now then Septembar again and then 2018 and so on???
I sent by register post to Japan district court my claim for cash  he rejected but I haven't got any answer yet!
They accepted the BTC that were on my MTgox account but  not the cash that never arrived to my MTgox account that I sent on Mtgox Polish Account for deposit!
So, what did that Kobayashi did all this years?? What did he investigate?? Did he just read the amount on the screen on our mtgox accounts and that's all and now just taking our money for his """"HARD"""" work and keep delaying case so he can get even more of our money??
Anyone with same problem?

I want to send money (Fiat) from Europe to Australia without incurring bank charges and waiting times of up to a week.

So I used breadwallet but moved to Copay due to multiplatform support.

I was considering to make it multisig for more security; Laptop and Phone.

The issue is I tend to format/reset my laptop every 3-4 or 6 months. And one is overdue...

I wanted to ask: I assume CoPay will each 'devices' a unique restore key. I can use the one for my PC practically endlessly to restore then do transactions when I format it? 

If thats not the case can you explain how will it work etc?

They inject their address into the text field and money is sent to them, not the address you intended. Money is gone, unable to ever get back.  There were also some that changed QR codes on websites.

Doing most of your bitcoin related activities on an offline computer is something I had to get accustomed to.

1372,"A lighting channel transaction(s) seems simple enough, A sends incremented commitments to pay into an account that COULD be refunded but only at some time in the future (which B has agreed to).  

This process is reversible to a certain amount of """"turns"""" or """"days"""" that gets decremented each time the payments reverse for the duration of the initial time-lock.

Players/participants send commitments via some communication method.  

The process is backed by the initial total bitcoin but the commitments aren't fulfilled until the """"end"""", so the updating is instant (lighting).

A poker hand seem full-filled by this, where as developers of decentralized/mental poker implementations are looking for faster block-chains, a lighting hand allows """"bets"""" via (ie text/sms) communication to be committed without waiting for block-chain confirmation. 

Transactions of this sort would be considered ideal money in the sense that the commitments back and forth are perfectly backed by their stated/declared value (yet often no bitgold would need to actually move).

"
1373,"Assuming he is still alive, what's you guess as to what this genius has been up to? "
1374,"**Claim or Refund**

There is a function described in [this paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ranjit/papers/poker.pdf) referred to as “claim or refund”.  My understanding of it is that participants enter escrow with the ability to refund until all players involved have participated.  Once the escrow entry round is complete the pool of equity created is distributed based on the agreements in which the participated entered the escrow (in this case the result of a poker hand). 

For poker, players escrow their role and insurance, and the payouts can be “securely” evaluated and executed via verification contract.  

I've simplified this a bit, but that is the basic primitive I am thinking about.

**“Claim or Refund” with Crowdsale**

With this function in mind I think it should be obvious that crowd sales for projects be set up in a way that if a target goal isn't reached that investors can “press a button” and get their initial investment back.  

That said, if the target goal is reached, the developer should be allotted the time/chance to fulfill the requirements of the investment. 

The investor's equity should be timelocked until the developers deadline, but with the ability to call for a refund provided the fund-raising goal hasn't been reached yet.

**Secureness in Crowdsale**

We can think of a poker hand that is sent to a verification contract at the end of play.  If it IS possible to get such verification that can automatically and fairly distribute the funds in regards to the winners and losers of the hand then such an agreement and the outcome is quite “quantifiable”.

Other crowdsales are quite abstract in this sense.  They promise to bring a design or whitepaper to fruition but with no real or strong metric for success.

We could see with the former example, there is the possibility of setting up at least some part of a project in a quantifiable way that a smart contract could properly determine the success of the project/developer. 

This would be secure for the investor. 

On the other hand, there could be projects that offer some abstract idea of success and even especially ask for some otherwise seemingly arbitrary/unfixed amount of money.  This would be a crowdsale that is not so secure for the investor. 


**Decentralization of Crowdsale Projects**

Projects could be written in the form of problem solving outlines/designs in such a way that completion of certain aspects or steps is perfectly quantifiable, and so it could be said that in this sense a good design will cause the project to build itself.

1377,"Hi all,

what do you think about the following possible scenario?

I think funds might be in danger, if the following sequence of events happens:

1. segwit activates on mainnet
2. BTCs get deposited into segwit address/UTXOs. These are easily found by monitoring UTXOs with ANYONECANSPEND flag set.
3. the attacker finds **any** service X that (A) did not upgrade their full node to verify segwit yet, and (B) waits for too few or zero confirmations
4. the attacker manages to mine a block containing transactions that spend all ANYONECANSPEND UTXO he could find to his account at service X (violating segwit signature checks)
5. attacker manages to sell the bitcoins on X before the block gets orphaned by other miners

While correct segwit miners will not accept the block mined in 4., non-segwit full-nodes will accept it until orphaned by other blocks.
This leaves a time window open for the miner to execute 5.

Conclusion: services satisfying neither condition (A) nor (B) should be publicly identified and urged to do so.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule

**Divide and conquer.** 
Divide and rule (or divide and conquer, from Latin dīvide et īmpera) in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people.[1]

Traiano Boccalini cites """"divide et impera"""" in La bilancia politica[2] as a common principle in politics. The use of this technique is meant to empower the sovereign to control subjects, populations, or factions of different interests, who collectively might be able to oppose his rule. Machiavelli identifies a similar application to military strategy, advising in Book VI of The Art of War[3](Dell'arte della guerra),[4] that a Captain should endeavor with every art to divide the forces of the enemy, either by making him suspicious of his men in whom he trusted, or by giving him cause that he has to separate his forces, and, because of this, become weaker."

5)Yahoo account key, 5 times
6)circle verification code, 3 times at 7:26 am, 7:27, and 7:30 and then 0.8 BTC was transferred out of my account to someone else.

It seems like they had to wait for me to open my I-phone 6 before they could act. Like they could not see the verification codes they requested unless I had the phone open. 

Any thoughts?

1386,"Decentral blockchain technologies have many advantages when it comes to sustainability because they are determined mathematically and (ideally) can not be influenced by subjective opinions of some participants.
However, this causes different problems. For instance, human fallibility will lead to """"lost wallets"""", which will result in """"lost coins"""". 
In fact, the amount of Bitcoins is restricted to 21 million, it could only shrink as soon as every Bitcoin is mined. 

From the economic perspective, this could cause a deflationary nature. As soon as there are some coins left, the system could be kept alive and it seems very unlikely that every single coin will be lost in a relevant amount of time.

How do you think about economic or technical influences of this scenario?

1389,"First of all I am going to apologize for what may be viewed as a noob question on here but I am interested in learning your opinions on this.

Assume I am using a blockchain.info wallet. This is (hopefully) reasonably well connected and will prevent most sybil attacks or variations thereof where an attacker trys to get you to connect to malicious nodes. I am not concerned about an entity controlling over 50% of the network, although I recognize that this would be very problematic. I am also not concerned about those with very significant hashing power attempting this attack.

How feasible is it for an attacker to effectively double spend bitcoin? And what kind of hashing power would they need to have? Most of the attacks I can find information on seem to require the attacker to be able to mine his or her own block or have some agreement with a miner to do this for them. How feasible would it be for someone to mine their own block for a double spend attack in current conditions without the help of a dedicated miner?"

Further damage came when he openly advocated revolution and supported 2 failed forks.

So what happened to Bitcoins fallen hero? Was Gavin just a bitter man who was outclassed by more capable developers or a 'plant' to disrupt Bitcoin from within?

1400,"I am wrapping my head around segwit, and I think I have """"reverse-engineered"""" why there is that """"discount factor"""" (=4) in the segwit consensus formula, that effectively reads as:

      4*legacyBlockSize + witnessDataSize &lt;= 4MB.

My logical """"derivation"""" is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5a3lud/z/d9e818g).

Now my remaining questions are:

**Q.1**: """"Why exactly '4'""""?

A related question is this:

**Q.2**: """"When we take a typical TX mix of this year 2016 and imagine we mapped it to bitcoin-0.13.1 with segwit, then how much bytes would that occupy in legacyBlockData area and witness data area together, if they occupied 1MB when shaped w/o segwit in legacyBlockData alone? What is 'storage penalty' in percent for an avg. TX mix?""""

So my question is NOT: """"How much more TXs can you transmit with segwit using 2016's TX mix?"""" I know the answer to this is """"+70%..+100%"""" or """"an equivalent of 1.7 to 2MB of legacy TX data"""" (dpdt. on assumptions).

This is an entirely different question.

My Q.2 above is asking for HDD space efficiency of the new world (incl. segwit) compared to the old world (today). I do expect segwit and legacy block data together to be somewhat less efficient than today's situation, but what percentage of required extra space are we talking about (based on today's TX mix)? +3%? +10%? +50%? +200%?

My last question: If the answer to Q.2 is less than """"+300%"""", then my Q.3 is:

**Q.3**: """"Why was '4' chosen as discount factor? Because this is the 'worst case' kinda overhead (efficiency loss) expected w.r.t. Q.2 (knowing that Q.2 was asking for typical case, not worst case)?""""

-----

Annex:

Of course I know that the whole discount factor is a result of the desire for a softfork. With a hardfork we could eliminate that factor altogether (4--&gt;1) and define a simple limit on 

      legacyBlockSize + witnessDataSize &lt;= n MB, e.g. n = 2.

So my additional question:    
""""If we anyway require 95% miner hash majority for segwit SF activation, and if we anyway have a huge agreement in the eco-system on segwit, why not doing it as a HF without that unpleasant discount factor? Does really anybody think that someone will fork Bitcoin w/o segwit as of 0.13.0? Who should that be and why?""""

I think the opposite is true:

By replacing

      4*legacyBlockSize + witnessDataSize &lt;= 4MB  (SF)

by

      legacyBlockSize + witnessDataSize &lt;= 2MB  (HF)

Agreement level will likely be much higher.

Just trying to understand.

*PS: I tried to convince to accept 0.13.1 (on rbtc) because of segwit and LN preparation and Bitcoin's future, but was not too successful. So I am not as """"evil"""" as you may think.*"

Even if the transactions are just being pulled in and out of storage, Im not sure we can say that Bitcion is ready for that kind of volume yet. If someone could inform me that would be great.

I have read that HIVE wallet supports the same seed provided by bread wallet but as of now, HIVE wallet is no longer in service. This is where my question begins, what if similar to Hive, bread wallet were to go out of business/shut down service/ removed from app store?

How do I recover my funds with the 12 word phrase IF I lose my device and bread wallet is out of business?

1416,"From November 17, the merchants of the Parisian « Passage du Grand Cerf » will welcome Bitcoin, the digital distributed currency already used by million of people all over the world. The Paris district of Sentier and Montorgueil had already two Bitcoin-friendly shops, the Sof’s Bar on rue Saint-Sauveur and the Brasserie Ô Caire on rue du Caire, not to mention the famous « Maison du Bitcoin » opened in 2014.

Built circa 1825, the « Passage du Grand Cerf » is a protected historical monument in Paris. A true architectural case with a unique mix of iron and glass materials and woodwork, it is known as the highest canopy in Paris (12 m height) and was the place of many shooting, including a sequence of Louis Malle’s « Zazie dans le Métro » in 1960. Located in the heart of the trendy quartier of Montorgueil, the « Passage du Grand Cerf » is a commercial Gallery with 25 retailers, creative workshop and “bistrots”. Far from uniform consumption habits, you will, in this eclectic and stylish universe discover some creators master pieces, trendy decoration pieces, fashion and sophisticated accessories and a wild selection of unique or collector pieces. Both with tradition and bohemian taste, hype and offbeat, this Passage leads you out of  the box. A « coup-de-cœur » address to be discovered, with or even without bitcoin in your pocket!  

An early and friendly partner,  the « Cercle du Coin » and the « Maison du Bitcoin » as the anchor of Bitcoin in Paris (with the support of  Bitpay) are happy to have coached the « Passage du Grand Cerf » in its way to Bitcoin.

«  Le CERCLE DU COIN » is the leading Association for French-speaking Bitcoin pros. It was launched in January 2016 by 7 founders coming from 3 countries. It has now more than 50 members in France, but also Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, in the USA and in Hong-Kong : young companies related to Bitcoin, analysing or developing blockchains, academics, developers, lawmen, media or blog writers, all of them willing to share ideas and committed to support projects about the distributed money, with no banks and no borders.

Desperately announce a scheme..Voluntary Disclosure scheme where anybody can disclose whatever black money they have . pay a flat 40% tax on it and walk away without any criminal penalty..

collected nearly 2.2 billion...

but public was largely unaware of this activity as the masses dont pay tax(they come under non tax paying slab).

So here we are..How to create a huge publicty stunt as well as claim they have finished black money business?

Announce 500 and 1000 rs invalid within 6 hours..the masses run panic and small time black money holders are shocked to know they money they have in basement are not valid anymore and they cant take it to bank to exchange for new notes as they have to show proof..

btc-e.com is a bitcoin exchange I'm sure many of us have come across.

I googled ALWAYS EFFICENT LLP and got [this](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC394172) information. This LLP has two designated members:

* ESPARON, Sandra Gina
* JOUBERT, Evaline Sophie

If you google their names, several links come up relating to offshore companies and the **Panama Papers leak**.

On the 3rd November 2015, ALWAYS EFFICIENT LLP was issued a warning to declare their annual confirmation statement. They obliged.

On the 27th September 2016, they were issused a [warning](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-prod/docs/lX7nEBnEL7SponhKkYJviLgKv0Ka89X3B4WlGSA66-0/application-pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAJHZHE6IGBH4OUFCA&amp;Expires=1478649133&amp;Signature=t6gMj90BOD5EDHh0zepX9lKEe6g%3D&amp;x-amz-security-token=FQoDYXdzEDcaDPMFMBeZpbrmH0hNeyKcA4f%2BofsAzBQafRf%2Bk6inVvUpA4vfJZmVSTqKy6sN8IKFWkslq7owP0CVxw2G5keDM7HPPKuogxVoMsRefTw%2FeAS8XrvK6%2F3TxgUa7T4JKTuTRGiwhcfp6qSviBLY9gACwPSp5aws8NB27bKZHGEhAPSeiOZJaOevsHffhaLb5CMWRSzyloD0cPIdFYPKvP1MGKt06Yqgq2pJQ9LRqPUYJ6i9TxxrfyeYmg2TIetPmTWgykDzv393WBZeup6zWuqH22OqgHKm1cYsBWQGzckGIh77IKSBOBunNie7kWuV1RICSYsaIBw3dSvsGIxe%2FlL8tQz2aWh1JWrznd4qd9gcQDHaCEaOql9hnJmhJoJEaDT9y1OWv5aI0Tkt0%2BVBosZvYpjOwyi7HnXqVGU7kw00nqCzc%2FzU3pEhKfjHhBrJXnxT241q2AggfqygmRtQNrBl0bAkcl%2FW2RPJXI8dtuoLQa0ehIsCFEHgbiTG2kXmE1Yeco%2FFtQe7TatzWrhJpKkb90yTbkHqvR7wd7ABYGRsTABscqOj0rBS419O9Iko2Z%2BJwQU%3D) to again declare their annual conformation statement. They have not done this, and apparently if they do not do so by the 27th November, 'the crown' owns ALWAYS EFFICIENT LLP.


But really, all this could mean nothing. Using offshore companies isn't illegal, I just wanted to hear maybe from some guys here who may have experience with this sort of stuff. An interesting point is that BTC-E [changed their password policy](https://btc-e.com/news/233) on the 2nd October, only a few days after the annual confirmation request was issued.

The machines at my first two train stations were pretty busy and it was stressful trying to figure out what to do for the first time. I ran out of time at both stations, but I tried again at the airport where there were a lot of machines available and I had a lot more time to mess with it. During my train ride I read on the SBB's website how to get through this process, and that helped a lot. 

You have to go through a """"Prepaid/top up Bitcoin"""" option, which wasn't really intuitive for me. Then it asks for your QR code, so I showed it mine, and then you get to this screen!

I had CHF 80 in my pocket, so I chose """"other"""". 
You are shown the exchange rate/fee, which I don't really care about at this point, so I just move quickly through:

Next it asks for your phone number. This takes the most time, especially if you're not used to a Swiss number (put a 0 in front of your number, don't include the +4X or whatever)

https://anonimag.es/image/RIg

It sends you a 4 digit code via SMS, you enter it and continue. Then it asks for your cash, you put the bills in here:

Success! It spits out a receipt where the paper tickets usually come out:

1429,"In case you're interested I've pasted the last dozen comments I made in r/btc below. It goes without saying that for the average r/btc'er these comments are disagreeable, but you can make up your own mind if they're egregious enough to be worthy of having a post cap imposed. Most of the points I've tried to make I've done so by asking questions.

Also, it's worth noting that these 12 comments were made over the course of 5 days. It's hardly like I spend much time over there, but apparently that's how fragile the conversation bubble is.

* Other than pointing out flaws in the current best efforts to develop bitcoin, do you actually contribute any positive solutions yourself? Or, perhaps a more pertinent question would be, do you want to see bitcoin fail?
* You understand that SegWit is the definition of on-chain scaling, right?
* How is that not subsidizing? You're providing a service for free, at a cost to yourself, to encourage usage on your pool. Are these the sound economic fundamentals that small-blockers supposedly lack?
* That's still missing the point.
You could have a batshit crazy, psychopathic maniac who eats kittens for breakfast and they could be the best developer on the planet.
When someone's work is available for review, their beliefs, personality, whatever has zero relevance.
* Are you deliberately missing the point?
* Isaac Newton spent a lot of time working on Alchemy.
My point is, the personal beliefs of anyone mean nothing when their work is open source and there to be reviewed by peers. At the end of the day, the code is all that matters.
* Does the fact that Francis Collins, the scientist who lead the Human Genome Project, is a """"serious Christian"""" take away from the groundbreaking contributions he made to science?
I don't agree with Luke's beliefs, but who gives a shit if he's a competent dev (one of over a hundred working on Core).
* But anyone paying attention to what Roger said in that thread should be able to realise that:
A) he's either confused by semantics himself.
Or...
B) he knows there is no difference between what he and the pro-core miner were saying, and he's using it as an opportunity to get big blockers riled up.
Neither reflect well on him IMO.
* It's an incredibly inefficient way to support large blocks.
An efficient way would be to write code miners are convinced is good for bitcoin. Absent that, it makes sense to pay them off.
As u/egon_1 said, it's a semantics issue. I don't understand why Roger made the post - he's simultaneously arguing against the assertion made by the miner and supporting it.
* Do you think that's a good comparison?
* So the definition of vaporware has changed from just a conceptual proposal to what exactly?
* According to r/btc SegWit was also vaporwear until a few months ago.
Are you going to keep saying the same about Lightning until it's actually in production mode too?

1444,"Bitcoin is a trustless system. The motto is """"Don't trust, verify!"""". In this spirit I wanted to be able to tell how many blocks among last 2016 are signalling Segwit support. So I wrote a simple bash script:

    #!/bin/bash
    YES=0; NO=0
    for i in $(seq $[$(bitcoin-cli getblockcount)-2015] $(bitcoin-cli getblockcount));
    do
        bitcoin-cli getblock $(bitcoin-cli getblockhash $i)| grep '""""version""""' | sed -e 's/^.*: /obase=2;/' -e 's/,$//' | bc | grep  -q '1.$' &amp;&amp; YES=$[$YES+1] || NO=$[$NO+1]
    done
    echo """"Supporting: $YES, opposing: $NO""""

You can run it on your full node to calculate current status.  It takes some time, so be patient. Example output from my node:

    Supporting: 11, opposing: 2005

(As somebody already mentioned, Slushpool started to signal prematurely.)

The script just asks bitcoind how many blocks there are, then asks hash of each block with number from `&lt;count - 2015, count&gt;` (inclusive range) and for each hash it asks for block, to get version. Version is converted to binary and then appropriate bit is grepped and counted.

If you ~~ever~~ see `Supporting: 1916` (or more) **at the end of retarget period**, you know Segwit locked-in. It should even work on older clients, so you can activate manually. :)

Enjoy!

1462,"In my opinion there are certain prerequisites that people need to understand bitcoin.

Im not talking about eventual mainstream users who wont know what they are using, just enjoying the user experience and benifits. Im talking about trying to understand bitcoin in its current form.

1) you need the ability to understand that the paper money we use and take for granted today is the exception to the rule. Out of the last 5000 years its only the last 50 odd years that we have been using fiat currency completely unbacked by gold. This is the biggest comprehension required and the hardest to teach as it requires studying monetary history. Point your friends and family towards episode 1 of hidden secrets of money on youtube.

2) Decentralised networks that cannot be shut down. Having the ability to understand networks that are uncontrolled by any one central point or organisation. Tell your friends the story of how Napster evolved into bittorrent and how bittorrent cannot be shut down because of its decentralised nature. Also explain that bitcoin started off where bittorent currently is, automated decentralised operation.

3) Network effect and how useful networks that are """"good enough"""" can easily grow to dominate due to network effects. Explain how bitcoin has a strong network effect due to its growing user base, growing developer base, growing merchant acceptance, growing bitcoin businesses like exchanges and non-currency use cases utilising the bitcoin blockchain like rootstock and factom and how they all feed back into eachother to create a stronger network effect than even fb ever saw. A good way to understand this concept of network effect is to watch the fb movie 'social network' and see how fb grew from one university to global domination.

All of these concepts should be included in any attempt to explain bitcoin, wether its a documentary, short introductory video or just a casual conversation. It sets the ground to move onto other concepts like how bitcoin actually works IMO.

TLDR;

To truely understand bitcoin, before you try to explain how it works, make sure the audience understands the concepts of unbacked/unlimited fiat currency, decentralised networks, and network effect."

1465,"To everyone who is complaining about the 1MB block size limit, high fees and other issues: Bitcoin is an open source project. In order to start a fork with a larger block size, all you have to do is clone the official repository, tweak a couple of parameters and you're good to go. This isn't a walled-garden variety payment solution like Paypal, where you depend on one central entity to make changes to the project.

Since you claim there is a lot of support for the increase (both political and in terms of hashing power), it shouldn't take very long for said supporters to switch to your chain and leave the current one in the dust. May the best chain win.

I will reiterate the question: what's stopping you? Why do you need a few developers that call themselves """"core"""" to do it for you? Forking right now would be a win-win for everyone: 1MB supporters get to be left alone and stay on the current chain, and you guys get to enjoy your big blocks.

Am I missing something obvious?"

Nevertheless, let me ask:

* 1) Assuming 100% of TXs were of the type standard transaction with 1 TXInput and 2 TXOutputs (one of which is the change), then

 - How many TXs would fit into one 1MB block today.

 - How many TXs would fit into one block with SegWit? And what would be the total block size including the witness data then?

* 2) Same question(s) as """"1)"""", but with 2 TXInputs instead of 1.


Would be great if someone could make the maths."
1468,"If the 40GB chain was compressed, we would save several GB, right? This would be quite a lot of bandwidth saved across thousands of nodes....and that's only taking into account the existing blocks; new blocks could be compressed by miners before sending them out.

This is a trade-off with CPU resources, but isn't bandwidth the biggest constraint right now? People don't want to run nodes at home because there's hundreds of gigs used per month when running a full node. Also most of the decompression time is only a 1-off effort, which is when a node is first downloading the whole chain. After that, decompressing a new block shouldn't take that much CPU time.

What's the downside to this?"
1469,"Recently the ECB (European Central Bank) officially warned about the dangers of bitcoin: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-19/ecb-wants-curb-bitcoin-use-over-fears-it-may-lose-control-over-money-supply

So lets imagine that a central bank wanted to take control of the bitcoin network.. 

Note that the following attack only works if the blocks are not full.

To understand this, we must first focus on the economics in the fee market:

If the blocks are full = the price is set by users:
Miners are simply filling blocks based on the fees that are payed by users.
Users are competing for blockspace, and the price of blockspace is determined by how much the users are willing to pay to send a transaction. 

If blocks are not full = the price is set by miners:
Miners are competing to offer the lowest possible price for blockspace. They try to include as many transactions as possible while at the same time excluding those that pays too little in fees.
The price of blockspace is determined by how little the miners are willing to demand in fees.

So lets say that the block size is increased and that the blocks are no longer full...

As a result “The 5 Step Roadmap To Destruction” becomes possible:

Step 1:
Wait 7.5 years, by then the block reward will have dropped to only 3.125 bitcoin per block. 
At this point the miners have become dependent on fees as their main source of income.

Step 2:
Get control of 10% of the total hash-power in the network.

Step 3:
Start processing all transactions for free. 
This will have a global effect on the fee marked. The price of blockspace will simply collapse. Users are no longer required to pay to get their transactions into a valid block. 
The result is that all miners loose their main source of income.  

Step 4:
Since the attacker is a central bank, they have access to unlimited resources.
The attack is continued until all other miners are bankrupt due to the lack of income from fees.

Step 5:
The central bank becomes the central processing entity of bitcoin. All other miners are now out of business since they are no longer able to collect fees.

Conclusion:
To avoid this attack we must keep the blocks full so that the price of blockspace is set by the users and not by the miners.

Airlines over the past decades have scaled. They added more seats per plane. (scaling). But also airlines have grown in the process. They added more planes. So when the topic comes up about scaling Bitcoin the reality is the only way to scale is to make the tx size smaller. This will allow more tx per mb block. Adding additional mb per block is growing. Most companies in the beginning grow. It's not until growth has peaked do they scale. Bitcoin can grow and scale within a balance. And that is what Segwit allows. Growth of the block and scaling off chain with millions of tx per seconds. Which requires less blockspace to accommodate. Bitcoin Blockchain does not scale very well if at all. Blockspace cost more per MB added. That is the economic argument. "

If they only knew that they could acquire bitcoin with their bank accounts back home (Germany, Australia, and France) and sell those coins for cash locally, in India, their immediate cash shortage problem would be eliminated.

Obviously, there is a missed opportunity for some individuals in India to become Bitcoin traders to help bridge the gap between those who have euro, dollars, or whatever abroad and need rupees locally.  So the trader buys bitcoin from the tourists desperate for INRs at maybe 10% below spot (a fee not much different from any other remittance method), and then that trader can sell the bitcoin on the Indian exchanges at 20% over spot.

That's a potential profit of 30% on the trade.

1476,"1. For SPV wallet, Core has to add some """"trusted endpoint"""" to verify the blockchain. So it will violate the decentration attribution of Bitcoin.

So, I think, it's right to release an SPV wallet and users can add """"trusted endpoints"""" themselves. 


2. It's time-consuming to sync blockchain for 1-2 weeks initially for new users. Very frustrating.
 
3. Nowadays, if people use an SPV wallet, they have to trust the ***only one endpoint***, that is , the SPV provides. Although SPV providers such as greenwallet is very good, it still could be hijacked.

A very interesting ICO, however the valuation you are putting on the website is ludicrous. You are essentially saying the company is worth the amount of profit earned lifetime, ~7000 bitcoin, which is a bit insane. Dean has been talking about adding sports betting and a casino for a couple years now, and each time they've popped up, they've gotten extremely low traffic and/or they did not function properly. Would this change with better software and better marketing? Yes. However, this also means we have to put our trust as investors into a pie in the sky promise that you have contacts in the industry who can drive the company to another level and finally get a foothold in the bitcoin gambling industry. But I have seen no proof, despite past promises, that this is going to happen. We need more than 'I know a lot of contacts'. We need a portfolio, a well thought out business plan, and more info on these supposed experts you know so we can get a more accurate picture for how you are going to turn investor's money into a casino and marketing machine that actually has a chance at significant market share outside of the Dice market.

You need to lay out exactly what this 2000 bitcoin is going towards.

I think an important question is, why would any contacts or software developer you know want to help build you a casino platform that's worth a damn if you they aren't going to have any equity in the business? Why wouldn't they just build it on their own?

Imagine you walked into Shark Tank and you told Mark Cuban 'I want 1.5 million dollars (2000 btc) for you to invest in 30% of my company. I've shown success in this other market, but this new market I've never been in and I don't know yet exactly what we're going to do, but I know a lot of people in the industry, trust me'. You'd be laughed off the show. 

It is also important to note that 1 bitcoin earned 2 years ago is not equal to 1 bitcoin earned today. Back then, the price was about $250, and now its at $750. Even 6 months ago, the price of bitcoin was about 60% of what it is now. A huge chunk of the profit came from those time periods. Bitcoin is at, basically, an all time high. I get the thought process from your perspective, although I think it is misguided. You've tried to sell Betking at least 2 other points in the past year that I can remember, but the problem is almost all of Betking's value stems from the bitcoin community's trust in Dean. The brand and software has very little value in my opinion - that's why no one ever offers anything close to what Dean feels Betking is worth (apparently 7000 btc).

All of this is potentially moot however, because at the end of the day a company is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. I seriously doubt this ICO is going to work, considering from what I read in Dean's previous attempt to sell Betking less than a month ago the top bid was 1500 bitcoin for 100% of the company, unless someone offered more and he did not reveal it publicly. How he gets the idea that his top offer was 1500 bitcoin for 100% of the company and in turn starts this ICO 2 weeks later trying to sell 30% for an even larger bitcoin amount than what the top investor offered him for 100% doesn't really make much sense.

Dean's problem in this situation is the only truly valuable commodity in his business is himself as someone who is trusted. That is worth a lot of money. However, all these attempts to sell the whole, or parts, of the company are going to come up short because Dean obviously disagrees with my assessment of the value of his website/software. Dean should eventually just take Betking private and get all the profits himself. It would provide a steady, healthy income for years. Build a new casino/sports betting platform without the investors. Like you said, you are taking in 50% of the profits for a site you believe is worth 5 million dollars and has basically zero operating cost. 

A massive problem as well is investors are likely never going to get their investment back+profit, because the only scenario where they do is if Dean decides to sell the company in the future. The problem with that is, Dean is the value of this company. If he doesn't come in the package, no one is paying 7000 bitcoin for this site at the current USD/btc value. Sure, you could sell your shares to other interested buyers, but that will be the only market there is for your shares. You will be relying on dividends to make you money, and this does not have a great outlook if you look at the past few months of wagering on Betking.

The past week, there has been ~670 btc wagered on Betking. That is an expected profit of 6.7 btc/week, or $5,000 per week. $260,000 a year. Or, 19 years to make the $5 million dollars the Dean values his website at. 

Also important to look at is how far above EV Betking has been running for Dice. Selling for the actual profit amount is actually quite disingenuous, because Betking could just as easily be at 0 profit as it is at 7000 btc profit. The EV number is the only one that truly matters.

At a much more reasonable ICO price, I would've been very intrigued by investing in Betking/Dean. However, the price is absolutely bonkers.

Regardless, best of luck.

____________________________________

After Dean deleted this post, there was a minor uproar in the thread accusing Dean of using dirty tactics trying to silence some legitimate questions in the form of deleting posts that disagreed with him. Dean decided he would reply to me since he got caught, and he mostly posted vague responses and avoided the most pressing questions. That reply is #127 in his ICO thread.  

Next, we had one final back-and-forth:

Dean:
I'm wondering if people are a little scared to invest due to the no cap and that if we got too much then your share is low.

Maybe we should have the option that if we raise 4000 you can get a refund, 1st come first server, until funds drop to 3000?


Chazley:
The reason people are scared to invest is because you have laid out zero vision on how this is going to work, and because you've put an insanely high valuation on your website.

You may think this is personal Dean but it's really not. I would love to invest in Betking and you if I had the chance, and I did that for a long time as an investor in the site's bankroll. 

However, this seems like it was an extremely rushed decision to offer an ICO. Details are incredibly important in these situations and you've laid out none of them. I think a small group of the site's bankroll investors convinced you this was a good idea, and those members bought in quickly. However, if you want to raise 2000 bitcoin instead of 183 for 30% of your company, you need to fully answer the questions raised in my previous post and many others in this thread. 


Dean:
I laid out the plan in the original post. It's all stuff that has been discussed with the previous bankroll investors for a month or so.
The only part of it that doesn't have a well laid out part is the marketing plan.
That's just something that needs more time and will depend on funds raised and who we work with.
The plan would obviously be totally different if we raised 4000 Bitcoin instead of 2000.

The product and software improvements aren't hard to understand and are obviously things that just generate more income for the site.

I'm still in talks with previous investors via email and in the slack channel who could bring the amount raised up to 1000 before end of first week. 
There's still 4000 Bitcoin sitting in player funds on BetKing. To me that would seem that some people just need more time to make the decision or they would have withdrew by now.


Chazley:
Want to evaluate each of your points one by one, because it is important for investors. 

     """"I laid out the plan in the original post""""

Ok, let's assume you did even though logic says you missed out some vitally important details. I have some followup questions. What exactly is the plan for the 2000 btc? Is this just you cashing in equity in your site while furthering your edge even more, or do you have a step by step plan on what you are going to do with that 1.1 million dollars that will improve the site?

Who exactly are these so-called contacts? Who's money are you paying them with? How much? Why would they develop a casino that has a potential future as the biggest bitcoin casino without having any equity in it? Are you giving them equity?

     """"It's all stuff that has been discussed with the previous bankroll investors for a month or so.""""

Why are only previous investors privy to these details? If you only want them to have the details, why come public with this sale? If you are so confident these bankroll investors are going to invest 1000 btc, why not just sell 15% and only sell to them?

     """"The only part of it that doesn't have a well laid out part is the marketing plan.""""

That is a very worrying sentence if you believe that is honestly true.

     """"That's just something that needs more time and will depend on funds raised and who we work with.""""

This sentence is important. You admit you need more time. I agree. However, when you bring an ICO public and are asking for 1.1 million dollars, you need to have 95% of it figured out and a great plan to follow moving forward. I'd say you have about 10% of it figured out, and if you don't, you are holding back a lot of important info that you shouldn't be if you are bringing this ICO public.

     """"The plan would obviously be totally different if we raised 4000 Bitcoin instead of 2000.""""

Why not lay out a plan for both? It may actually increase incentive to invest. I will say though, expecting more than 2000 bitcoin to be raised for this is incredibly ambitious and, in my mind, completely unrealistic. I wouldn't worry about contingency plans and I would focus on what the 2000 btc plan is and release it publicly.

     """"The product and software improvements aren't hard to understand and are obviously things that just generate more income for the site.""""

I'd disagree that the problem is that they're hard to understand, and would instead say there is no proof there actually are improvements coming besides a blanket promise from you that it is coming... eventually. For any serious investor, that's not enough.

     """"There's still 4000 Bitcoin sitting in player funds on BetKing. To me that would seem that some people just need more time to make the decision or they would have withdrew by now.""""

That's a huge stretch. Maybe, just like me as a fellow investor, they just haven't checked the site yet to realize you divested their money and went to private funding? I personally didn't receive any communication from you that you were closing down, although it's no big deal. 

------------------

I want to start this thread so I can speak freely without Dean deleting posts from not just me, but other people who raise legitimate concerns about how this is going to work. I hope that transparency will help everyone."

1490,So I am looking to use a local bitcoin atm for a purchase. It says on coinatmradar.com that only purchases of 1000+ per day require verification. But when I looked up how to use the genesis1 again [here](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/how-to-buy-bitcoins-with-bitcoin-atm/#genesis1) it says it requires it. Anyone have experience with this machine and can tell me whats the deal?
1491,"I'm typing this from a mobile,  so please excuse any typos.

Though I've been interested in Bitcoin for a couple years now,  and have owned/spent a few mBits in that time,  I haven't been too involved with the community or development. The desire is there, but what is holding me back is the complexity of it all.

I see people all over talk about wanting large scale adoption and use, and I share the sentiment. But when I read about Segwit or Lightning network,  I get concerned for all those who aren't great with computers yet own bitcoin. Even myself,  when I look at my electrum wallet I get a little overwhelmed, and that is something 'laymen' bitcoin users will be interacting with.

My questions are as follows: Is it that bitcoin is still in a fledgling stage where it's not ready for widespread use? If so, what do you think needs to happen before it's ready? Additionally, if they are implemented, are Segwit and lightning network going to be background elements that the common user of bitcoin won't even notice? Finally, if Segwit / lightning network does require the common user to have direct interaction,  how complicated will it be? Will I have to have multiple apps just to send a bit cent to my nephew?

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I want to follow up by saying I am neutral on these subjects, and if I come off as if I am pushing an agenda  please let me know and I will try and edit accordingly."
1492,"This """"reference block"""" would need to be validated, of course. 
This could be achieved in the following way:

**1)** Every N blocks, the miners would build a """"reference block"""" containing the transactions currently in the UTXO pool. This block is not broadcast through the network. Instead, it's built through specific rules (like the order with which the UTXO's were created). This way, the whole network has a common view of the """"reference block"""".

**2)** The *merkle root* of the transactions in the current block would be included in the current block's *coinbase* parameter of the current block. The block is mined and broadcast to the network, as any other block.

**3)** Nodes only propagate that Nth block if the block passes the block validation rules AND the *merkle root* in the coinbase parameter of the block is correct (which makes the consensus rules tighter, not broader, therefore not requiring a hardfork).

**Perks:**

* Smaller blockchain

* Backwards compatibility: It's up to each node to decide if they want to keep the full blockchain or adhere to the """"reference block"""" idea. If a node decides to keep the full blockchain (or just doesn't update at all), that doesn't cause any compatibility problems. The only thing it notices is a weird *coinbase* parameter in the Nth block, which is still perfectly legal.

* IBD would also be faster if the user chose to download blocks only from the last (or second last, or third last...) """"reference block"""" onwards. As long as the Nth block has enough confirmations, it should be safe to trust its contents.

**Questions:**

**1)** Would this have any security consequences?

**2)** Would this affect the consensus rules?

**3)** Would this require a Hardfork for some reason that I'm missing?

1493,"I hadn't used bitcoin in a while and was just getting back into it. I sent a transaction from my Armory wallet to another one, and left the default fee of 0.0001 for the whole transaction. Apparently the transaction size is relatively large (5kb) and as a result the fee is quite low for a transaction that size. 

I then went to transfer more with a higher fee but I think it used the change from the first transaction so now I have 2 stuck transactions (Armory shows it as """"mempool replaceable""""). What are my options for getting these transactions to go through?

1494,"Hey all,

I recently restored my Trezor-secured Mycelium wallet through the Mycelium app using the 24-word master seed I received when setting up my initial myTrezor wallet. I keep all of my Bitcoins on this wallet and mostly just hodl, but cashed out a small amount recently due to running out of cash (I've set up a second wallet in which I keep a bit of change for situations like these now).
My question is, since I typed in the master seed on my android phone (though I disabled my Wi-Fi and Mobile Data connection beforehand), is it still safe to keep this master wallet or should I transfer my current balance to a new Mycelium HD-account, then wipe my Trezor, set up a new master seed account there and transfer the money to my Trezor wallet?

The reason I'm hesitant is that I put my master seed into a Cryptosteel and it takes quite a while to put all the letters in. Just wanted to hear the opinions of this subreddit before I commit to this.


Edit: Alright, the people have spoken. I will set up a new master seed and move my funds there to increase my security. Thanks for your inputs.

1499,"I think one usability issue can be solved by the community (i.e. Not just devs and miners). The issue I'm talking about is the awkwardness of paying 0.0065485blah blah as opposed to 6500 satoshis. The money people are use now breaks the common unit into divisions dollars and cents.  I think it would feel more like money. 

So I propose calling the last 2 0s to the right be called bits and the decimal place be moved 6 places to the right so what is now 1 Bitcoin would be worth 1000000.00 satoshis. If you spent 10000.25 satoshis you'd have 899,000 satoshis and 75 bits. I think something like this is more natural than picobits or 0.00765004btc.

24 years young so I know I have a lot of time. I have no programming experience. I have a B.A. in Math and Econ and have only held simple Analyst positions. Knowing bitcoin and companies that utilize the blockchain are 5-15 years from being fully operational (I've heard ranges of 10-20 years but I think 7-15 is more fair), what can I do right now to get myself in a position that is directly involved with this new tech?

I'm learning Python as a coding base and plan on mastering Javascript and C++. I'm taking a variety of online classes about bitcoin, from Coursera to Youtube. Also trying to learn more of data analysis and machine learning, another passion of mine.  Currently, I've just began to enter the tech industry with a new job I just accepted. 

Any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! I know in the grand scheme of things, I need to find something I like and follow through with it, but as of right now I love bitcoin and the potential both it and its technology could have on our world.

1516,"Hi folks,

I wanted to share my story of how i use bitcoin and why its a big deal. As someone who has to travel frequently, accessing cash abroad is either a hassle (bring cash, find money changer), or I have to pay large amounts of fees to withdraw at the atm. If i use my debit card there to get cash, i pay 5$ overseas fee + shitty exchange rate + 200php (5$) local bank. So with a typical withdrawal of 100 bucks, i pay about 10-15% fees.

Now in the Philippines, you can withdraw cash directly from your bitcoin wallet (coins.ph) to any security ATM (one of the major banks) for free. So when i need cash, i buy btc via coinhako (0.9% fee), transfer it to my coins.ph wallet. Their withdrawal option in the app will give me a code, which i can enter at security bank ATM and get cash without any ATM card. The conversion btc-php comes at a approx 1.25% fee. So overall i am able to get cash overseas for max 2.5%.

A nice plus is also, that at the end of the trip, i can pay my remaining peso back into my btc wallet at any seveneleven.

Now who needs a bank account anymore?"

* India did it by declaring the biggest two bank notes, 500 and 1,000 rupees each, invalid and thereby causing a cash crunch and a sharp recessionary down-spike in its entire economy, not to mention at least 12 deaths due to extremely tiresome waiting in front of banks to offload the old bank notes.
* Venezuela did it by introducing hyperinflation and by generally ruining the country.
* The [OECD](https://www.google.com/search?q=OECD) did it by introducing [AEoI/CRS](https://www.google.com/search?q=OECD+AEoI+OR+AEI+CRS), essentially removing banking secrecy and, among other things, requiring banks and other financial institutions, including bitcoin exchanges, to report each account holder to his or her home taxman. Beginning 2017, the number of participating countries rises to 101. All major bitcoin exchanges are in these countries. So some people thought it wiser to change their money into bitcoin, withdraw these, and close their accounts before the end of the year.

Keep going, governments of this planet. It looks as if you wanted to shovel your own graves."

1542,"As we enter the new year, I am feeling the heavy regret of not buying bitcoins when I first heard of them in 2015. 

So, I intend to buy a bitcoin (singular, big investment for me, but flirting with the chance of favourable returns come March), ahead of the possibility that adoption becomes more widespread, esp. if adoption becomes easier for the common non-geek consumer.

Being a novice, my intuition is not yet developed. I understand ball-gazing to be unreliable, people have been amiss in their projections for when Bitcoin will stablise around the $1,000 mark. However, I wish to gather your opinions on the immediate future. 

What trend do you suppose we'll see on the entrance to 2017? Might it be best to purchase coins now, given a +7.22% increase this week, but -0.9% decrease today? What is the chance that many people are hoarding Bitcoins, with the ambition of cashing short-term gains as the clock ticks over? Will we see the off-loading of coins, or people buying en-masse after seeing how the markets perform come the 1st? Am I over-estimating any potential seismic activity, will 2017 arrive without a ripple forming into a wave?

Tl, dr: What do you suppose we'll see as we enter 2017?

Thank you."

1545,"1mb, three years later, and Btc price have gone up nearly 5 fold, transaction fees for miners are higher than they have ever been.  So what's changed? 

While we were arguing and fighting about how to build a better product, others are buying our product and pushing up the price warts and all. Maybe we just have a superior product, just the way it is, with no one in-charge and no one in control.

Watch this interview with Chandler Gou on the scaling debate. Everyone is happy with the price going up and nobody wants to rock the boat, or move into uncertainty. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lqi9pJ2y64
His suggestion for a compromise 1.2 mb increase will probably not work because it still requires a hard fork, and there are others with control of enough hashing to prevent Segwit activating. https://bitkan.com/news/topic/25778

So where do we go from here ? Bitcoin will scale and I think it will scale from the peripheral. Rootstock, Lightning, Bitcache etc. For these projects to succeed they must win the hearts and minds of the community through adoption. 

There can't be any suspicion of """"building a twisted hand"""" ( Making a system to benefit oneself) as implicated by Mr Jiang against Core. Segwit will probably be adopted as a soft fork but not before peripheral scaling solutions are in place. In the meantime bitcoin price will keep going upwards. This """"train"""" has too much momentum now to be stopped. Like the honey badger it doesn't give a F###. 

And as a sideshow we can all watch Segwit activate on Litecoin."

1547,"There's been heightened awareness lately of the risk of mobile phone numbers being hacked (ported, SIM cloned) which then has been used to get into email accounts (even 2FA'd ones) that have """"phone number"""" as recovery option. See Kraken's great [blog post](http://blog.kraken.com/post/153209105847/security-advisory-mobile-phones) and Coinbase's [post too](https://blog.coinbase.com/on-phone-numbers-and-identity-423db8577e58)

From this there's 2 critical lessons:

1) You 100% have to set 2FA for emails and other important accounts, and it absolutely should not be SMS/text message based. 

2) Don't set phone number as recovery option or even as an account setting for email/important accounts

(you should also take steps with your mobile phone provider to limit their vulnerability of being socially engineered...but dont place too much faith in that!)

This limits the damage of your phone number getting rekt.
 
However, email providers like Google (their [""""Prompt"""" app description here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7026266?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en))/Outlook also offer [a third option for 2FA through """"mobile app""""](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12414/microsoft-account-identity-verification-apps-faq). 

So, NO apparent TOTP code generated to be entered (as on GAUTH and receiving SMS), but just an app that brings up a notification for you to Tap (looks  [like this](http://i.imgur.com/UWEEw3G.png) in Google settings -- NOTE that this is not the same option as SMS/text nor TOTP secret for GAUTH/others!!):

* **Approve a notification. With this kind of app, you no longer need to enter security codes. Instead, you'll receive a notification on your device when you need to verify your identity. Open the notification, approve it, and you're done.**

Is this 

A) Worse than GAUTH / TOTP?

B) Any better than SMS / Text Message 2FA?

**The issue is, if someone hijacks your phone number, can they somehow leverage that to access the """"App 2FA"""" specific to each service like the Google Prompt or Microsoft Sign-in 2-factor options?**"

A month later, they collapsed the website and made an announcement that they had been hacked.

It only took a week before they put the entire database up for sale for a measly BTC which perfectly summarizes the lengths people will go to to misappropriate funds and the judge of characters that make it uncomfortable for those looking from the outside in the crypto microcosm.

1554,"Earlier today I tried sending 1 bitcoin using Electrum's default transaction fee and it took 2.5 hours to send. 

So I wanted to test it to figure out what amount I should be using, so I sent $10 (0.01btc) and set a 0.50USD transaction fee thinking it was pretty high and would make it go through faster. Bitcoinfees.21.co said 0 delay would require at least .0007USD per byte so I multiplied that by 226 and got 16 cents, so I just went with 50 cents to be safe. It took 1 hour. 

My question is: is this a """"good"""" transaction time, or is it slow? It seems kind of slow. If you wanted to move some BTC onto an exchange to sell it, and it takes an hour or more to sweep it into Electrum, then another hour or more to transfer it to the exchange, by that time you could be too late already. So what can you do about this? 

Also, is there a better way to figure out what to set the fee to? Should you set it really high (like to $5) or after a certain point does it not help at all? 

And finally, is Electrum considered a good wallet or no? When I sent a $10 payment with a 50 cent fee from a blockchain.info wallet it went through in 15 minutes. When I sent a $10 payment with a 50 cent fee from Electrum, it took an hour. I know there are other variables at play but I just want to know how to send money fast without having to sit there refreshing the page all day to see if it's done yet. Any advice would be appreciated. "
1555,"Recently we opened a crowdfunding campaign to support the launch of our social study of Bitcoin use. 

The project website for the crowdfunding campaign is: [experiment.com/cryptocurrency](https://experiment.com/cryptocurrency)

For this study we propose to conduct an ethnography of Bitcoin use. We will be studying the diverse social and cultural contexts surrounding the use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In this study we will also look at the mechanisms for trust, security and privacy that are raised through cryptocurrency use and characterise the role of Bitcoin alongside people’s use of other currency forms, digital and non-digital.

Our [recent paper](http://telsoc.org/ajtde/2016-03-v4-n1/a49) outlines our research directions and provides the context for the ethnographic research proposed and you can find a plain language summary of the research at [my blog](https://alexiamaddox.com). 

This research is being conducted because there is currently limited understanding of the use of Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies more generally, across diverse socio-cultural contexts. It is timely because alternative payment systems gain more appeal during periods of economic instability and resulting waves of political backlash from disaffected groups.

Should you be interested in staying connected to the research as it evolves you can follow the researcher on the ground, Dr Alexia Maddox, by [twitter](https://twitter.com/alexiamadd) or receive research updates via [her blog](https://alexiamaddox.com). 

If you are interested in participating in the study and have used Bitcoin, please contact me directly by email alexia.maddox [at] rmit.edu.au

1568,"Hey guys, just wanted to share some excerpts from Charlies new book,""""How Guard Your Coins And Booty Hole"""".

It really takes an """"inside"""" look to proper measures a Bitcoiner will need to take to not be mounted in the gox while in prison. 

1.  Always sleep with your cardboard stock paper wallet in your mouth, and your back to the wall.  In the unfortunate event another person in your bitcoin and prison community is trying to put a member in your mouth,  they will pass given the rough feel.  If your booty hole is tucked against the wall, you are creating a Chinese firewall to prevent the dragons from pillaging your cavern. 

2.  There is no such thing as free bitcoins,  or a free candy bar.   No matter how nice it may seem, the large ogre offering you magical Internet money, or a free Snickers bar, is merely trying to perform wizardry on your brown eye.  Better batten down the cheek hatches, and politely decline. 

3.  Never shower.  A nice hot shower after a long stressful day of doing nothing may appear welcoming, but danger lurks around the corner.  The second you slip off those not-so jesus like sandals off and snuggle up to a shower head, the mythical trouser trout beasts will appear.  They will come in many forms,  and before to long, you will be drowning in a pool of their offspring. 

4.  Always be working on updating your security measures.  As you are now fully aware, there are many potential attack vectors in the Bitcoin prison community.  One large ogre created a DAO and has hoarded all of the Bitcoins and Marlboro's.  Decentralization is at risk.  

Your only option is to build a majestic sword made of the finest Colgate toothbrushes and tape,  and slay the beast.   Luckily, the ogres code was shit and you found a way to drain the funds via a smart contract.  

5.  With all the other ogres basking in your brilliance, you are now free to romp around the fenced in land proudly wearing your White Hat crafted out of toilet paper.  You have successfully survived your first week in prison.  Both your Bitcoins and booty hole still in tact.  

You have gained the respect and trust of the ogre nation in your community.   You go to sleep peacefully. 

6.  Alert Alert.  Bitcoinwisdom alarms going off like crazy.   You wake up to discover there was a massive hack.  The price of your Bitcoins are plummeting, thanks Finex, and your bed sheets are soiled in blood.   The smell of brown sorrow lingers in the air throughout your concrete home.  

7.  The fetal position is your friend.  Despite the urge to sell your hacked Bitcoin tokens and battered butt hole virginity, you hodl.  Like the great Spartan you are.  You curl up in the fetal position and dream about the days when your coins can rest safe in a Trezor, and wars are not being battled over your poop shooter.  Hodl tearful Spartan, hodl. 

The list really could go on.  An amazing book delving deep into the physical and mental struggles of a Bitcoiner in prison.  Well done Charlie!

1591,"Well where do I begin. 

It all started when I reported a potential scammer to support and changed my feedback from positive to negative on a specific sellers account. 

I did some investigating from a Rewards Visa giftcard that was used to pay me for my BTC.

 I was able to get in contact with the owner of the reward visa card and he had itterated that he did not authorize anyone else to use the card. I had suspicion that the gift cards being used to pay me were stolen but had no definitive proof. So I decided to investigate to clear my self of doubts. 


After I talked to the the gentelman and recieved word it was unauthoirized i felt a little betrayed by the seller and i updated my feedbacks to negative. In turn the seller changed his feedbacks of me to negative. 


Shortly after my account was banned.


Knowing that I did nothing wrong and was not going to be stopped from making my other trades I made another account and went about my business since the account they banned didnt have any of my BTC left in it. 

I did a trade for some hyatt giftcards a few weeks after my new account was opened with User Bigbitts. He uploaded a picture of the cards and typed in the code and I asked for the cards to be shipped. He said ok and he would covrr the shipping costs. About 4 days later i asked him for an update with tracking and did not recieve a response. 

I had not left any feedback on this user as of tjat time. 2 days went by with no response still. So i left a neutral feedback and said """"this guy is liar and i will never do business with him again"""". Mind you I had almost .6 BTC in my account.

The next morning I woke up to find that account banned.

I messaged support and they said they jaf proof this was a second account and I needed to resolve the issue with the user from my first account. 


So I decided to bite my tounge and swallow my pride and reached out to the user to resolve. We came to an understanidng and middle ground. The user even then went as far as messaging support to let them know the issue between us was resolved and he gave them my BTC address to send my funds back to me.


They told him """" why should we return scammera money"""" . the support agent then went on to state that I ripped off people on that aaccount yet the feedback tells a different story.


So just be fair warned if you try to prove a user is a scammer you will be called the scammer and have your money stolen. Beware of the paxful team as they will continue to manipulate their users and their system for their own gain and profit.

Everytime I message them with proof of issue resolution they just send me some canned response saying I need to explicitly state what I need. Even though I already have countless times. 


Small claims court seems to be the only viable option now seeming how the paxful team has ignored all legal requests and communications on my behalf.

Nevertheless, the number of bit coin users is increasing.

Anyone who used Cryptocurrency will continue to use Cryptocurrency.
Changing the Cryptocurrency type.

In addition, we do not know the side effects of large block chain size.
Cryptocurrency with a large block-chain size may soon be a disadvantage.

There are already several types of Cryptocurrency.
If you do not like the beat coin, you may want to use something else.
And the advantage of bit coin is probably the advantage of small size.
Why would you use bit coin more than other Cryptocurrency?

We do not have to do anything.
If this is the worst, the number of users will decrease.
Then the minors will try to change first.
But now is the peak season.
We do not have to be in a hurry.
Perhaps there is a chance to show other good Cryptocurrency.

The bit coin remains a bit coin

Another Cryptocurrency will continue to be created.

1599,"Hello everyone


2 days ago I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5palup/so_this_just_happened/) telling everyone how I made a mistake and sent out 0.50 BTC as a fee instead of $0.50, the transaction was confirmed by BTC.com, I pretty much thought I lost that money and I will never get it back.

But some people suggested that I contact the miner and see if they could help me, and so I did.

Fast forward 2 days later I got a response from their customer service and they refunded me the entire 0.50 BTC even though they didn’t have to. [TXID proof](https://btc.com/aa738d80f0bb2a4e63ce2bbe26293a9ba1c5da0afca82b245085097dc148f767)

1606,"Despite my earlier issues with CardCash, Eric Berger was able to help me out to resolve the situation.

What happened was that the transaction took 32 hours to confirm -- way longer than anyone should expect.

Here is Eric's response:

My sincerest apologies,

Customer service must have been miss informed. Let me explain what happened with your order. There was a backlog on the blockchain and your transaction didn't confirm for over 24 hours. Our system is set to cancel orders that do not have at least 1 confirmation after that time period and mark them as possible fraudulent """"dummy"""" transaction. I see that your payment eventually did confirm and we did receive payment.

This has proved to be an edge case and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Let me personally try to resolve this for you. I can do one of 3 things. 
1. I can refund your bitcoin
2. I can create a website credit so you can place another order of your choosing.
3. I can manually place an order for you for $100 of Panera Bread if you would still like the card.

Let me know if any of these options are satisfactory to you.

I recently made a Coinbase wallet and i linked it to LibertyX so i could purchase bitcoin in person with cash since i don't have a bank account not linked to my parents. i first had made a blockchain one but libertyX said my address wasn't a valid one, so i switched to coinbase. 

I need to buy some bitcoin in person with cash because i'm buying something online, and the vendor only takes bitcoin. neither of my parents use btc or know what it is and there's other reasons they shouldn't be involved.

catch 22–i'm only 17. I know you're supposed to be 18 to use coinbase.
what will this mean for me? i don't have anything linked to the wallet other than the libertyX account. 

is there anyway that i won't be able to transfer money to the vendor since i'm under 18? i'm just not sure what this under 18 prohibition will mean for me, if Coinbase will even be aware, or what. I just need to buy one thing, my brain is hurting from trying to wrap around all this. I honestly dont even understand how i will even pay the vendor.

Lots of questions, but hopefully they can be understood. Sorry i'm a n00b. Main concern is Coinbase, and libertyX transferring my btc to them and then me not being able to pay the vendor. Help? "

Litecoin’s F2Pool currently controls around 43% of the network’s hashrate. Batpool and Litecoinpool.org are both already signaling for segwit. Combined, around 60% of the current network’s hashrate share will likely upgrade.

To understand how this is possible you must simply look at the chart from a trading perspective. What I mean by that is we have now - thanks only to them - established a serious range market around 1000USD that will forever be regarded as an area of support or resistance.

This area of consolidation would almost certainly NOT have occurred without their intervention.

If it was all roses and we rose from 700USD up to 5000USD in 4 months with not a single hitch, when there was a big hitch where would be the previous level of consolidation the price would fall to? 700USD. That is not stable growth!

1636,"When discussing on-chain scaling, we frequently hear the criticism that the bitcoin blockchain should not be used to record small transactions like buying a cup of coffee, and scaling on-chain capacity would mean all full nodes will be forced to process and store such trivial transactions for eternity. While there's some merit to this criticism, it is a bit of a red herring. This is not what the debate is about.

People in favor of on-chain scalability don't think you must put your coffee purchase on the block chain. They don't even think we should recommend it. They think that at this stage in bitcoin's development, making it possible to put coffee on the block chain will not hurt bitcoin, but refusing to scale block chain capacity will *kill* bitcoin.

Even if LN happens (and I for sure hope it does, soon), unless costs to open an LN channel are in the 1-2 cent range, new users will not use it for every-day payments. They will not use bitcoin either. They will just go somewhere else.

But if we can get capacity up to keep up with current demand and technological improvements, then LN becomes an attractive proposition to a huge percentage of the population of earth, and that's how Bitcoin goes to the Moon."

1641,"After reading hundreds of articles, I've got a decent understanding of the way bitcoins/blockchains work. Now, I'm starting a pretty large project that at it's very core basically will accept payments from anyone anywhere in the world in any currency with any bank account. The idea is to convert all these local currencies into partial bitcoins and store it in a single wallet (?) and process it further. It's a spin-off off this company that is making profits (https://www.bitwala.io/) but I want no money to do this purely because I find it incredibly amusing and want to make this technology accessible to anyone anywhere with a smartphone and without worrying about wallets/blockchains and all that. So I come here in hope of some answers that can point me in the right direction so I can get started.

1. I understand how that company (bitwala) is operating by buying and selling bitcoins in different countries' exchanges to convert currency, but from a programming point of view where do I begin?

2. I want to abstract the entire working of bitcoins and wallets to the user and as far as a regular user is concerned he would be just making a payment using his regular bank account. Is this possible to accomplish? Say you just pay with your credit card and I take this money in whatever currency it is and process it through an exchange and convert it to bitcoins into my wallet, before converting it again to another currency? Again if so, programmatically speaking where do I begin?

Any help or any information would be really helpful and this is with the idea of me investing another year or two of relentless programming this to create something that I have in mind to make people's lives easier, so any criticism/help is welcome!

This is like a hybrid between a petrol/diesel and electric car, with the hundreds of different currencies circulating about, the greedy middlemen corporates and banks are so keen on ripping people off trying to juggle money between currencies, and as long as currencies still exist, there needs to be a single simple no bullshit no middleman raking profits kind of solution and that's along the lines of what I'm trying to build here.

1644,"Guys PLEASE READ THIS before investing your MONEY at GENESIS MINING

This is simple MATH!! 10 years old child can understand this!
 
In this experiment, I will pay **105 $(0.105974 BTC)** for 700 GH/s

GENESIS MINING will charge you **FEES** (Guys please read the Agreement http://imgur.com/a/CRNdl ):
 
a. 0.150 $ per GH/s upfront = 0.000150313 BTC * 700 GH/s =   **0.1052191 BTC  upfront fee**

b. 0.00028 $ per GH/s a day = 0.000000280824 BTC * 700 GH/s = 0.0001965768 BTC A DAY fee
(**0.071750532 BTC a year**)

Now to calculate the profit is very simple, BTC mined in a year minus you cost/investment and the sum of fees. 

700GH/s will generate ≈ **0.1554 BTC** a year. 

**BTC Profit first year**= 0.1554 earning - (0.1052191 + 0.071750532) fees - 0.105974 cost = - **0.127543632 BTC (-127.79 $)** ROI of negative -27%

You invested 100 $ in GENESIS MINING after a year you LOST 100 $ and you OWE them 27 $. 
Their system is designed to keep you buying more Hash Power in the hope of making a ROI in a distant future. 

More Hash power= more daily fees = less profitable Bitcoin earnings.

In the second year, you wont pay the **Upfront fee**, but if the daily fee stay the same, you wont make any profit form the Bitcoin mined, because of the difficulty increase over time, in the end your daily fees will overcome the Bitcoin mined, the following will happen, and your account will be terminated in 20 days. 

 &gt;  """" if, on any day, Coins generated on one day do not suffice to pay item 2 of the Fee above, the Service Provider may use Coins generated on any day thereafter for such payment.""""

I wont consider this a SCAM because it's written in the Agreement, If you have already invested please stop the bleeding and use you money for better good. 

The conversion rate (1 BTC = 990.811 $) and BTC mining rewards (12.5 BTC) are calculated on 2/13/2017

1649,With Segwit's slow adoption and BU's rise in popularity the more this seems like a fight about off-chain vs on-chain transactions. It seems logical that miners would want to keep tx's on-chain as long as possible especially now with the rise in tx fees.

1651,"I just posted this on r/btc and will post it here as well:

There is a significant possibility that neither Segwit nor BU will activate for a long time.

Given what we all think possible for Bitcoin, that would be sad. And, perhaps naively, I still believe that if we can allow our imaginations to go out 3 or 4 years, both sides actually want the same outcome.

Both claim to be champions of decentralization and a trustless Bitcoin. Both also, I think, make unjustifiable claims to blockade the other. Some people in Core seem to claim that """"code is king"""" and the """"best technical solution"""" is the only solution. BU claims to be heirs to SN and to be a liberation movement (my phrase) from the dictatorial Core.

The best technical solution is not best if it cannot activate. And one group's liberation is the other's enslavement. While I know that there are (some?) in Core who consider non action to be OK, because Bitcoin will continue to grow as a value network, I don't think there is anyone (I could be wrong) who does not want both a value network AND a transactional powerhouse, possibly off chain, in 4 years (yes, I made up that timeframe).

If I am correct, then the main impediment to Bitcoin progress is not technical, but, as others have asserted, political. What, when, and how are relative details that have been promoted to justifications. Both camps need to compare the cost of no progress to the cost of compromise.

1655,GBTC should be tracking bitcoin but it's flatlining. The discount has shrunk. My guess is that early investors who were locked in but can now liquidate are trying to do so but the demand isn't there.  The large holders are sitting a massive shares and could do better if they just had bitcoin. So My guess is that Bitcoin Trust will flatline until the underlying asset value is par with the market price.   Any ETF news is baked in by now. And I also see a minimal bump to bitcoin if COIN is approved.
1656,"It took about 2 weeks for me to download and verify the full blockchain on my 2011 iMac HD (no ssd), but I can proudly say that I'm now running a full node and it feels good.  I highly recommend others to do the same and support the bitcoin network.  If I can do it on my old machine, so can you.  (assuming you have the hd space and bandwidth).

As others have mentioned, changing the dbcache value up to 50% of your available RAM while verifying helps.  You can set it in the preferences (no need to use command line).  And just let it run.  I have seen no drops in internet performance during the dl and sync, but I have a fast connection (70Mb/s) so it's not the bottleneck.

It's a testament to the technology of Bitcoin that I can independently verify 8 years of global financial transactions on a 6 year old PC.

Happy Bitcoining!

EDIT:
According to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Clearing_Up_Misconceptions_About_Full_Nodes#Very_roughly_estimating_the_total_node_count, the estimated number of nodes is around 29,170.  I was looking at https://bitnodes.21.co/, which only counts the listening nodes.

March 15 is also the day the US debt limit will need to be raised for the government to continue operating.  Trump is a shit disturber and I could see it going both ways.  His base will be pissed to see him allow the ceiling to get lifted to make room for unchecked spending once again. Maybe he'll say he inherited his current state and that this is the last time he allows it.  Maybe he'll just shut it down and crash us into a wall and lift the veil on what our economy really is.

1676,I feel like people are skimming over what UASF would mean for bitcoin if it was actually being used right now. Segwit would only have 30% of the hashrate securing it which is not nearly enough to warrant use. UASF will create a fork when bu &gt;1blocks are relayed and segwit blocks are relayed. A fork may need to occur but segwit only has 30% support and bu has 15%(?) this sets dangerous precedent for security in the bitcoin network and needs serious rethinking.

Do these hardware wallet's work on software that can be remotely updated by the manufacturing company? If so, can't they maliciously update that code to control/take/steal your Bitcoin if they ever decided to go criminal or update their user policy to incorporate higher or third party fees for use?

1685,"Just wanted to share my experience. I'm a 27 y/o male born and raised in Silicon Valley. First heard about bitcoin some time in 2012. Really started to learn the basics of it after listening to Andreas on the Joe Rogan podcasts beginning in early 2014. Was fascinated from the moment I learned about it and always planned on buying some at some point. From 2014 to 2016 I would periodically check on """"the current state of affairs"""" WRT the major companies operating in the space. Tried to buy a few times in this period but always backed away due to lack of trust in vendors/complicated buying process/lack of information. Finally made my first purchase via coinbase in 2017. 

Spent the entire week brushing up on the current state of affairs in the space. My overwhelming takeaway is that this thing is still nowhere near ready for mainstream adoption. 1) None of the online exchanges are recognizable names to the lay person. Most people will give up on the idea instead of spending several hours researching trust issues with a bunch of random companies. 2) Piggybacking on the last point - if you do do the research, you realize it's not a good idea to trust anyone but yourself with the private keys. Personal wallets/cold storage present another set of challenges and risks to negotiate. 

TLDR: Buying and storing bitcoin without taking on significant risk is not even close to easy. Also, for something that's championed by tech geeks and internet culture, it's surprisingly difficult to find unbiased, consolidated, current information on best practices and what's out there. An ETF would be a gigantic boon to the space. "

My fear is chargebacks.  Has anyone had any issues?  Even with sellers who have a ton of feedback it still makes me a little nervous that I will somehow get fucked over.

1694,"We have to react before it's too late.  
If atleast 50÷ of the nodes rejects all the BU blocks, the major pools like Ant will be forced to stop signaling it, or waste hashing power (= money). If we succeed, the longest chain will remain the one without any BU blocks.  
If we dont do it now, if we wait for more than 50÷ of the miners switching to BU, we will lost and leave definitivly the  power to the mining industry.

So if UASF requires &gt;50% of hash power to support it, then that's just a normal soft fork.  A group of &gt;50% of miners could activate segwit today if they wanted, without needing any """"UASF"""" changes to users nodes.

1701,"Today, I was discussing BU with somebody who claims to be one of the main persons originally behind Bitcoin Unlimited and also claims to be part of a specific group of early adopters including Roger Ver and Olivier Janssens. This person is followed by all of them, including Jihan WU on twitter and is often participating in the """"debate"""" so I'm inclined to believe him.

Although most of his first arguments are just different variants of critiques against Core, I tried to get the bottom of it and I'm pretty sure I found it.

After hours of discussion, his main argument was that was that we need to scale bitcoin to """"billions"""". So when I pointed out that to do that we need both increase in blocksize + onchain optimization AND layer2 scaling via smartcontracts (Such as lightning and others), he finally conceded that their group is just paying lipservice to offchain but that they think that (without being able to explain why) smartcontracts were diminishing the value of Bitcoin as money. This seems to coincide well with the fact that Roger Ver describes fixing malleability as a """"non-urgent"""" problem. They see both fixing malleability and the new weighting of transactions in segwit as enabling of smartcontracts vs the simple use of Bitcoin as """"dumb digital money"""" that according to them would make it more valuable.

So there you have it: Bitcoin Unlimited exists to block segwit. So If you find yourself not wanting to choose """"camps"""", don't expect any compromise such as BU+Segwit from Bitcoin Unlimited side. That's the only reason for Bitcoin Unlimited existence in the first place. And If you want to support Bitcoin Unlimited, remember that there will be no malleability fix, no enhanced smart contracts, no enhanced fungibility. That's the price to pay for the mining pools to support bigger blocks via BU.

It seems that these pools might be afraid of competition of layer 2 smartcontracts such as lightning AND they also fear segwit will enable privacy enhancements as explained by Huang shiliang on 8btc a few months ago. As you can see here:

- http://news.8btc.com/bitcoin-community-is-withering-it-has-lost-the-excellent-circle 
- http://news.8btc.com/be-firmly-and-openly-against-segewit-and-lightning

UPDATE 04/06/17

Add 'uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148' into your bitcoin.conf if you want to signal UASF. 

UPDATE 03/13/17

ADDED a tl;dr; Version at the end of this Post.


UPDATE 03/12/17: 

Just to test it - I reinstalled all on 8GB SD and it works as well. But maybe you should use at least 16GB for the beginning. 

Using a 128GB card for the first version was a little bit stupid - so I reinstalled everything on a 8GB SD card.
Including Linux and a pruned blockchain - and it works.  

I used prune=550 and Jessie Lite (headless / command line) - without wallet and gui.  

The SD is almost full, but it works so far

I also updated the whole manual a bit to make things more clear. Thank you for all your feedback!


-------------------------



Just started my Bitcoin Node today and wanted to share the way I did it with people who are interested in running their own full node. It took some time to write everything down - hopefully correct so far. 

I am sure, many people around r/bitcoin are way more informed and educated as I am - I am the noob. So I wrote this manual to help users like me - noobs, to get started with a cheap, simple bitcoin node on raspberry pi. 

Have fun!


I wanted to get my Raspberry Pi 3 working as a node to support the network. Actually the process of installing and running the node was more or less easy - but for Noobs (like I am) it might be a bit tricky to start the whole thing, because there are different ways.



*Did you - like me - think you would need +120GB on the raspi, external USB HDD  to be a full node? You won't!*



If you have a Raspberry and you know what Bitcoin is, I guess, you are a little bit aware of linux, networks and of course bitcoin - so I won't go into detail too much.

 
This guide is just a little helper to get a full node running on your raspberry pi. Thanks to the help of the nice people in this sub and of course the documentation by the developers, I got it working - and of course also special thanks to raspnode.com - as I followed their tutorial to start - I went some other ways here and there - so please read carefully. 

For the Part 2 I would suggest to have http://raspnode.com/diyBitcoin.html open and read through my manual.


I split the tutorial in 2 Parts - PART ONE is about installing the client on your PC and downloading the Blockchain. 

PART TWO is about the setup of the raspberryPi and transferring the pruned blockchain to the pi and run it as a full node!


The first thing to be aware of is: You actually need to download the whole blockchain to get this working - if you already have your bitcoin client synced on the PC / MAC --&gt; great you can reuse it!



Now you might think --&gt; *""""but you said less than 16GB in the title!""""*


Yes, but the good thing is you won't need to download it on your Raspberry, neither you need to sync it completely on your raspberry which took ages (weeks!) before.
When you finished this Guide, you will just have a max. 4GB Blockchain on your Raspberry Pi - but it still is a full node! The magic word is Pruning. 

~~Maybe~~ even a 8GB SD Card works just fine including Linux (jessie lite)!


So, if you already have a full node on your PC - Great you can almost skip PART ONE - BUT have at how to Prune in PART ONE if you don't know about it.

For PART TWO you'll need a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 (I used 3)
min. 8GB (works also) or better 16GB SD Card. (I used a 128GB for the first version of this manual - which is way too big)


-------------------------
-------------------------
*PART ONE* 
-------------------------
-------------------------

This is the manual how to get started on you PC / MAC / Linux (I did it on Win7)

Go to: https://bitcoin.org/en/download and download the core Client for your Machine (I used win64). 


Install it and configure it to save the Blockchaindata to the directory of your choice - so instead getting 120GB on your C drive, I would suggest to download it to another place like a USB drive. 


You can set this up during the install. 
Standard folder for the blockchain folder is """"%APPDATA%\Bitcoin"""" on Windows.


or you can do it after the install by creating a bitcoin.conf file inside your installation folder / or %APPDATA%\Bitcoin and add
&gt;datadir=l:\yourfolder

to the file. Line by line. 

By the way here you could also just add dbcache - to use more memory to speed up the process a bit:
&gt;dbcache=4096

 
if you don't want to use the settings inside the program.
(you can also set this inside the program under settings! If you have this inside the bitcoin.conf you will see the amount you set there from inside the program - it overrides the values)

You can check inside the windows client under settings, if you can see a manual dbcache is set by having a look at the left footer area. When your dbcache value shows up, everything is fine.


So the Blockchain download process will take time - maybe a few days! 
Depending on your machine, internet connection and HDD.

 
The Blockchain is huge as it contains every single transaction of the past until today.
You won't need to keep your PC running all the time, you can turn it off and on and it will resync automatically when you start bitcoin-qt.exe!


Make sure to close the client always via """"quit"""" - ctrl+q.


After you have your bitcoin core installed, the blockchain downloaded and synced - you are ready to PRUNE!


First - close the Client and let it close smoothly. 
After it is really closed you can follow these steps: 


&gt;By pruning, your blockchain will dramatically shrink. From 120GB to just a few GB. 


Be aware, that you will lose your Downloaded Blockchain as pruning will erase a big chunk of it! If you have enough space, you could of course keep the full blockchain saved somewhere on another HDD.


You can prune by editing your bitcoin.conf file by adding:


&gt;prune=550


I used prune=1024 - not sure where the differences are right now (min. prune=550).
(for my 8GB version I used 550! I suggest to use this.)


Save the bitcoind.conf file and restart your windows client.

It will now clean up the Blockchain. So just the latest blocks are saved.
The client should start without any problems. Maybe it takes some time to prune the blockchain data.

Check if everything works normally (the client opens as usual, you can see an empty wallet) than close the client. 


Inside the Bitcoin Folder, you'll find two folders called: 
&gt;blocks 
&gt;chainstate


those are the interesting folders containing the important data (now pruned) - and we will transfer those two to the raspberry later!

Now you are good to start the raspi transfer explained in the next part.


-------------------------
-------------------------
*PART 2*
-------------------------
-------------------------


Here is what I did:


1) I installed Raspian Pixel (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
using a 128 GB SD - which is not needed because of """"Pruning"""" - I think a 16GB card might work, too!
(You can also install Raspian Jessie Lite - which saves you even more space, as it runs headless - only command line)
(Updated: It is better to use Jessie Lite to save a lot of space - when you are fine with only command line)


2) I followed partly this tutorial to get everything running and setup:
&gt;http://raspnode.com/diyBitcoin.html

Please have a look at it - I have copied the Headlines in capitals to let you know what I did, and what I skipped. 

On Tutorial Page:
Start with RASPBIAN (OPTIONAL) CONFIG OPTIONS.

Set You RasPi up including """"EDITING FILES"""" to save your Layout at the tutorial page and come back here.

I skipped the CONFIGURE USB AND SET AUTOMOUNT process, as we are going to use PRUNING to reduce the 120GB to a tiny filesize - so USB Devices are not needed here!

It was necessary to ENLARGE SWAP FILE to install bitcoin core - otherwise it didn't went through which ended in a frozen raspi.

So have a close look by following the raspnode tutorial at: ENLARGE SWAP FILE.

I have my raspi running via cable to router - but you can also WiFi setup everything
described under NETWORKING ON THE RASPBERRY PI.

Now comes the interesting part:
Follow the steps at DOWNLOADING BITCOIN CORE DEPENDENCIES - they work fine for 0.14.0 too.
Git should be on Board already when you installed Pixel - otherwise you would need to install it. 

&gt;sudo apt-get install git -y
(only jessy lite)
 
I skipped the next command lines - as I don't use bitcoin-qt wallet. If you want to use it as wallet - do the step. 

&gt;mkdir ~/bin
&gt;cd ~bin

Now you are in the folder you want your bitcoin core data be downloaded to via git. 
I didn't Downloaded the Berkeley Database source code - so I also *skipped* the whole next command lines

*pi@raspnode~/bin$ wget http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz
pi@raspnode~/bin$ tar -xzvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz
pi@raspnode~/bin$ cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/
pi@raspnode~/bin/db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix$ ../dist/configure --enable-cxx
pi@raspnode~/bin/db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix$ make -j4*

and went on with  """"INSTALLING BITCOIN""""!

I followed the first part but instead downloading 0.13 I took of course the latest version:0.14 

&gt;git clone -b 0.14 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
&gt;cd bitcoin
&gt;./autogen.sh


this might take some time to start.

--------------------
If you have trouble with hanging RESOLVING DELTAS - just restart the Raspberry Pi and remove the bitcoin folder inside /~bin using


&gt;rm -rf bitcoin


this command will delete the folder and you can reuse

&gt;git clone -b 0.14 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git



For some reason RESOLVING DELTAS is a common problem with different downloads - so just retry it and at least after 3 times it should work!
-------------------


as I didn't use the GUI/ Wallet, I ran 

&gt;./configure --enable-upnp-default --disable-wallet

as I don't need the wallet functionality. 


I didn't need to use """"MAKE"""" which saves you maybe up to 2.5 hours.

instead you can just go ahead with:

&gt;sudo make install

(If I am wrong in doing so - please let me know)

The install takes some time - and just a heads up: when it gets stuck somewhere - just redo the installation process - it took three times to went through - stuck at some processing.

After the installation took place you can finally get your Raspberry Pi Node running in no time!

To test if the the installation went through - you can just start bitcoind using:

&gt;bitcoind &amp;

than check if everything is working so far: 

&gt;bitcoin-cli getinfo

after a few seconds you should see version: etc...

if not, something went wrong. Try to redo the steps in the raspnode tutorial.

(don't give up if it failed - retry! Ask your questions here)

IMPORTANT: you need to stop bitcoin on your raspberry now!


&gt;bitcoin-cli stop 

If you don't need an external USB Drive - what I hope - as we are going to use pruning just go ahead and skip the USB part and create a file inside (or follow the raspnode tutorial on how to setup the USB drive):


&gt;cd .bitcoin

&gt;sudo nano bitcoin.conf

and enter the exact same pruning size you have used on your Desktop Machine to prune.
I used 1024 but the minimum is 550.
(*used 550 for the 8GB SD card on PC and Raspberry*)

&gt;prune=550

That's it for the raspi. 

update: To signal UASF enter in a new line:

&gt;uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148

-----------------
-----------------
*TRANSFER*
-----------------
-----------------


Now you have to transfer the two folders CHAINSTATE and BLOCKS from your PC bitcoind directory to your raspberry.


I am using a program called """"WINSCP"""" - it is free and easy to use:
https://winscp.net/eng/download.php

We need this to transfer the files to the Raspberry pi. Pretty sure you can also do it via SSH  - but I am the noob. So let's keep it simple. 

Open Winscp and put in the IP Address of your Raspberry Pi, User and Password (same as in SSH)


You should now see the directories on your Raspberry Pi. 
There is a folder called

&gt;.bitcoin

enter it and you will see the two folders 

&gt;blocks &amp; chainstate

you can delete them on the raspberry as they have some data from your previous test inside.


Make sure you can also see the bitcoin.conf file in that directory, which needs to contain the exact same prune line, like the one on your desktop machine. If not, make sure to edit it via SSH. The line 
""""datadir=l:\yourfolder"""" is obviously not needed in the Raspberry bitcoin.conf file.
 
Now grab the two folders CHAINSTATE and BLOCKS from your PC and copy them to your .bitcoind folder.


~~I also copied banlist.dat, fee_estimation.dat, mempool.dat and peers.dat to the folder - not really knowing if needed!~~ Not needed.


The whole copy process might take some minutes (against some weeks in the old way).


After copying is finished, you can now start bitcoind on the Raspberry.

&gt;bitcoind &amp;


the &amp; symbol let you still use the command line while the process is running btw. 


The process - if succesfull - will take some time to finish.

&gt;bitcoin-cli getinfo

Will give you some informations what is going on right now. 
When you can see, that it is checking the blocks, this is good! 


If you get an error - double check - if you have the correct prune size (same as on desktop machine) - in bitcoin.conf and that this file is inside .bitcoin on RaspberryPi.
It took me some time, to find my mistakes.


Congrats! You are almost a part of the network!

-------------------


To make your node now a fullnode, you will need to go to your router (often 192.168.1.1) and enable portforwarding for your raspberry pi - and open ports 8333 - that's it!


You can now go to: 
https://bitnodes.21.co/nodes/


scroll down to """"JOIN THE NETWORK""""
and check check if your node IP is connected!

It will show up as soon as the blocks are checked and the raspi is running. 

Well done!


Now you are running a full node, with a small Blockchain and got it working in Minutes, not weeks!


I really hope, my little tutorial worked for you and your are part of the Node network now. 


If you have problems or I made a mistake in this helper tut, just let me know and I will try to make it better.


Have fun and *NODL*!



the noob

------------
tl;dr; (if you are a real noob start with the non-tl;dr version!)

tl;dr;  PART ONE

1) Download &amp; install / setup bitcoincore @ https://bitcoin.org/de/download

2) change dbcache to something smaller than your memory and download the whole Blockchain (120GB).

3) create a file called bitcoin.conf put the line prune=550 (or higher) in to activate pruning on win inside %appData%/bitcoin

4) Open ports 8333 on your Router to make this a full node with a smaller Blockchain. 

You are running a full node on your PC.


tl;dr;  PART TWO

1) Install jessie lite and the needed dependencies on your SDCard - Raspberry 

( &gt;git clone -b 0.14 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git )

- see tutorial for more info.

2) create a file called bitcoin.conf inside .bitcoin and add the same prune=Number you had on your PC.

3) transfer the pruned folders BLOCKS and CHAINSTATE to the Raspberry Folder .bitcoin

4)Start """"bitcoind &amp;""""

5) let everything sync

6) Make sure you have port 8333 opened on your router.

You are running a full node on your Raspberry with a super small Blockchain (I put all on a 8GB SDcard)

The leading minds in the cryptosphere want bitcoin core segwit.

BU has a minority of user support (20%), and ~ 30% from miners who rightfully feel insulted from cores social fumbling.

The way out I think is to convince the miners that core will be more profitable for them. And it will, a united bitcoin will hit 10k+ in the next 5 years. The block reward will be 10 times greater. Even if we limit the blocksize at 1.7mb (segwit). Though we will probably get extension blocks in the future as well. "
1723,"I've been following Bitcoin for a for a long time. Bitcoin was always THE Bitcoin and anything that diverged from it was an alt coin, no way around that.

This crowd parroting talking points about how transaction cost is too high, takes too long to auth, block size, cost of mining etc, either seem to be shills trying to co-opt bitcoin's name for what would, in days of yonder, be called 'the latest CoolKidCoin' knockoff boasting some great feature that the original 'lacks', or I'm missing something here.

I'm not asking to be convinced why we need any of these bullcrap options. What I'm saying is Bitcoin is the core code, no matter how flawed it is. if it morphs into something completely different than what it started, without altering the original protocol, so fucking be it. I won't jump ship because your B1tcoin or Bitc0in clone is better or faster or w/e the heck you keep regurgitating. I load the Bitcoin frontpage and all the top posts are talking about this crap.

Why is this subreddit allowing a hijacking like this?"
1724,"Transaction fees: So far, I think I understand this. Transaction costs will continue to go up past it's current norm of 54 cents, unless there is a consensus among the majority that they don't try to accept higher fees from people who want to move on to the next block faster (want confirmations faster). Will this be remedied in your opinion and when do you think? 

I realise this is a sensitive topic and there's been a political-like cloud on the forum lately, but I'm just asking for facts, I'm not saying anything bad about Bitcoin. I like it, I have some, and I believe in it.

Also: How likely is it that the hard-fork thing will happen and cause problems? I have heard if it happens you will get 2 coins for every 1 you have, like just 1 of each block that branches off. How would this look in reality. So I go to bitpay and send a coin, does it go to which block?

Thank you!"

1727,"There has been a lot of criticism that this subreddit is being censored and this perceived censorship has undoubtly contributed to the community issues we currently have.

First let me state that my position on this is that it's not censorship, but moderation.

People visiting this sub are agreeing to it's (and reddit's) terms of use wich include a rule against 'promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus' alongside numerous other uncontroversial rules, such as bitcoin begging, using referral links, url shorteners, etc. Most people keep visiting this subreddit because of those rules and the work the moderators do (and may not even realize it).

The key difference to censorship is the fact that people, who do not agree with the rules, can open up another subreddit with their own rules. Censorship usually applies across media, which is not the case here. If people were silenced on every subreddit, social media platform, tv, radio and were barred from releasing a book or any content at all on the topic, then it would indeed be censorship.

However, just calling it moderation instead of censorship doesn't make it feel any better when your posts are removed and you have no recourse. But it's still very different from actual censorship.

---

**I propose to make the rule regarding incompatible clients opt-in.**

1. Explicitly tag posts that would otherwise have been removed because of that rule as incompatible, contentious, NSFB (not safe for bitcoin), or something along those lines: http://i.imgur.com/ploDZFv.png
2. Implement /r/worldnews style filtering where you can press a button on the side bar called """"Filter incompatible"""" that would remove any tagged posts and result in the exact same content we have on /r/bitcoin right now.
3. Remove rule violating comments as before, except in threads that are explicitly tagged as incompatible.

Opinions?"
1728,"I keep reading Reddit postings and journalistic articles, debating SegWit vs. Bitcoin Unlimited, trying to illuminate various advantages and disadvantages, but they always miss one very important point:

Blockchain transactions are slow. Even with the highest fee you may have to wait for an hour or, if you are particularly unlucky, two hours, due to the unpredictable times between blocks.

For this simple and non-controversial reason we need quick second-layer payment systems that can perform a confirmed payment within seconds. The Lightning Network is one of them, and there are others being worked on.

SegWit is more or less a prerequisite for them, while Bitcoin Unlimited does not solve the slowness problem at all.

I urge particularly the professional journalists not to keep overlooking such a simple fact.

Some more background information:

Zero-confirmation transactions on the bitcoin blockchain have been proposed, but there is no reliable implementation. As far as I can see, they do not solve this problem. They do not work as well as some people had hoped.

There are other reasons to doubt the viability of BU, but they are far more difficult to understand. If you don't know much of economy and game theory, if you have never understood or even heard of the Byzantine generals problem, unfortunately you don't have the faintest chance of understanding why BU's """"emergent consensus"""" idea is highly problematic. But let's forget these difficult things for now and concentrate on the simple and obvious."

1730,"I'm a web developer and have some insight into how bitcoins work. I care for bitcoin as a technology and is also a hodler. I think proponents of both sides have valid points but have a really hard time determining what arguments are valid. Proponents on both sides have clearly behaved badly, but I don't really care about that. Bitcoin &gt; Individuals and gossip to me.

People in this sub and others discussion bitcoin seem very certain in their opinions. This is boggling to me. Are you? What made you so certain?"
1731,"This is what I understand...

Bitcoin Classic (core) have a transactions volume. Too much transactions to fit in a 1MB block.

To solve this problem, there was an option to increase block size but that need a hardfork? If everyone upgrade to 0.15 (I know it does not exist yet) that would make the hardfork successfull? Right ? 

If I understand correctly a hardwork. The problem would be if some miners don't upgrade and stay at 0.14 there blockchain would eventually split in 2?

Now with 0.14 there is Segwit ? I upgraded my full node to 0.14 yesterday to show my support for segwit. WTH is segwit ? Why people are talking about a user activated fork? How this would happen ?

Now there is BU... Is there a chance the blockchain split like right now ? If a BU miners confirm a block would this split the BTC blockchain ?

It took me almost a year to understand the basic concept of bitcoin...and right now I am so lost.

I can't figure it out by myself even if I read about it every day.

If you can explain like i'm five it would be great and usefull for a bunch of people.

My english is not good so please don't roast me about it.

Thank you."
1732,"What will happen when there is a widespread adoption of Bitcoin,  and users submit millions of transactions per day?  Will current implementation be able to accommodate such volume without huge bottlenecks and leaving countless transactions unconfirmed?"
1733,"I'm curious if the Core devs have a contingency plan in case an emergency hard-fork is required.

There's clearly [many wanted features](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist) that are only implementable as a hard-fork.  If there is some catastrophic event that requires a hard-fork to fix, then not implementing some of these features would be a huge missed opportunity.  Unfortunately, this opportunity seems to have been missed during the block 252451 hard-fork (August 16, 2013).  If you're going to break backwards compatibility, then you might as well get as much out of it as you can.

If there is not already a plan in place, then I would propose creating a git branch dedicated to hard-fork-only features so that an implementation is ready in case a hard-fork """"opportunity"""" arises.  This branch could remain dormant until a hard-fork is required, but it should still be rebased regularly.  When a hard-fork is required, the necessary change will be added to this branch and the branch will be merged into master.

""""In case of emergency, merge branch."""""
1734,"This is an option that I don't think many have considered.

Small blockers/segwit/devs don't want a block size increase because they are worried about decentralization.  And big blockers want onchain scaling PAST what segwit provides.

A Proof of Work change is often brought out as a nuclear option to punish the miners, and force segwit.  But I think this is the wrong way of thinking about it.

This is because this is not segwit/small blockers vs miners.  There really is a large economic minority of users and actors that want a bit more onchain scaling than what segwit provides.

Thus, a hardfork nuclear compromise option, of doing segwit, 2MB HF, AND a proof of work change would be a very good way of getting the support this minority group of real users who just want more capacity AND it would help significantly with centralization concerns.

A proof of work change shouldn't be thought of as political """"punish the miners"""".  It is an option that we can use to solve the TECHNICAL centralization issues that the 2MB hardfork causes.  It is a technical solution to the technical problems of big blocks."
1735,"Let's imagine the worst case scenario of a fork, so that we can prepare ahead of time.  The main hardware wallets that I know of are KeepKey, Ledger and Trezor.  How will these wallets handle the hard fork?  Will they split the bitcoins and we get both, or have they announced yet?

I ask because we may be forced to move bitcoins to an exchange, get the split, then move back - which is more work for us.  If this is the case, I really don't know if I want to continue as it's starting to become more work to be in bitcoin."
1736,"Stonewalling development is not the way. The tides of change are always moving. WITH OR WITHOUT YOU. You cannot stop change of the source code anymore than you can stop a tidal wave. Resign yourselves and let it happen. The Bitcoin core devs who are refusing to change the code for something as simple as a block size update are costing people billions and are essentially putting their own egos above the needs of enthusiasts worldwide. As it has been said time and time again """"everything is vanity"""". This comment is in vain. The government is happily positioning itself on all major media outlets (you never see things on the """"media"""" by coincidence). Bitcoin isn't a coincidence. Nothing is. They have thus positioned themselves to control the majority of coins in existence by hacks and of course creating the currency at its inception.

Congratulations, you get what you pay for.

The illusion of freedom in Bitcoin when the true hope is in *decentralization* not Bitcoin. When will people see that the core devs don't matter. The blocksize debate doesn't matter. The miners don't matter. These are the exact same bad actors that the technology has the POTENTIAL to eliminate. They can of course """"do the right thing"""" and increase the blocksize as a temporary patch so we can all buy time to wait for peer to peer options (like lightning). A split will simply result in the ultimate bull trap. Ruining what was almost 10 years of progress due to infighting.

The world is watching core devs. And they are watching that price ticker, not you. It's not about you. The government created Bitcoin, not the self appointed people who control github... the core devs are nothing. So just push the block size update out and move on please. We all have more important matters to attend to.

     ˈkämyəˌnizəm/
     noun
     noun: communism; noun: Communism; plural noun: Communisms

&gt;a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.

Communism is the idea that that the people might rise up in revolt against their rulers and distribute the otherwise concentrated wealth (bounty) among themselves. It’s not hard to see how such an idea would spread among an impoverished class of (uneducated) people or how such an idea could easily spread beyond national borders (although on the other hand it probably wouldn’t be very well received by patriotic nations).

Marx’s view was that capitalism was the great evil that stole the ability to own the means of production from the common person. The only cure was for the people (the proletariat) to rise up and usurp the rulers (the bourgeois). The intermediate step, known as the “dictatorship of the proletariat”, was the “temporary” de facto government that would lead the people to the new found socialist freedom:

&gt;In between capitalism and communism there is the dictatorship of the proletariat, a democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of universal suffrage;[30]

&gt;Dictatorship of the proletariat-In Marxist sociopolitical thought, the dictatorship of the proletariat refers to a state in which the proletariat, or the working class, has control of political power.

Lenin defines dictatorship from his Marxist view:

&gt;….Dictatorship does not necessarily mean the abolition of democracy for the class that exercises the dictatorship over other classes; but it does mean the abolition of democracy (or very material restriction, which is also a form of abolition) for the class over which, or against which, the dictatorship is exercised.
     — Vladimir Lenin[20][21] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat

But the idea that such a de facto and temporary government might properly serve the people has been oft criticized. Here a quote by John Nash spoils our conclusion, but without the context that will be given later, following the logical argument for such reasoning as to the absurdity of Marxism as a means to a rational ends:

&gt;…in the end the “dictatorship of the proletariat” seemed to become rather exposed as simply the dictatorship of the regime.

1740,"Proof of stake would align mining interest with holder/user interest. 

A simplistic POS algorithm would, every ten minutes, issue the block reward and mining fees to the address that published a block containing all the elements of a current block with the sole change of instead of its hash being below a target score, its hash is the lowest of those submitted by competing stakers and every staker gets one submission per Bitcoin staked with his nonces being his address where the coins are concatenated with a number from one to his number of staked coins.  Nodes relay the lowest blockhash they received they have received and accept lower blockhashes as valid.  There is a period of time, say up to two minutes, where blockhashes only are given time to propagate to consensus as to all those submitted for that block.  Thereafter no new submissions are considered valid. There is no double spending because everyone agrees on which block is valid after the two minute waiting provision.  

I just came up with this on the fly so would be wide open to hearing why this or some better variant cannot be made to work. 

Basically, one blockhash per Bitcoin staked; lowest blockhash gets the reward and fees and submits the block."

1742,"Has anyone proposed using """"parallel chains"""" for scaling bitcoin? After seeing the marketcap spill over to altcoins when bitcoin hits the transaction limit, it made me think. Why not just create N forks of bitcoin (such that each user gets coins on each chain) as a scaling option.

Coins can be transferred within a chain (intra-chain transactions) or between chains (inter-chain transactions). Inter-chain transactions add frangibility to the chains to prevent floating marketcaps. When users transfer coins from one chain to another, the total coins decrease on one chain while they increases on the other chain. Since coins can be transferred between chains, it might be possible for one chain to end up with lots of coins and lots of transactions. Fees and double spend risk should help encourage coins to jump to a different chain and balance out to an equilibrium. There might also be limits set in the protocol to encourage a balance. For example, if the coins in a chain reach a certain threshold, the chain will only accept intra-chain transactions as valid. To prevent an imbalance attack, transactions that exceed this threshold could be required to be inter-chain. The mining reward for all chains would be divided by N.

Would this have decreased security? Would this be a good solution for users that already only care about SPV level security? It might be a good tradeoff."

1756,"This was the topic of a [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2henoi/price_elasticity_of_bitcoin/) in 2014, which got 1 (one) comment.

Price elasticity [means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand) how much demand will be reduced if price goes up.

That's an important point now. Some people think that Bitcoin fees need to be low or zero, or users will switch to something else, and Bitcoin will be doomed.

The question if that is right depends on the question if and how much demand is elastic.

Right now empiric data doesn't point to high elasticity. Fees are way up, but there are still enough users to keep block size fluctuating around 850k.

My best estimate for average transaction size is somewhat more than $1,000. Bitcoin is moving around $300 million a day, with around 260,000 transactions.

For an $1,000 transaction, obviously saving a couple of dimes in fees is not a strong consideration. So it makes sense to expect low elasticity at the present level (average fee of less than $1).

So the answer would be: Yes, some users will be priced out of Bitcoin without larger blocks. But right now, there are enough users left to keep the seats in the airplane full. No urgent need to admit twice the number of people (without particularly caring if that will cause the plane to crash in mid-flight) to save $0.37 on fees.

Bitcoin fees need to get higher to deliver empirical data on exactly when demand drops because of prices.

When and if that happens, smaller demand means that fees go down immediately over market rules. No need to push for a Bitcoin fork in that situation either."

1762,"Bitcoin may be understood as an Internet protocol. If so, it may be of interest to look at the procedure that was followed for adopting other Internet protocols as a model for responsible governance.

Doing this, I found [RFC 1087](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1087), titled """"Ethics and the Internet"""" and published in 1989.

That RFC stated that several activities are unacceptable. One of them was any activity that """"disrupts the intended use of the Internet"""".

It closes with this paragraph:

&gt;The IAB plans to take whatever actions it can, in concert with Federal agencies and other interested parties, to identify and to set up technical and procedural mechanisms to make the Internet more resistant to disruption.  Such security, however, may be extremely expensive and may be counterproductive if it inhibits the free flow of information which makes the Internet so valuable. In the final analysis, the health and well-being of the Internet **is the  responsibility of its users who must, uniformly, guard against abuses which disrupt the system and threaten its long-term viability.** (emphasis added)

In the same way, it is the responsibility of the users to guard against threats of disruption against the Bitcoin network.

There may be different opinions on what exactly that means for the present governance conflict. But everyone should probably agree that any activity intentionally disrupting the Bitcoin network is unethical and unacceptable.

The procedure for adopting Internet standards basically requires showing [two things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard#Internet_Standards). 

&gt;An Internet Standard is characterized by a high degree of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet community. 

Applying these requirements to new proposed Bitcoin rules would mean: Your proposed rule would need to be """"technically mature"""" (disqualifying the """"Bitcoin Unlimited"""" proposal) and """"generally supported"""" (disqualifying it again).

In contrast, you can't get an Internet protocol approved by hash power majority independent of the above requirements. I think that's a good thing for Internet governance. It should be the same for Bitcoin governance.

1765,"Bitcoin can be used in many places same as fiat currency.  The unique trait is that is can be used globally.  Bitcoin will never replace fiat currency since it is only an internet currency and as much as people want to think everyone is on the internet, that's not the case.

Also, there are people who want to save and earn interest on their checking or savings.  Although bitcoin should continue to rise in price, my estimation is up to $2 Trillion USD, it may eventually level out.  Bitcoin will never pay interest.  People will continue to take out loans and pay back interest.  Reasonably this is difficult with bitcoin.  This is where banks make their money.

As for diluting fiat currencies, let's say that bitcoin does reach $2 Trillion in value.  It is $2 Trillion made up of a small fraction of currencies around the world rather than $2 Trillion in Yuan, Dollars, Euros, or Pounds.  It's impact directly to any one currency is negligible.  

It's the unknown or ignorance that makes banks fear bitcoin.  Instead, they need to think and say, how can we make a buck with this, e.g,, ATM's, Conversions to fiat for small spending, collateral for loans, etc. 

Bitcoin is the best way for businesses to transact globally reducing transaction costs and improving cash flow.  Imagine your cutting a few days off your receivables and turning that into working capital.

Japan is the first major country to grab onto this starting today.  When the rest of industrialized countries realize this, they will see that this is the future.

1769,"Preamble you can skip if you want: I'm as guilty as many on both sides of snarky, smart-arse comments but tonight I just spent a very enjoyable hour (doing a face-to-face trade) with two who hold different opinions than me. I think we all learned something and I'm confident we all had more respect for the legitimacy of holding a different view from ourselves.

My primary point is that a technical expertise does not make one an economics expert and therefore there's a danger in trusting the technical experts to make the decisions that risk what has proven to work thus far i.e. enough space to accommodate almost all transactions.

I wanted, since visiting Sudan in the mid nineties, a currency that would protect people in countries from government actions that truly screw them over such as the monthly doubling the money supply to pay the army (that doubled the price of everything on the day the army was paid).

I had figured out in the years after that public key cryptography might be the basis of an independent currency and was hoping someone smarter than me might figure it out. But even though I was kinda expecting it I was still blown away by the elegance of Satoshi's solution.

One of the exciting things was that the same currency served the needs of so many different groups of people including: the Austrians / gold-bug types, libertarians / ancaps and others including me who see value in an incorruptible currency, people screwed by high remittance fees or by gov't restrictions of internal or international currency transfer, the unbanked who are cut off from financial services most here take for granted, its use for contracts such as with Factom - even those, such as me -  who liked to give small amounts away* or raise intrigue with shopkeepers, restaurant owners by offering physical (or later wallet app) bitcoins for my meal etc. etc. The fact that there were, in addition, so many use cases that we could not even imagine what they might be was just mind-blowing for me.

The failure to do something about the transaction bottleneck before it started to nudge fees up and (and/or cause delays orders of magnitude higher than before) is and will continue to have an impact. This isn't about laying blame today. I think it's fair to say all stakeholders (in the wider use of the term) including developers, miners, other users and moderators jointly - if not equally - have to-date failed to make a change a user can use today.

I am looking forward to seeing 2nd layer off-chain solutions bringing all kinds of new use cases. I also mourn the loss of the use of the blockchain for the other use cases as their viability is eroded to nothing by fees and delays.

As I see it, those whose judgement on Bitcoin's future has apparently earned the respect of the majority on this sub due to their technical merit, have a plan that accepts the loss of the multitude of use cases (on-chain) as a price worth paying to have Bitcoin be as strong as possible for the three use cases they deem worthy: censorship-resistant-currency, store-of-value, settlement-layer.

If this argument continues to prevent the increase of the block-size limit, as much as I'd like to see them proven wrong, I genuinely hope that Bitcoin will continue to be of value to enough for merely those three use cases to survive and to thrive. The fact is we don't know. Nobody can know. The combination of use cases and unlimited potential use cases was what got us to where we are today. How long can we chip away at the other use cases and still have something that holds value? Maybe indefinitely? It depends entirely on the faith and the preparedness of those who stay in to pull us out of whatever next big dip is. It is still a significantly inflationary currency and the higher up the price goes, with more coming on board at higher prices, the further it has to fall. And we ought not forget it is not the only player in the crypto space.

From what I understand of 2nd layer channels, they're not going to serve the Sudanese and those in the many countries where the spread of mobile telephony means they could potentially exchange what for us are small amounts to protect themselves. My hope is that Bitcoin can still do this - as I believe was the vision of Satoshi and as I understand some with a much better technical understanding than me (GA, for one) believe is still possible.

But if it's not Bitcoin, I'm kinda hoping for the sake of what it once was that it survives and continues to reward those who believed in it but more importantly, if it's not Bitcoin, I'm really hoping another currency will take up the baton for those who most need use of this technology - and if that is at the cost of Bitcoin falling by the wayside, so be it. We - jointly, as a whole community - will only have ourselves to blame.

In the beginning Satoshi always noted to keep a level playing field. This is always the goal. The malicious miner was always going to be on attack mode. This is what we are learning in real time. Honest miners will always do what's called for for the protocol. Not their best interest. Miners were to be slightly profitable. This enables them to perform proof of work. Having an advantage that doesn't benefits to protocol is not a benefit. It's an attack. So hearing Greg call out this attack is greatly appreciated. Decentralization is the goal. Competitive advantages can be tolerated till they attack decentralization. Bitmain holding back the protocol to stall or divert it is an attack. 

A gentlemans agreement was always about keeping the playing field as level as possible. Letting the market decide is a bug. The code and nodes determine or decide. 

Satoshi called for having one implementations running. Not two or three. Just one. We live with this error everyday BU exist. It gives the malicious miner a field to play on. 

Satoshi is the one who lowered the blocksize to prevent spam. Malicious miner spam. If you noticed when Antpool decentralized the tx amounts have increased. Miner spam.

1778,"Activating the Segwit proposal [requires 95% of mining hash power to """"signal support"""" for it](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/27/segwit-upgrade-guide/).

This may be understood as a vote, with giving a small minority veto power. But there is a different way to see this process.

At [segwit.org](https://segwit.org/user-activated-soft-forks-the-bip-148-alternative-28e87ffdb76f), one finds this explanation:

&gt;I thought miners vote on proposals?

&gt;Miner activated soft forks are a convenient shortcut to activating soft forks because it allows the changes to activate before a significant portion of the economy upgrades. The signalling process is just to coordinate when a supermajority of hashrate has upgraded, nodes can then activate and begin enforcing the new rules. It was never intended to be a vote although it has an unintentional veto where a small amount of hash power can hold up the process.

In other words, the """"signaling"""" language assumes that there is no valid reason to oppose a new proposal and the only question is if miners are paying attention and are not too lazy to upgrade their systems. """"Signal support"""" means only declaring that they have done the homework necessary for everyone to proceed in lockstep.

That makes sense.

In contrast, having miners vote on proposals in the first place may be a bad idea, especially considering recently discovered possible conflicts of interest. And even if one would want to have a voting system giving all the power to the miners, it wouldn't make much sense to give a small block of 5% veto power.

So what was the intent of that """"95%"""" requirement? Was that supposed to be a vote? Should this be a vote? What exactly does """"signaling support"""" mean?"
1779,"Besides undoubtedly appreciating my very catchy title, I was wondering if smarter minds than mine might comment on this:

Jihan Wu is under electron-microscope scrutiny right now. If Bitmain were covertly using AsicBoost tech, do they dare continue? It would seem to me that the smartest, safest move - in light of the fact they have denied using it covertly - would be to stop immediately, to avoid any risk of getting caught.

But if that's the case, isn't it equally likely that the proverbial electron microscopes will pick up the decreased 20%-30% efficiency advantage that AsicBoost gave them? IOW, won't the abrupt and timely change be obvious?

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I am a strong believer in overwhelming circumstantial evidence. And if we have anything, it's strong circumstantial evidence. I believe Bitmain has been using AsicBoost, and I think they're freaking out - quite possibly because of the catch 22 position I have just outlined.

Thoughts? Someone(s) please show me that I'm off-base here. "

1781,"Just kidding. I shrugged and held it. I do have a real question though. I've only half been following the SegWit stuff, so I wanted some clarification.

1: assuming no crazy fork happens, which is looking less likely, my btc will remain as is after SegWit implementation, right? Like if I have btc on a trezor in storage and go on vacation for 2 years, when I come back it's still btc and spendable right? No need for me to do anything during the SegWit setup?

2: after SegWit is a thing, will I need to do something different to use it, like make a lightning wallet? Will all that be handled in the background or with minimal user input for users of apps like Mycelium?"

1790,"It is true that fees have been rising. Some people are worried about that. Therefore, it may be of interest to take a closer look.

I used the charts at blockchain.info to find out total fees per day, number of transactions per day, and estimated transaction volume for April 2012 to April 2017. Then I divided the estimated transaction volume per day by the number of transactions to estimate the average transaction value of each transaction. Dividing the total fee by the number of transactions gives the average fee for one transaction. And I also calculated the total fee in relation to the total transaction volume, in percentage points. I came up with the following estimates.

For 2012, average transaction value was $133, fees per transaction were basically zero, and 0% of transaction value.

For 2013, average transaction value goes up to $581, average fee is $0.13, and total fees are 0.02% of transaction volume.

For 2014, average transaction value is up again to $802, fee per transaction is $0.10 and percentage of transaction volume is 0.012%.

For 2015, average transaction value goes down to $359, average fee is $0.03, and percentage of transaction volume is 0.01%.

For 2016, average transaction value goes down again to $362, average fee is $0.08, and percentage of transaction volume is 0.01%.

And for April 10, 2017 I find average transaction value of $1188, average fee at $0.89, and percentage of transaction volume at 0.08%.

If so, 0.08% does not impress me as a dangerously high value. If you are sending $1188, you won't mind paying 89 cents in fees for that.

If both sides in the scaling debate succeed in blocking each other's proposals for another year or two, we might see some even higher fees. Maybe they will even approach something like one percent of transaction volume.

In that case, we will gain some experience on when exactly users start bailing out because of high fees, as opposed to only speculating in theory about the issue. As it stands, 0.08% of volume is still far too low to price Bitcoin out of the money transmission market.

1791,"I need an alternative to coinbase. Coin base makes it extremely easy to get Bitcoin, you just use your debit card option, and it's in your account as bitcoins. Circle used to be just as easy.

Now to the point - I've been using bitcoin for a few years now, though I'm an infrequent user, and only buy and use coin as and when I need it - about once a month or two. Until recently I never had much trouble.

However - in the past few months I've been encountering extreme waiting times for coin to move, and from what I've read, the only solution might be to add a transaction fee. 
I've been using Multibit classic so far, so never had a choice to add any, though I've now downloaded Multibit HD, but I don't have a clue as to how to calculate an appropriate fee to add to my transaction.

I don't know enough about the workings and the maths behind bitcoin, and trying to figure out fee per kb or any of the formulas I've come across feels like it's going over my head.

Could someone really simply explain the best (and cheapest. Sorry, I just can't afford much) way to add enough of a fee so my transactions get confirmed?

At the same time the electricity footprint for the bitcoin ecosystem would go way down - but since the difficulty can be adjusted - it will make no difference to usefulness/transactions.

On the second round , Only the first and the second in rank of the first round results will stay for the choosing. 

The thing is :

On all this candidates, a lot of them wants to leave EU. and even go back to french money instead of euros . Only Macron, FIllon  and Hamon , want France to stay in the EU.Of course you can understand the impact on the money, the savings and more globally to the economy.

Some of them are considered very dangerous for the economy like LePen and Melenchon (extreme right and left)

Right now the poll says the top competitors are LePen , Macron, Melenchon , Hamon.

Let's imagine what could be consider as a worst case scenario , LePen vs Melenchon on second round . Some french people (actually I'm one of them ) would get scared and would probably rush to get money out of the bank .(like Greece or Brexit ) 

Moreover the rest of Europe would be scared too due to the consequences of France leaving EU .

1829,"Selgin defines commodity money to be, for example, gold that arises as units of settlement between major banks. I've always argued bitcoin will arise to serve as this effectively replacing gold (or SDR's the IMF uses etc.).

Selgin also notes that as the money tends towards ideal supply through a naturally approached equilibrium process less of the actual commodity is needed and thus it is freed up for other uses.

Gold might be then used for space equipment etc.

But there is seemingly no need or want to structure bitcoin to do this.  

What would it matter if the participating banks used 21 million bitcoins or 1 million bitcoins or 500 bitcoins and the rest were used for other purposes other than settlement? 

It would also necessary effect the price/value of a bitcoin which is counterproductive to a stable unit of value.

What is also interesting is if we consider this argument then bitcoin is really nothing new in regard to a settlement system, its simply the commodity money Selgin describes.

But the blockchain provides tamper proof security which is a residue left over from the process.  It's what is really the new technology and yet it doesn't really add to the utility of bitcoins.

1830,"I'm not too updated on the entire history of this but in light of recent events I think we have enough information.

Ver is too smart to believe his own bullshit.

The BU articles of federation gives complete control of mining to Jihan.

That Ver supported mount Gox with a massively sly foxy smile seems relevant and connected.

Ver supposed has a ton of bitcoin (or not?), perhaps with a question of whether or not they are tied up somehow.

I'd like people to consider that r/btc is full of ESL (Asians?) that are hired to pose as westerners (ie English as a FIRST language) posters who constantly spread obvious lies and fud against obvious truth and (computer) science/scientists.

But ASIC's seem to be too centralized and sway power too much, like this one man in China that builds 70% of all Bitcoin ASIC's.

I know people talk about this a lot but I wonder why it's not considered more seriously.

I know that eventually people would make an ASIC no matter your algo, so could you change your PoW every X years to focus on GPU usage, shutting out ASIC miners again and again?

Of course you can't just switch from one algo to another in one block, so it would have a be a transitional change over a period of blocks where the new algo is phased in.

On a real note... holders continue to hold and investors do serious research before buying as any investment is a serious risk and don't listen to speculators who """"KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT WILL BE 1000% GAINS BY X DATE"""" ... it's all just pump and dump for those people... Good luck :D

Lawnmower.io published a study in 2016 showing that nearly 12 million Bitcoin are held in addresses that contain less than $.61 each. That is nearly 3/4ths of the total market cap. As fees continue to climb, how will these small amounts of Bitcoin continue to move without being totally wiped out with fees?

1856,"asking for a friend

who believes in exchanges"
1857,"1. There are certain structural oversights in Bitcoin that need to be fixed. Without fixing this altcoins will probably overtake Bitcoin in the long run.  
  
2. SegWit has several [benefits](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/) including short term higher transaction capacity, long term much higher transaction capacity through second level transactions and also safe (!) increasing of the block size. Additionally it will make it easier for smart contracts and the like to build on Bitcoin directly. If Satoshi would design Bitcoin from scratch today he would probably do it in a similar manner.  
  
3. SegWit is a good solution, ready for action and well tested. Even some of it's strongest opponents secretly admit it is """"good"""" ([verified chatlogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/67nc2r/verified_chatlogs_why_jihan_and_jiang_want_to/)).  
  
4. There are two possible ways to deploy/implement SegWit, as a softfork (SWSF) or as a hardfork (SWHF). A hardfork would allow a slightly cleaner implementation but would also require replay protection (as the exchanges have specifically asked for lately). SWSF does not require replay protection assuming a hashrate majority. Replay protection is difficult thus SWHF would altogether cause more technical debt than SWSF. Also a hardfork is generally considered of higher risk and would take longer preparation time.  
  
5. Because of a block verification processing time vulnerability that increases quadratically with block size, increasing the block size is only possible AFTER SegWit is active and only for SegWit transactions. There might be alternative solutions but these will require more computing resources and do not scale as good with larger block size.  
  
6. Any alternative to SegWit SF would take at least half a year longer in implementation and testing.  
  
7. A large mining hardware manufacturer and a rich early adopter are trying to prevent SegWit from being activated, probably because of financial incentives and/or power political reasons ([verified chatlogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/67nc2r/verified_chatlogs_why_jihan_and_jiang_want_to/)).  
  
8. It is safe to ignore the Hong Kong agreement as it was never 'officially' signed by 'Core' (and other reasons). If you feel like bringing it up chances are you should research it some more.  
  
9. Watching altcoins with SegWit flourish pressure from the users will become so high that Bitcoin finally will get SegWit, probably by the miners accepting SWSF after all.  
  
10. Expect interference from the establishment and altcoin investors to fuel conflicts within the Bitcoin community. Educate yourselves thoroughly, stick to the facts and be polite.

1858,"I'm a reasonably compentant software dev, but not a Bitcoin developer. In recent months I've seen numerous posts about people who start running full nodes to """"signal support for Segwit"""".

As I support and believe in the Core devs / Segwit I wanted to also show my support as well so I bought a Raspberry Pi and setup a fullnode. A couple weeks later, I have the full blockchain and it's purring along =)

I wanted to run a few more (my office, girlfriends, etc..) to show even more support. However, a dev friend who's studied BTC &amp; blockchains more extensively than I, said running extra nodes won't help in this debate, only adding more hashing power will. 

Can someone better explain- is my dev friend partially right? Fully right? Are there caveats? As per [Jihan's anti-Pi Tweet](https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/861446509115592704) there must be some truth to one side of this."

This is an opportunity unprecedented in human history.  A disruption of the status quo is in the palm of everyone's hands.  Money drives the modern world.  We can redefine the units of value along with the players who hodl the most.  THIS is the single most important aspect of what we are dealing with and the fact that the U.S. government hasn't shut it out yet should tell everyone that the banks are looking to exploit it in the short term and maybe in the long term as well.

Very powerful people have been watching closely this experiment for many years and I believe that they are about to take action to curtail the rise of this alternative monetary system.

If you think that they will just sit idly and watch unregulated Cryptocurrencies take over the established monetary order, you are gravely mistaken. They have spent a hundred years putting it into place and they will never relinquish their power over it.

They have faith in these new technologies and they have plans for it, but the decentralized nature and libertarian philosophy that Bitcoin was built upon are the very antithesis of what they are aiming for, which is a cashless, hyper-centralized economy, where every single transaction can be traced down to an IP address associated with someone and with his real identity.

That's the end goal. Everything else is just temporary.

The result of this whole experiment in the end might end up being the total opposite of what Satoshi envisioned when he created Bitcoin, and that is, absolute, hyper-centralized, worldwide and total control of the monetary system."

Next I found out about a plaintext attack on zip files the specific one I'm using is called PKCrack.  This requires at least 12 bytes of information from one of the files in the encrypted zip. This is where I am stuck. I have about 3 BTC wallet backups all encrypted and a doge wallet backup that I'm not sure if I encrypted or not. Is their any common information in a wallet that I can use for this plaintext attack or does anybody no any other way that I could recover this.

1886,"I was contemplating making a full node as a piece of hardware the size of a cell phone. An ARM CPU and/or an FPGA, expandable storage, WiFi, a battery to last it a few hours/days unplugged, etc. A device purpose-designed to be a full node and be reasonably future-proof for several years.

Such a node should be able to run from anywhere where there is power and internet.

* Allows you to free up your computer and use a low profile/power/noise device instead. 
* Allows spreading nodes around - it's easier to plug in a little thing into a socket than to keep a PC running
* Natural malware resistance (no Windows on the thing, open source software and/or Linux with easy update capability)

Bonus features:

* Can act as a wallet, fully autonomous and trustless
* Could probably be designed with a full transaction index capability, thus acting as your personal block explorer
* Potential for hardware-only perks (i.e. in case of an FPGA it can act as an efficient vanitygen, a hardware random number generator can be added, etc)

So, the question is - is there a use case for such a device?

Alternatively, have a device like that been made before or in existence now?"

This has happened to me before. The ATM has timed out on me twice, but on both occasions I got my Bitcoin about an hour later. However, this time I got my receipt and all, so i didn't even think to check.. There was no time out or ATM reboot or anything. 

So here I am 12 hours later and I still do NOT have my Bitcoin. Since I did not get my Bitcoin I ended up going to another Bitcoin ATM (this time """"Rocketcoin"""" which is more expensive). I tested it out with $100.00 and I received my Bitcoin instantly, like usual, so I bought another $220.0 with no problem at all, again i got my bitcoin instantly.

In fact based on the gossips I doubt they will present a reasonable way forward, but these are just gossips. The 0bin leak is not a credible source.

You are refusing something based on the people who came up with it and the way they came up with it, without even knowing the content.  
Remember, it doesn't matter if Satoshi was a pedo-terrorist and while creating Bitcoin he was constantly jerking off to Gavin Andresen's photo or not. What matters is Bitcoin was created.
