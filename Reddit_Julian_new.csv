1901,"I was completely oblivious that selling cryptocurrency from person to person in NYC is illegal, a federal offense and charged as money laundering.

What if, the buyer and seller (me) verbally agreed that I would sell him a [Insert Tangible Item Here] for '$x' amount of cash and I will send him 'X' amount of BTC for free.

Can I avoid potential criminal charges using this method? I'm actually in the process of meeting someone up to sell ETH. After reading up for a good hour, feeling freaked out and paranoid would be an understatement."

1915,"For the last several years I have been reiterating that wallets were nodes and miners. Nodes and miners were separated because of the mining race. The only way to recorrect the balance was to incentivize nodes to operate and decrease the centralization affect of mining. I was told constantly that I was wrong because miners would not want to hurt the system if they wanted to profit from it.  

I beleive user activated soft fork is the first step to say to the miners that it's time for the centralization and power plays to stop. When lightning network gets running on Bitcoin, and less fees are ran through miners, this will tell them that it's too much. If they want more profit, then they will need to run either better hardware or dial down the difficulty level so the power consumption needed to mine is less.  

This is how we can bring low-power consumption mining back and merge wallets and miners together again.  

If someone decides they rather use a liteweight or pruned wallet, that's fine, they just wont receive those bits, but the service provider node can so they can support the wallets.  

Return the balance to Bitcoin and let it grow the way it was supposed to do. UASF now please."

A prototype is ready and the plan is to start a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, and I'm collecting opinions on the device.


From the bitcoin perspective it offers a secure storage of bitcoin keys on a secure microcontroller with hardware crypto, all operations are pin protected and a press of a touch button is required to confirm a transaction. From software side it integrates with the Electrum wallet. Full bip39 hierarchical deterministic wallet is offered.


In addition the device works as an openPGP smart card, U2F authenticator and an OTP generator.

1923,"The 51% attack is a misnomer.

You need to mine 6 blocks in a row. Over the course of 1 month you would have a virtual certainty (99,2%) of hitting such a streak with only 35% hashing power of the network.

I have lost a lot of money being dumb currency trading and would technically be owed tenfold more than I would be required to pay in for my gains. However, I am turning this around after years of learning how to handle this beast and am starting to become worried about taxes. 

I plan on waiting(not sure if good idea) to pay taxes until there is an easier way to do so. I am asking if this is a good idea. 

I have losses from 4 years ago that I never recorded and figured if the IRS wanted me to pay taxes(if I owe any) They can help me figure out how much they owe me.. 

So at this point I am just going to wait unless I would happen to get extremely lucky with someones dumb market buy that netted me a few dozen bitcoin. Then I wouldn't care about what I owed and could mentally write off all my previous losses.

Biggest thing that erks me is, to hell I will pay taxes on something when currently my losses far outweigh my gains.

In preparation for sending the entire balance to my current wallet, I used the old version of MultiBit HD to send a small deposit to my current wallet. This has been in limbo for quite a while (about a week), as it would seem that the version of MultiBit I was running did not send a sufficient transaction fee. As a result, the failed transaction seems to have resulted in an 'inconsistent state' of the wallet, which has locked me out of access to it via password-only access.

I have a Coinbase account that is currently holding a small amount of bitcoin inside it's vault (everything else is in my hardware wallet) and nothing else (though I did use it to originally buy my bitcoin).

Anyways, earlier today I got an email and message on login to coinbase to enable 2FA - except I already have had 2FA enabled since day 1 (using authy). 

Also, when I went to log on coinbase, it showed the 2FA screen normally.


I don't know what to do - when I go to setup 2FA via the coinbase message on login, it shows another QR code. I'm afraid that if I set this up, that it will invalidate my current 2FA/cause my account to be locked/lose access to my account.

TL,DR: Coinbase sent me an email telling me to enable 2FA when I've had 2FA enabled for the entire time I've had the account. Glitch or did some hacker mess with my 2FA?

A recent paper shows that one character in 30 from a random string is copied wrong^([citation needed]). So you check it 200 times and it looks right. Well, do yourself a favor and just check it once, then test it. Do as if your original wallet exists no more and rely only on the copied information. Make a new wallet, or whatever, out of it and check if it works. If it does, you not only know that your info is correct but also that your copy is readable and it has no ambiguity (like with 1 and l), which you have no way to check when you just compare it with the original."

Because higher fees make mining more profitable from 2 income sources - 12.5btc rewards and user fees. This leads to more investment in securing the blockchain, leading to greater confidence in the network, leading to more investment from both miners and users looking for stores of value.

1968,"Hi everyone,
 
My name is Oliver and I am a graduate student at the Technical University of Munich. For my final thesis I am doing research on cryptocurrency mining and have put together a survey to better understand the motivations and behavior of miners.
 
If you have mined Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin/Dash/Monero or any other cryptocurrency with your own hardware (not just through cloud mining) in the past, or are still doing so today, you are welcome to participate in the survey. The survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. All participants who complete the survey are eligible to enter a raffle for the chance to win 20 EUR worth of BTC or ETH. Three winners will be drawn at random on June 30th and 20 EUR worth of BTC or ETH will be sent to each of the winners’ wallets on the same day.
 
The survey is located here:
[https://ww3.unipark.de/uc/cryptominingsurvey/](https://ww3.unipark.de/uc/cryptominingsurvey/)

All survey responses are collected only for the purpose of my final thesis and will be treated confidentially.
 
If you have any questions about the study, I am happy to answer them. You can PM me, post them here, or address them at the end of the survey.
 
Thank you for your help! I am happy to share the results of the study with you once the survey is completed.

I don't think we should embark in any risky forks until there is overwhelming consensus among honest actors.

Note that I said """"honest actors"""".  I think we'll only achieve that overwhelming consensus when it becomes 100% clear to everyone that Jihan &amp; Co have been acting in bad faith, and that all reasonable attempts at finding a compromise have been exhausted.

Therefore, as a matter of strategy, I think UASF supporters should first propose a soft-fork which kills covert ASICboost and nothing else.  All outcomes from this proposal are positive: if it gets rejected by Jihan &amp; Co, then their deception will have been exposed in the most vivid way possible, and support for a UASF will skyrocket; if it gets activated, then I'm pretty sure that soon after Jihan &amp; Co will find themselves much more friendly towards Segwit. To save face they'll probably say the change of heart was caused by Litecoin demonstrating that Segwit is safe, or something along these lines...
    
Finally, I would like for the adults in the room to step up and propose a scaling compromise that takes into account the interests of all the parties in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Remember that besides end users, the ecosystem also includes exchanges, miners, developers, and merchants.

I think that Segwit2Mb is a reasonable starting point. I would support it if some the technical shortcomings were to be fixed, the schedule was not so aggressive (I'd prefer 9 months to a year before the hard-fork, with a slow ramp up to 2MB blocks afterwards), and most importantly, if the proposal was fixed and blessed by Core developers.

Update: other applications installed into /windows/ like sleep study and similar to help the hackers run the mining app only when users are away. Doesn't seem they got it right luckily, but definitely keep an eye out for CCminer running

1998,"A bunch of economically significant participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have signed an agreement to ostensibly run code that would hard fork away from Bitcoin Core code later this fall.  Why?  And what will happen?


At the time of signing the agreement, the economically significant participants (some with hundreds of millions of USD on the line) must surely each have been aware that attempting to enforce a contentious hard fork would lead to severe risk of two chains, attacks, disruption, confusion, and lasting damage to Bitcoin's reputation, value and usage.


The participants must all now continue to be aware that attempting to ram through a contentious hard fork based on rushed code produced by a small handful of developers in a semi-closed process, with almost no time for testing and coordination with other ecosystem participants, will quite possibly result in a colossal clusterfuck.


Thus - provided that the participants have not been fully co-opted by forces hostile to Bitcoin's increased adoption, and provided that they are not otherwise no longer motivated by rational pursuit of their own economic self-interest - one would have to conclude that, regardless of their public statements or commitments, the participants will not be willing to actually move forward with such an unreasonably risky hard fork.


If so, as an uninformed outside observer, how then could one explain the fact of these economically significant participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem publicly pledging to honor an agreement that appears to commit them to a path heading directly into this unreasonable risk?


For a large fraction of the parties to the agreement, it seems reasonable to infer that signing the agreement simply represents pragmatic temporary signalling to move past a political deadlock, with the unspoken but clearly rational intent of shifting their stance on the timing and deployment of the 2x block size hard fork portion of the pledge, after Segwit activation, based on the obvious challenges a rushed non-unanimous hardfork would pose.


However, it also seems that some of the economically significant participants, in particular some of the miners, may have signed the agreement fully intending to run Segwit2x code, and may find it very difficult to explicitly back away from this pledge, either due to external pressures and/or being unwilling to lose face.  


If those miners indeed earnestly follow through on their pledge, did the other agreement participants miscalculate?  The prospect of substantial hashpower actually running Segwit2x code after Segwit activation would, at first glance, seem to imply the real chance of a contentious hard fork occurring this fall.


On further consideration, what seems most likely to happen is that the miners will indeed run Segwit2x code, and on the surface meet their publicly stated commitment, but those miners will simply set their **soft limit** such that they continue to mine segwit blocks that small enough to be valid according to Bitcoin Core code.  


It would be easy to justify the soft limit as a temporary measure to allow time for """"further testing"""" and adoption of """"Segwit2x-compatible code"""" by more of the other nodes who variously were or were not party to the agreement.


After a couple years of further work and research, a hard fork to some form of larger block size might independently be developed, tested and accepted by Bitcoin core; in the meantime, soft limits would continue to be used as a means for miners actually continuing to run Segwit2x code to maintain compatibility with the vastly more prevalent majority of nodes continuing to run battle tested, well-maintained Bitcoin core code.


If this theory proves true, there may be many moments of fear and uncertainty between now and this fall, with plenty of posturing and sound and fury, and the Bitcoin price could dip substantially at points - but in reality those dips might be some of the last opportunities to add meaningful amounts of Bitcoin to one's holdings before the next phase of 2nd layer scaling solutions starts unfolding, and the value of Bitcoin takes off on another upleg, never to look back.

**BREAKING bitcoin hardware wallets**

this is the intro:
""""The security of your bitcoins rests entirely in the security of your private key. Bitcoin hardware wallets help protect against software-based attacks to recover or misuse your key. However, hardware attacks on these wallets are not as well studied. In 2015, Jochen Hoenicke was able to extract the private key from a TREZOR using a simple power analysis technique. While that vulnerability was patched, he suggested the Microcontroller on the TREZOR, which is also the same on the KeepKey, may be vulnerable to additional side channel attacks.

In this presentation we will quickly overview fault injection techniques, timing, and power analysis methods using the Open Source Hardware tool, the ChipWhisperer. We then show how to apply these techniques to the STM32F205 which is the MCU on the Trezor and KeepKey. Lastly, we will present our findings of a timing attack vulnerability and conclude with software and hardware recommendations to improve bitcoin hardware wallets. We will show and share our tools and methods to help you get started in breaking your own wallet!

Yesterday afternoon, [/u/thisisforyounow](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisforyounow) started a bit of a treasure hunt over in Mountain View, CA.

I've been playing with bitcoin for a few months now, and happened to stumble upon the thread advertising the start of the hunt.

My sister and I headed over this morning, arriving when it opened at 10am, and searched for about 3 hours. Plenty of other people there looking, trying to be inconspicuous about peeking behind placards and the such.

We tried plenty to solve clues but didn't have many leads, so, like the many others there, our search was a bruteforce quest. We went through the gallery at least two dozen times, until we finally realized the potential of the undersides of a few benches.

The museum is fascinating, and we hadn't been since we first moved here, and it was a great experience.

2017,"Here it goes:
In the early days of Bitcoin the was no bip32 and addresses were generated from random (underived) private keys.
The downside of this approach is that over time the number of private keys grows and you need to constantly update your backup file to include newly generated keys. That means you can not """"backup once and forget"""". User-unfriendly approach. Also, it was as obvious as 2x2 that backup file with private keys *should be encrypted* with a *strong password* and the same in case of printed QR with encoded key. And as we are dealing with potential offline brute-force attack, the strong password is nothing less secure than diceware generated &gt;=6 word pass (this is as well user-unfriendly).

## Printed QR
This sheet of paper is vulnerable to fire/water and no less importantly: lost.
So the good approach for the printed key is to store it in a fire resistant safe encrypted with a strong password.
- Not something average person can do
- Does not work for daily wallets

## File with private keys
Suitable for daily wallets but should be updated after each transaction. blockchain.info used to provide this option: you could attach Dropbox or receive emails with updated backup file after each transaction. Your keys are safe as long as you remember your password and it is *strong*.

In my opinion, this backup technique was the closest to the most secure and user friendly solution for daily wallets; strong password is something average user still can't understand, however.

## Two concepts emerged over time to address the above stated issues:
- BIP32 for deterministic key generation
- Hardware wallets as cheap and secure replacement for expensive safes

So nowadays we do have a way to *backup once and forget* but almost nobody (including me, probably) understands how to do that the right way.

Let's look at Trezor security model. I still need to backup my seed to a paper recovery card. Am I the only one who finds this practice insane? And the same goes for *every Bitcoin wallet out there*. Every software wallet app tells me to back my 12 words in a *safe place*, but no one of them specifies what a safe place actually is. And for most users the backup goes as follows:
1. Write down 12 words on a sheet of paper
2. Put this sheet of paper somewhere (in a desk/book ect)
Because what else can be more secure than a sheet of paper? 
**Be your own bank, fuck yeah**.

I have been trying to figure out the solution to this dilemma that is suitable for most potential crypto-users who are not tech-savvy and here is the scheme. It relies on smartphones as I can't imagine most people using something different to transact in Bitcoin.

Please note that It hardly relies on Apple hardware and ecosystem. I am sorry to all android users out there but here are my thoughts about why this is so important:
1. Android is a cybersecurity nightmare. **A pro-user can tune his android to be secure as well as to choose the good model from the market**. **Average user is the one who never receives security updates, installs shitty software and likely just bought a fancy new device from china that is factory rooted**. Hell. I don't want this thread to be about Android vs Apple, but if you have a solution that does not rely on seed-on-a-paper backup I will listen to it with pleasure.
2. On the other hand we have Apple with their secure-enclaved iPhones and iCloud Keychain. To understand security of iCloud Keychain one needs to go [here](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Krstic.pdf) TL;DR once iCloud Keychain was initiated and rolled out to the public it is secure as rock (provided that initiation was not compromised: very unlikely cause leakage will cost Apple it's face). To understand the security of iPhone with secure enclave one needs to go [here](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) and [here](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Mandt-Demystifying-The-Secure-Enclave-Processor.pdf). TL;DR is that such an iPhone with latest iOS has unprecedented level of security that is light years ahead of competitors. That said, nothing is ideal and iPhone has it's weaknesses, but in practice there is no known successful attack on record out there. Think of iPhone [+software wallet that utilizes keychain (not iCloud)] like a **hardware wallet by itself** (with separate hardware and operating system running under the hood) that is manufactured by a huge company (means many audits their products for security) can't say the same for Bitcoin hardware wallet manufacturers.

## How a wallet should help people keep their bitcoins in **secure** AND **accessible** manner (big IMO)

### During the first launch a wallet should:

1. Generate a 12-word mnemonic. I consider it the best practice (and a privilege of a smartphone) to use additional sources of entropy like a feed from sensors (touch screen, accelerometer, gyroscope and with certain permission: camera). No hardware wallet out there relies on additional entropy, and to date, only few software wallets utilize this technic ( [Bither](https://bither.net/) is one of them)
2. Ask a user to enter emoji-pass that consist of 8 emojis from a special emoji-list (😝). Like a word list for diceware passwords / wallet mnemonic, emoji-list consists of only special emoticons that are easily distinguishable and represent well known meanings, that said: no all shades of emotions, no gender/race related emojis etc. The alfa-version of such a list is available [here](https://pastebin.com/RPXhd0nT). These 8 emojis are used as a """"passphrase"""" during BIP39 binary seed derivation. After that stage, mnemonic and emoji-pass are stored inside **local** keychain.

Some clarification: provided that an attacker knows 12 word mnemonic, he needs to compute:
- 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 (312 emojis from an emoji-list in the power of 8) different binary seeds (each takes 2048 rounds of sha512)
- 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 addresses (one [ex. external] address from BIP44 notation for each binary seed). Provided that it's guaranteed from a wallet source that the first (or i-th) external address will be shown to user and potentially used for transaction. That could be hardened by using a random i-th external address from some (even small) range
- Compare the above set of addresses with all addresses from a blockchain to determine whether correct seed was generated)
As far as I know, 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 combinations is considered a safe for password. In our case we have an additional anti brute-force measure (2048 round of sha512 + comparison to addresses from blockchain. I would be glad for some realworld info (math) regarding speed of bruteforce in that particular case, but I dare to say that even if attacker has access to a supercomputer or a powerful botnet, user will have time to transfer bitcoins in another wallet).

### During sometime after user is onboard
A wallet should give an advice to enable iCloud Keychain storage for 12 word mnemonic. There should be a foolproof system that will 1. Let the user memorize an emoji-pass by providing a simple trainer that asks to enter pass many times and in different forms through some period of time 2. Examines the user before the mnemonic is finally backed up into iCloud Keychain.
Of course, user is advised to set a strong password for his Apple ID and enable 2FA with an explanation that clarifies importance of these steps.
Please notice that emoji-pass never leaves the device. Moreover, it can be stored in such a manner that system deletes it after some period of time and/or after reboot. In that way a user will more likely memorize his emoji-pass  forever (or notice the problem before some big amount of bitcoins is in game).

### What's good about emoji-pass
- The character set is ~30 times bigger than numeric (pins used by many wallet providers as additional security) and ~3 times bigger than all-space set
- Being picture representation of some meanings (words) emoji-sequence can be memorized with much better success and ease than word-sequence. Additionally, they are extremely popular around the globe and hiding the 12-word unlocalized mnemonic behind the scenes increases the user-friendliness of the software dramatically.
The threat model shifts from: """"backup your fucking mnemonic wherever you want, it's not our problem"""" to """"set-up one good password plus 2FA for your Apple ID, memorize these fancy emojis and you are safe to go and switch devices as often as you need""""
Even if user does not have a good password and 2FA, **he will receive a notification** that his account is compromised and will have enough time to secure his bitcoins.

I am  open for criticism, but I do need to know how the community perceive this dilemma of wallet back up.

Thank you!

The Popcorn Time community experienced a similar, smaller scale assault by the MPAA a few years back.  It was a successful open source project that presented a Netflix-like interface to torrents.  The MPAA couldn't """"stop"""" an open source project, so they injected themselves into the community. They took over the main fork by getting injunctions and """"relaunching"""" the software, but now complete with IP loggers. They then would fork that project several times, and proceed to create a """"blame web"""" of accusations that one or more of the code forks are owned by the MPAA to track pirates, causing chaos.

As a result, they created doubt in the entire community whether to trust any Popcorn Time clients at all.

https://web.archive.org/web/20160405011056im_/http://popcorntime.ag/images/overview-1.png

So now we are seeing a surge of consensus-breaking clients since the beginning of last year: Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Segwit2x, Bitcoin ABC. And Bitcoin Core is being blamed as if it were a centralized corporate entity """"for profit"""" instead of a decentralized open source project that is very political in its nature. These altclients are most likely backed by a large entity such as a banking cartel or state sponsorship, with the goal to divide, conquer and control Bitcoin.  

Bitcoin's security comes from the lack of ability to quickly change or duress the network.  **No altcoin/fork of Bitcoin can say that they truly work as a decentralized exchange of value.  Bitcoin is  the still the only """"bitcoin"""" and always will be** 

The assault's goal that we are experiencing is to make the community feel they need to change quickly, with the result of several possible chainsplits and that will ultimately cause chaos, confusion and doubt.

**Bitcoin works as it is today, without changes. We need to be skeptical about actors advocating quick change and/or FUD claims of bitcoin being overtaken by one of the less """"political"""" altcoins of Bitcoin.**  Bitcoin it political by design, and that's what makes it work.

I am somewhat skeptical of the quickness of BIP148 as well, because it fits in this same narrative that a choice needs to be made now.  BIP149 seems to be the superior proposal, but I'm not against BIP148 if I felt it were widely supported.  However, Segwit2x seems to have overshadowed the conversation (by design).  This client is simply Bitcoin XT v4.

Therefore, I'm inclined to support UASF by BIP148 because of Segwit2x's effectiveness."

Any suggestions?"
2029,"I recently got into an argument with someone spewing referral links and touting Genesis (and BitConnect, smh) so I decided to run the numbers the best I could for his situation.

**tl;dr** You will have a return of investment of -38.6% (yes, negative) before your contract is cancelled because of increased network difficulty.


**Methodology**

* I'm ignoring price fluctuations in BTC. I'm assuming that it doesn't drop enough to invalidate the contract. This is a very important point because a lot of people use this in their argument, but there's no reason you need to mine for this, you can just buy and HODL.
* I'm using CoinWarz for the profitability calculator, and I'm using the upfront contract cost as hardware cost (it's a one time capital expense), and distribute the maintenance fee as an electricity cost - shown more clearly later.
* I assume that network difficulty doubles every 6 months. This is based on looking at BitcoinWisdom. I haven't been able to find a better/more precise indicator, but if this is relatively close it makes the math very convenient.
* I'm using an average over time. If a value changes linearly over time (network difficulty) and you know the values of the endpoints, you can say that the value of the each individual point in that time period is the average between the endpoints. More illustratively, if I am earning $1/day today, and I believe I will be earning $0.50/day in one year, I can say that on average my earnings over the next year are $0.75/day.


**The Numbers**

I started w/ 16.5 TH/s because that is how much the other person said he had.
At today's rates, it costs $2,175 to buy 16.5TH/s.
Maintenance rate is $0.00028/GHs, so maintenance fee is $4.62 fee per day or $0.1925/hr.
I inputted this CoinWarz calculator w/ the $2,175 as the hardware costs, I used power and power costs of 192.5 Watts and $0.001/Wh, which equals the same $0.1925/hr maintenance fee

*Initial (read: the one Genesis wants you to look at but is actually misleading) verdict:* 228 days to break even.
**NOTE:** this is really important because some people seem to forget this. An investment in Genesis cannot be withdrawn. It's money gone. So after 228 days you haven't doubled your money or even earned $2,175, you have $0. You spent $2,175 and then you got it back. $0 total. 

Now, stepping it up, I introduce the effect of network difficulty. From my methodology, we assume that the difficulty doubles every six months. That means that you're making (after maintenance fee) the full $9.54/day on day one, but at month six it's $2.46. **Wait a minute, that's not half!!** I made this mistake too! Of the initial $9.54, you're earning $14.16 but paying a maintenance fee of $4.62 - so after network difficulty doubles you earn $7.08/day but still have to pay the same $4.62 maintenance fee (your Gemini contract includes nothing about them ever having to provide a better maintenance fee ever). 

The network difficulty continues to increase and around the 9 month mark (to be precise, once network difficulty increases 3.065 times or day 280 of your contract) you're earning $4.62/day and your maintenance fee is $4.62 and imminently your contract is cancelled. You've hit the end of the road. 

Based on the virtues of linearity, if you're earning $9.54/day on day 1 and $0/day on day $280. Thus you're earning an average  $4.77/day over 280 days for a total of $1,335.60, **which is a net loss of $839.40 or a return of -38.6% on your initial $2,175.**


**Conclusion**

You will not make money with Genesis. You will lose money, a lot. The only way to make money is through referral links. That makes Genesis an MLM scheme. "

Does it count 336 blocks from the first BIP91 block and then sees that it has to have 80% within that 336 block timefram, starting over from 0 when 336 block have been mined?

Or is it 80% of the last 336 blocks and does it just roll over if the 80% is not met counted from the first BIP91 block?

336 blocks take about 56 hours to be found, right? So if BIP91 is not locked in before the 28th of July this could become important, no?

Thanks for any helpful info"
2051,"Admittedly I have gotten a little fed up with it as well as times.  But just remember that it is *supposed* to be this difficult and it *should* be.  The harder it is, the more distributed and diverse the network is.  We all have different visions of what Bitcoin is and how it is going to change the world.  To come to an agreement about significant changes at the core level, *even* if it's a soft fork, it will inevitably, by its nature, be a difficult and arduous process of **having to convince people of your argument, and prove to them the reliability of the code.** It is proof of a widely distributed power structure within the ecosystem. And it is proof that no one is able to simply force a change onto other players. 

Had SegWit actually been dangerous, unsecure, and risky code, then BIP148 would have been a joke.  1000 nodes wouldn't have done anything except fork to their own coin.  But *specifically because* SegWit was clearly safe code that presented multiple improvements, BIP148 simply became the excuse to finally make a decision.  But make no mistake, BIP148 success is not exactly what this activation demonstrates.  It is a better demonstration of the networks tendency toward extensive debate and testing in the face of controversial code, the process of broad decentralized consensus, and conservatism in the face of uncertainty.

TL;DR This entire process has doubled my confidence in Bitcoin as a secure, long term financial network that is going to completely change the nature of money, trade, and governance across the entire planet.  You thought the internet had an impact in the last 20 years?  You haven't seen *anything* yet."

2058,"An interesting aspect with BitcoinCash (Bitmains hardforking altcoin) is that users who want to split their coins and exchange them might be vulnerable to chain analysis companies when not taking a lot of care.   

One typical issue is coin-merge: 
You use Bitcoins tx outputs as inputs for a larger tx sent to an exchange or coin split service and reveal that you are the owner of all those tx outputs.    
If you use a KYCed exchange your full identity is connected to those tx outputs.  
But even if you exchange on Bisq where your privacy is much better protected there are some risks due the privacy flaws of Bloomfiters in BitcoinJ's SPV implementation (see: https://bisq.io/blog/privacy-in-bitsquare).  
Most users are not aware that all BitcoinJ based wallets comes with that privacy flaw. If using company/server based wallets you should not count with much privacy anyway.   
For highly technical users those problems can be controlled but not for 99% of the less skilled Bitcoin users. So the chain analysis companies will love that.

It is really questionable for me if we should add BitcoinCash as Altcoin regarding that background.   

Another reason to consider it that there will be probably no working replay protection in place, so there might be considerable risks involved.  

Beside that Bitcoin Cash is not just another Altcoin but could set a precedent if even slightly successful (what I highly doubt). Do we want that it becomes a fashion to hijack the Bitcoin network and instead of cleanly fork as an Altcoin try to fork off from the existing Bitcoin network? I doubt anyone want to see that.   

I tend that exchanges should rather boycott BitcoinCash as an un-ethical, technically risky and privacy damaging adventure.

2062,"Just my opinion.

It was playing out in my head like a game of 4D chess until I sat back and thought about it and realized there's nothing complicated or unreasonable about the idea. I think the majority of you, and many people currently day/week/month trading BTC are being played. The reason for instability is not uncertainty of the future, it's the fact that thousands of inexperienced traders have access to an easily traded asset with no barriers to entry and they're all reacting to every blip, every tweet, every Reddit post, etc. etc.

The average individual trading or investing in such a volatile asset is being drained of equity and has been for years and nobody seems to realize it yet. Exchanges are taking advantage of you. Mining pools are taking advantage of you. Roger Ver and everybody you bash is taking advantage of you.

And it has been infinitely worse this past month.

All the hype leading to every 'deadline', all the FUD.. Every single fluctuation in Bitcoin over the past month has been the result of actions from a select few individuals and exchanges. Whether Roger Ver &amp; company believe BCC will succeed or not, do you believe they're not playing and riding BTC straight to the bank? BTC-e goes down for maintenance (according to their Twitter) while someone else is shuffling around massive amounts of Bitcoin and suddenly, the masses panic and BTC dips twists and dives for a few hours. Massive numbers of spammy transactions show up in the mempool and people blame it on someone trying to send a message, all the while the collective mining pools are collecting 20-30 times more fees from you than they normally would.

The mistake is believing that everybody using Bitcoin is getting tossed around the same way in the chaos. Someone tried to tell me earlier that nobody is winning with such a chaotic market.. Just remember that experienced traders learned to profit from chaos long before anybody alive today was born. Bitcoin is no exception to the rule."

2064,"Bitcoin Cash (BCC), a new digital asset, will be deployed at 12:20 PM (UTC) on Tuesday, August 1st, through a hard fork of the bitcoin network. 

The fork will likely cause disruptions in the bitcoin network. As a result, to protect customer funds, BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals starting at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, July 31st. 

We will give all BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay customers BCC amounts equivalent to the BTC that they have in their accounts at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Tuesday, August 1st, 2017. 

After BCC is distributed to customers:

1. BTCC DAX customers will be able to view their BCC assets under """"Balance."""" https://dax.btcc.com/userbalance 

2. BTCC USD Exchange customers will be able to view their BCC assets under """"Overview"""" in """"Account."""" https://exchange.btcc.com/account/overview

3. JustPay customers will be able to view their BCC assets in """"Asset Overview"""" on BTCChina's Blockchain+ trading platform. https://plus.btcchina.com

4. BTCC DAX and USD Exchange customers will be able to withdraw their BCC assets; BTCC DAX and USD Exchange will not support BCC trading for the time being. We will inform customers when they will be able to withdraw their BCC from BTCC DAX and USD Exchange. 

5. BTCC JustPay customers will be able to trade BCC/CNY on BTCChina's Blockchain+ trading platform. Blockchain+ will not support BCC deposits or withdrawals in the short term; this position will be reconsidered based on the stability and maturity of the BCC network. 

6. BTCC reserves the right to suspend or stop BCC withdrawals based on market conditions.

Please note that BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, July 31st ahead of the hard fork. We will let customers know when deposits and withdrawals resume; we will aim to resume deposits and withdrawals as soon as possible after the hard fork.

Customers may find that BTC transfer confirmations are slow or that transactions are not confirmed around the time that the hard fork occurs. BTCC will strive to process customers' bitcoin transfers as quickly as possible, but whether or not bitcoin transfers are confirmed will depend on the stability of the bitcoin network after the hard fork. As such, BTCC cannot guarantee that bitcoin deposits to customers’ accounts after we suspend deposits at 4:00 AM (UTC) on Monday, July 31st will be promptly credited to the relevant accounts. We also cannot guarantee that customers will receive BCC for BTC deposited to BTCC DAX, USD Exchange, and JustPay after 4:00 AM (UTC) on July 31st.

2072,"I just think that a spam transaction attack can easily destroy Viabtc BCH chain. The reason is that this chain will have a very small hashrate, it need many days for the difficulty correction and until then their chain will be stuck.
A malicious person can begin to spam attack this chain and fill the mempool with a huge amount of transaction.
This will be a disaster cocktail and i dont think this small chain can handle the amount of work that need to clear the mempool.
Of course this attack can happen only from a big bitcoin holder."

2074,"Here's the beginning of the relevant part of the interview:

https://youtu.be/v0Ujt0R6qko?t=10m36s

... Being completely new to Bitcoin, and knowing that I haven't ever cared about what websites I've been to in the past, I'm now terrified that I've put Bitcoin into a cell phone wallet.

If I move them to one of those external wallet things, or into a paper wallet, will this prevent any sort of hacker from getting them in the future? or am I perma-fucked?"

2077,"So as the title says, I had a new core HD wallet that had just received some BTC. I went to back it up, but wanted to set the password. After running the `bitcoin-cli encryptwallet` command, I saw with horror that the HD seed had been reset. (Note that nowhere in the docs for the command, which I read beforehand, does it say anything about clearing the HD seed...)

Is there any chance I can recover this? Is there anything that would identify the file when trying to `grep` the drive directly? (It's on an ext4 file system)"
2078,"Safe?
Reliable?

Thank you."

2080,"A new website has popped up called microhash.net and most people have already concluded it'd a scam. I am 99.9% certain it's a ponzi based on one simple note from them. You get 10 KH/s of mining for free and therefore a few cents per day in satoshis. But if you look at the requirements to withdraw your """"free"""" satoshis, """"You must first buy hashpower to withdraw bitcoins. Alternatively, you must invite a user who made a deposit!""""

That's enough for me to conclude it's a ponzi/scam."
2081,"By the next halving (a little less than 3 years from now) if Bitcoin doesn't get a lot more adoption, mining could risk not to be profitable anymore. Because the price won't raise enough while the mining cost will raise for sure.

But if their new altcoin would gain enough success in the market (they just need the exchange market), they would need not to invest a lot into new hardware and electricity to profit from mining because with reduced difficulty the actual hardware resources would be enough.

Since making Bitcoin gaining more adoption is a more difficult task, they would like to reduce Bitcoin mining cost. How can you do that if you have to compete with every other miner? You pull the 3 cups trick with only 2.

You make a new altcoin cloning Bitcoin, then you reduce the mining difficulty and then you try to switch the cups, so you would have Bitcoin but it would easier to mine."

2086,"Hey guys,

I'm seeking clarification. The market on Coinsquare has been up and down, it was showing BTC worth $23.19/1 BTC in CAD at 5:30PM EST today. It showed the market dipping low several times today, were these indeed flash crashes? I redeemed a $100 Flexepin voucher at 5:31PM and the market still shows BTC at this price. My amount purchased does not reflect what I thought it would do (I thought this meant a small window of opportunity to get 4 BTC, sort of the right time/right place kind of thing). Instead I have 0.02253584 BTC purchased. Even as I type this, CS website is showing BTC at $23.19 CAD per 1 BTC. 

I already filled out a support ticket but maybe I'm wrong about something. That was my first time redeeming a Flexepin voucher but it went through with no problems. I should note that the voucher does not redeem the $100 Flexepin voucher to Canadian dollars on the exchange, it notes that it instantly converts to BTC. Any help from the community would be great. 

"
2087,"[UPDATE] It looks like I messed up. Though I double checked at first, the triple check didn't show anything unusual. Probably the rows got misaligned when merging, and showed the wrong miner for the address. Sorry for the confusion, but, of course, anyone is welcome to quadruple check =) [/UPDATE]

All this talk about mining centralization got me curious, so I decided to do a little digging myself.

I got the list of reward addresses of all post-fork b money blocks from blockchair.com and cross-referenced it with the """"miner"""" column from coin.dance...

I found out a bunch of blocks (236 out of the 259 I looked) have common coinbase addresses shared between either bitcoin.com, ViaBTC or the """"Hennessy Road"""" miner. Am I mistaken in thinking that pools shouldn't share addresses? I've never followed mining before, and didn't do any pre-fork analysis. Has this always been the case? It is just very weird to me that different pools would send their block reward to the same address.

PS: if anyone is interested I can upload the excel sheet somewhere, but it's all super easy to put together."

So, I started buying Bitcoin when it was valued at around €850. I then bought some more at €1100.
I sold at €2400.
I bought at $1700
Sold at €2700
Bought €2400

So far, it's a nice chunk of profit over a period of about 3 months. Percentage-wise, it's massive. I didn't invest very much however.

I recently sold all at €2900 and change, thinking it would soon drop considerably.

BTC is valued at €3027 as of right now.

So here's a lesson for those getting into crypto: There is no """"peak value"""" to reach. Yes there are valleys and massive dips at times, but so far, BTC have consistently bounced back and gone even higher. I really have no idea where Bitcoin might peak, if indeed it ever will.

So i decided to jump on the Bitcoin train aswell but unfortunately too late and instead of 2400euro/btc I had to pay 2800euro/btc. At the moment I don't want to use any hardware wallet and therefore I had to create a wallet as secure as possible because otherwise I am always scared about virtual theft and I have too much to lose. I created a bootable USB drive and downloaded the newest tail from the official website, I verified the version through the firefox addon and furthermore through Kleopatra and some SHA-256 Hash (instruction from the internet) but I heard there are still ways to have downloaded a infected version through something called man in the middle attack, is that possible or am I just paranoid? After that I booted from the USB and had my WIFI turned off the whole time and created a standard wallet in Electrum, encrypted the persistent storage and Electrum and wrote down the seed words on paper. I created a watch only adress with the public key from Electrum to watch transactions. I already sent some amount to my public adresses and recieved them successfully but my balance on tails obviously shows 0 because it was never connected to the internet. What I want to know now is that how am I able to restore my wallet from any given computer if my seed words have been created offline and therefore have never been able to be sent to electrum servers? So how do I exactly verify that I own the coins without connecting my offline wallet to the internet?  Furthermore I wanted to ask if my wallet is 99.99% safe from any virtual theft since my intentions are to hold btc for long term purposes? Also in order to satisfy my mind that I will always be the owner of my btc I need to know what will happen if Electrum somehow vanishes and all the servers are shutdown how will I be able to restore my wallet from the seeds because no other program except Electrum would accept those seed words and only if they have been transmitted to the internet before, right ? So basically I need to understand the concept about the way I actually stored my bitcoins and if it is safe enough for 5-10 years from virtual theft or any problems that might occur if electrum servers are shut down? 
I would highly appreciate any help and sorry for my bad English in terms of the technical explaining but I am from Germany."

Price worshipers, why are you here? Mash F5 on the charts for anyone else cares, but I like to think the bulk of us are here for a distilled reading of current events surrounding material news and discussion and not roller coaster memes, or anecdotes on turning the future of finance back into fiat. 

Are you here because of the fundamentals of the technology and the disruption it will make on society and governments? or are you a trader in for a quick fiat buck? No judgement on the latter, but for fucks sake take it over to /r/BitcoinMarkets 

If you believe in the technology and relevant discussion, the current price doesn't matter because not only are we are a VERY LONG way from mass-adoption, but because price is not a measure of adoption either. Bitcoin is a binary story, literally and figuratively, if it succeeds its fiat equivalent is immaterial because fiat will be effectively dead.

Just realize, that every time you make a big deal about Bitcoin's price relative to obsolete and immoral fiat, you undermine the principles it was built upon. Shit happens, we still live in a fiat world, so if you need to convert... try to keep it in the bitcoin economy and not money-services-businesses... and don't brag about your failure as a **hold**er.

2114,"We've all heard that doing a Brain Wallet is a bad idea and I should probably just use Warp Wallet and be done with it, however I was trying to think of a way to hold multiple wallets in my brain without too much work and came up with an idea I'm hoping someone with a deeper knowledge of cryptography can tell me not to do.

My idea would be a brain vault in the sense I could easily remember how to get the keys to say, 10+ accounts. It would also allow me to """"back up"""" my accounts to a safe deposit box in such a way that even if the government could take those paper backups they could never seize the bitcoin from them. In a way, this system would be like an HD brain wallet, so here goes:

My brain vault would be something like:

""""Today, I'm going to store my Bitcoin in:""""
(This I would keep in my mind as the """"Vault Phrase"""")
 
Then I would remember (and back-up to a safe deposit box) the countries in which I've """"Stored"""" my bitcoins. Next I would choose a country, let's say Germany. So Germany is in a list in my bank with a number next to it in the safe-deposit box, but it's also something I can easily remember without the bank, It's such a basic piece of information I can simply put it up on Google Docs as well with the amounts, these have each become separate accounts I can retrieve simply. What I would do next was SHA-256 both my code phrase as well as my code word so I would have my vault-phrase as:

""""Today I'm going to store my Bitcoin in:""""
SHA'd: 5cca96a6abc26effebd53412edd7bf1a39e6a4da421b6497fa458eb77912376b

""""Germany""""
80db4ccdca106d37b920206331fcfe3e9e50a9e763d89b54ce3ad5ac8cf30f03

Finally, I'd assemble the two (which is easy to remember to do since one naturally follows the next) in some scheme such as:

""""5cca96a6abc26effebd53412edd7bf1a39e6a4da421b6497fa458eb77912376b+80db4ccdca106d37b920206331fcfe3e9e50a9e763d89b54ce3ad5ac8cf30f03"""" 

this string would then be SHA-256'd to a final:
e6a325c430dcab9af196edcda30501d5e4aa53dda82dd08c7e5ca7340423bb67 

which (through familiar means over at bitaddress) finally becomes our """"German"""" account. 1D2NXX1mJcLUmwdRAihjdfQ6jP9ZdRHUvh

This system could be implemented using a Question and Answer scheme as well. With the Vault-Phrase: """"Who's got my Bitcoin?"""" and answers being family or friend's names. The overall idea is that one is manually creating a salt and pairing it with simple passwords that serve as a two-factor method of backing up stuff.

Ok, I'm ready for you all to tell me to shut up and go buy a Ledger-Nano. But cryptographically speaking, could someone explain why it's a bad idea? Or was it possibly an """"ok"""" idea but I just spoiled it by saying it online?"
2115,"With two versions in place and the others current difficulty being so low, a lot of miners have switched over to mine it from BTC. But with so many miners switching, it will lower the difficulty on BTC in a few days. This in turn will attract the miners back for the decreased difficulty. I believe we will see this jumping back and forth trend a lot with two competing sha265 algorithms. I know of a few crypto coins that have implemented a nice fix for the jumping around and prevented this kind of profiteering. Perhaps a difficulty adjustment every block will stop the jumping around. What do you guys think? What kind of problems might there be? Or is it even doable? Any other ideas?"

2118,"So I have been reading up and cant find this answer. Hopefully someone can help me. 

First question. Can I do an atomic swap as a single person? Do I NEED to find someone with an altcoin wanting Bitcoin or can I send my Bitcoin into the void and simply receive back my alt coin of choice?

Second Question which is more towards the thread title is this. I'm just wondering if, when other Segwit Atomic swap coins come into play, will that potentially surge prices back and forth until the overall value of those coins find its level like water. With Bitcoin being around 70B Market Cap and Litecoin being a 2B market cap, will Bitcoin go down to 35B and Litecoin go up to 35B?

Im glad it wasn't more but this sure is a wake up call. Not sure if it was Airbitz or the network itself, I know the miners and segwit have just started and are causing issues, but for anyone reading this, double check your fee before sending, I just lost about $282 over a super tiny transaction.

[Continuation of Moore's Law for x-years, battery development, new interfaces...?] Surely this falls closer towards decentralisation ideals founded by Satoshi and brings power away from centralised mining groups ~reduces the magnitude of threat posed by hard forks sponsored by miners/governments to weaken the 'bitcoin brand' and spread FUD.

-&gt; I'm talking about; a person who is not a trader, and doesn't understand blockchain technology goes into the AppStore on their mobile device and downloads the mining-pool app. This person then either starts their own pool with friends setting their own reward scheme which grows or joins somebody else's. Exponential increase of small-time miners on multiple apps on multiple systems. 

Coinbase seems to have an advantage as an exchange because of its simple user interface and it's accessibility to non-tech-savvy &amp; non-market/trading-savvy users. This simplicity could be introduced into mining to bring it to the layman.

2140,"**Leading Chinese exchanges have been accused of using customer funds to make high-risk private investments, Xinhua News Agency has reported.**

Xinhua alleges that Huobi and Okcoin collectively invested approximately 1b yuan ($150 m USD) into “wealth-management products”, citing recent investigations made into the activities of cryptocurrency exchanges by the People’s Bank of China.
 
**Okcoin has issued a statement refuting the allegations, stating “we at OKCoin have a strict policy of placing idle client funds into lower-risk banking products.** This policy is in keeping with general practices in the banking and securities industry, for both the purpose of safeguarding clients funds.” Huobi is yet to issue a statement regarding the allegations.

Xinhua has since published an editorial piece advocating for greater government regulation in the face of increasing dynamism within the cryptocurrency sphere. “New things are developing so fast that regulations must keep pace,” Xinhuan states, before expounding that authorities go to greater lengths to shut down bitcoin exchanges suspected of “dubious” operations.
 
Ascertaining the validity of Xinhua’s claims has become difficult due to the absence of further documentation supporting the allegations. Western media has been unable to access a key People’s Bank of China report cited in the article, and further details regarding the investment products that hosted clients funds are unavailable.
 
Beijing-based bitcoin exchange employees have revealed that cryptocurrency exchanges have become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny following the People’s Bank of China’s crackdown on leading cryptocurrency exchanges, included mandatory reporting to China’s central bank.

Or does the device some how know those addresses are used and automatically recover them when I use the seed?

In my situation I'm specifically talking about a keepkey. I've wanted to make sure I completely understand how the device functions before I transfer over too much. I've been able to wipe it and recover with a single asset / wallet, but after transferring other assets on I realized I didn't really understand how the seed recovered multiple addresses and wanted to make sure I did before trying recovery with more assets / $$$ involved. Maybe I'm just an idiot, but have been having a hell of a time finding a straight answer to how this all works using google."
2142,"Purchased a little over a whole one yesterday. Now I'm part of the revolution. Better late than never, right? "
2143,"The fact that Bitcoin is entirely open sourced, community managed, zero room for government interference and more control overall is truly amazing. 

However, the one thing I cannot get passed is the fact that it feels like a gamble. With the recent Bitcoin dip, it seems as though it's possible to just wake up one day losing 10% of your money.

Some say that it's meant to be that way, that it's comparable to a stock with the possibility of a loss, but you don't use stocks as a currency for day to day purchases. What are your thoughts on this? Perhaps some of you could soothe my worries."
2144,"Hi everyone!

Today i went to a market room in a very famous bank ( sorry can't disclose the name), and I had a talk with equity and foreign exchange traders about bitcoin.

First they all knew about it, which is a great beginning.  they all did research, like what is mining, where do coins come from, what is the algorithm behind, the pros/cons....

As I was trying to explain them that the bitcoin community was using bitcoin as a hedge, and compared it to """"gold"""" they all laugh! 
They pulled out a volatility index and BTC/usd graph. They also explained me that a currency that is that volatile was not viable for commercial use ( I totally get it, how can a merchant make sur the currency won't take a 10~12% dive while the transaction is being processed). 

Then I tried to explain that is was great to send money across the world with low fees, once again they showed me the graph and how it would affect everyone one ( sender/ receiver if the value dropped). And how ridiculous fees could get ( yes praise segwit).

I also showed them other crypto more stable like litecoin, but as soon as they understood it they told me the value of the it was based on the bitcoin, which is kind of true. And therefore not stable. How a merchant could fix a price if the value keeps fluctuate?

Also they are concern about privacy, why would you like to be anonymous, like what is the point, they showed me a dropped in bitcoin after silkroad was shutdown. ( they didn't mention terrorism!!)

In the end we conclude the discussion by mentioning that some banks were already trying to offer their own crypto to their clients, to which I respond, that we would not be able to control the supply and they could cheat us by supplying more than what they told. They kind of agree..

We then ended up in a discussion that was about : """"if crypto take over  fiat """" : 
lending money ( to buy a house for example) would not be possible anymore,  the banking system will die. 
The reasoning is that we cannot sell bitcoin if we don't have some ( like if you short a stock) so bank won't be able to provide loan, which will be terrible for the economy.

If you have any feedback or questions, or want more details about a point that is mentioned here I would be glad to answer it.

If your questions/explaination is relevant I'll try to ask them next week and get their pov on it

Hope you have a different approach of bitcoin now.


By the way they are all trying to short bitcoin as they think it will be worth between 1.600-2.200 in late december 2017

Tldr: """"traders are still unsure that bitcoin will be a relevant money in the future, but they really appreciate the blockchain and how it will allow to store sensitive data and replace old bulky server to secure information"""""

2146,"Hi everyone so i'm new to bitcoin and I just started a wallet on Electrum. I sent my bitcoin to it from coinbase and on my coinbase profile and after awhile it is still saying pending. However, on my Electrum wallet it looks like it was sent smoothly. Am i missing something?"
2147,"I took the plunge yesterday and bought my first Bitcoin from an ATM in town. Only $25 to start but I plan to buy on a regular basis from now on since my savings account hasn't moved in years.

I told my family over dinner I did something revolutionary, and my step-father scoffed and said it's dangerous as it isn't backed by anything, unlike money which is backed by gold. I responded by saying we've been off the gold standard since 1973 (US removed it in 1971, the rest of the world followed).  I sent him [this video](https://youtu.be/GNo7MDN5-0g) from Extra History, this was his response:

""""Thanks. But ... Bitcoin is not a currency. It's an asset. While currencies are no longer backed by the gold standard, they are backed by something tangible: their country's economic output., made up of goods and services. Bitcoin is not only virtual, it's finite, at 21 million units. Given the very fact that its value is based on perception, it is inherently unstable. It must be. A better analogy for Bitcoin is a company's shares, of which there is usually a finite amount. The value of those shares fluctuates, sometimes wildly, according to public perception of their worth. Shares are an asset, not a currency.""""

I was going to respond with this:

""""Currency is defined as a system of money in general use in a particular country. Unlike shares, I can spend my bitcoin at shops in my country and/or online. That it is digital doesn't matter.

It's a tradable asset and like any other tradable asset it has volatility issues, but so do currencies backed by countries with economic output. Look at 1923 Germany, Nigeria last century and now Venezuela. I admit Bitcoin is more volatile but it's no different than any other currency that can be influenced by public perception. It is backed by economic output, it's just not centralised in one country. Instead data miners around the world are creating that value by using computer power rather than manpower. Bitcoin's market capitilsation is currently standing at USD$72 Billion.

The finite amount of Bitcoin is like any other currency too. There is a finite amount of gold and a finite amount of money in the world. However gold prices can be influenced by gold rushes which sends gold prices plummeting. Rampant money printing can cause huge inflation in local economies. On the other hand Bitcoin becomes harder to 'mine' as more miners join the network. Only 1/3 of those 21 million units have been mined and once the mining is over that Bitcoin will still exist while miners can migrate to other cryptocurrencies. I only spent USD$25 yesterday and received 0.005 of a Bitcoin. You don't have to own a whole Bitcoin to own some, just like you don't need to carry $100 notes everywhere.""""

I don't want to give him a wall of text to read, this is as succinct as I can make it, unless my points are incorrect or can be removed/changed? He's an intelligent guy but he's prone to being very stubborn unless facts are presented that show otherwise. Your input would be appreciated."

2158,"With it's decentralized ledger and world-wide access, Bitcoin is not only an interesting investment, but it is also undermining every financial &amp; political system on earth that requires us to trust a central entity to keep a record, and to speak that record back to the public for proof or decision making. Here are the things we spoke about at our round table - they give me some hope for the future that didn't exist in a real way before bitcoin.

- The need for real life banks is gone, they can exist for other useful/different reasons, but everyday large scale transactions and most daily personal banking needs, and generally financial security are all no longer bank dependent (nor credit card/website dependent).. Just this alone could really change a lot. If all the resources and money lost to huge salaries, """"legal corruption"""", along with a now very archaic infrastructure (right down to air-conditioned skyscrapers) and untrained staff, were all translated into savings for the common user, the world market would be very different. The amounts of profit that banks make alone is staggering. At least in the billions per bank per year in 1st world countries. Then there is the fraud... Our personal estimates of 10s of trillions of dollars saved over short amounts of times (a few years) seemed almost conservative when taking everything into consideration. 

- War resistant money! Bitcoin means that people can flee their homeland, leave their home and everything they have, get to some other safe place, use an airport internet hotspot and access their entire life savings without interruption. Also, as a whole, the public money is safe, even if taken over completely, when the military takes over, when the religious wars are waged, no money will necessarily be at risk. We wondered, if wars could not be funded by robbing the country being invaded, could they be fully paid for by taking natural resources and land alone? We weren't sure, but it would take out a big bite. There were so many different little reasons we came up with around war, but I'll move on.

- Voting. No need to dwell on this one, obviously voting and fraud is a big conversation these days. A blockchain based voting system is surely going to shed some light on the true opinions of the nation. We were not so sure if this would be a big deal or not, but we decided its best to be sure fraud is dealt with at this level of decision making. But also, since voting could potentially be in your hands, on a phone or device, maybe we vote together on some of the simpler decisions, it could deflate the pressure on higher levels of govt to make these decisions, maybe they could spend some time on important things etc... Why spend so much time discussing things in govt when we could know the exact sentiments of the entire country very quickly and cheaply. This blockchain tech doesn't exist yet so I'll leave it alone. 

- Immutable history. I mean, this is the first time there is the potential for human history to be recorded in a verifiable way. We could actually be able to all agree on what happened and how it happened because there is a decentralized ledger. If one pays close attention to how much merit and importance we put into history and how things went...With modern education there is a constant need to show you how to feel about the world, why we are the good ones &amp; who is bad. The internet feeds this desire to new heights of addiction. A blockchain of events, not only financial but of all events could change our relationships worldwide.

I know some of these things are blockchain based ideas, I personally believe the bitcoin blockchain is capable of doing all of these things in some way, or at least the network could power &amp; secure these types of tech. Being the one largest, most secure, immutable ledgers on earth with no central authority, there is a reason to continue on with Bitcoin as the main blockchain. These few things I mentioned above are just a small example of the earth-changing things that Bitcoin is capable of, we have only scratched the surface."

I am disappointed how people are not understanding the human crime that the Chinese government is committing.

Where is our solidarity with the Chinese? Today is them, tomorrow will be us. Most people are not understanding the depth of the Chinese government's attitude.

2173,"Although I imagine that this is potentially an overall net positive for the bitcoin and crypto space, I am concerned about Wall Street's ability to begin substantially manipulating the prices of BTC and the crypto market at large. When considering that there is only so many BTC in existence, I would think that this influence will be limited and that they will only contribute to Bitcoin's overall rise.  Unfortunately there's  two main problems that I see here. 1) Wall Street is run by banks (BTC competition) and  2) Wall Street has been known to manipulate all kinds of markets.. ie.  naked shorting.  Considering that Bitcoins natural enemies are seemingly closer than ever to directly participating in our market with unlimited fiat resources, I would hope that the community has some kind of plan to be able to keep track of their purchases / sells. I believe that as a community we need to keep tabs (to the extent possible anyway) on how much crypto is held by these organizations so that at any time we know the true extent of their influence on the crypto markets. Is anyone out there familiar with any projects which are running now or being set up to monitor this kind of information?  If not then hopefully this post can spark some interest in the community to consider the benefits of such a program.  At the end of the day I believe that most of the larger holders of BTC aren't budging with their coins and see it as the potential future reserve currency.  However we're still years away from that and in the meantime these financial powerhouses can do a lot of damage to the natural evolution if we're not careful. Any thoughts and comments are much appreciated!"

Imo will create an economical mess with an everyday trading between the three chains(BCASH is also here :P )   
Especially it will create a hashrate mess between this 3 chains. Miners will swing from one chain to other to follow the most profitable chain.  
It will create and a huge mess to their customer support. The NYA startups will need to scale their support service x10 to handle this situation.  
For that reason everyone must relax and let this mess happen and  watch this guys to built their own doomstone.

One of the best ways to disseminate information is through the marketplace, and Bitfinex's chain split token enables this to happen before the actual split in November so that there can be a KYC vote where people can weigh their vote with their Bitcoins. This is absolutely amazing and an important step towards determining which chain has actual community consensus.

Perhaps one thing to worry about is whether or not these markets will be manipulated by either side. Not sure if there's a solution to that yet.

Currently, the incumbant chain is trading at about 3x the SegWit2X chain."

2213,"I was using coinbase and they banned my account after years of service without specifying a reason why and being rather rude to me in the email threads that preceeded. 

I have had a very hard time finding an alternative provider in my state that doesn't have absolutely astronomical fees for both buying and selling that make it very unfeasible compared to what i used to pay. 

It astounds me that there is not another decent competitor in this field. 

If there is a site where I can legitimately convert some fiat to crypto without having to go through a god damn root canal - please recommend here.  

Cex.io - not serviced where i am
bitfinex - temporarily halting accepting USD wire deposits 
many other smaller named ones - tell me to fuck off because i'm from the USA or from the state that I am in in the USA. 

also, most of these services make you go through the trouble of making an account before they actually tell you services are not provided, which is the biggest most fucking annoying thing in the world.

2225,"Bitcoin may be in for a sustained record run as it overcomes key obstacles, experts said Thursday after the cryptocurrency set a new record high.

Even bitcoin fans were plagued by doubts over the summer when Chinese regulators cracked down on exchanges trading the virtual currency and a dispute among developers gave birth to a new version, splitting the market of the budding currency.

In September, banking regulators in Beijing and Shanghai ordered local cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down.

But observers say they are now detecting a rethink by the Chinese authorities, causing bitcoin on Thursday to surge past the $5,000 level for the first time since its launch eight years ago.

Around 1530 GMT its value based on a basket of trading exchanges calculated by Bloomberg was $5,247.02, up from $4,829.29 late Wednesday.

This represents a rise of 400 percent this year alone."
2226,"Hey all, apologies for the newbie question, but maybe others will find it helpful as well.  

So, there's a probable fork coming up.  How do protect my coins during the turbulence?  If I've read about the past forks correctly and the method is the same then all I have to do is- keep my btc in a wallet (cold or hard) but off of an *exchange*.  Is that correct/true this time?  

Then, if I'm on an exchange, I'll have to do whatever that exchange decides to do.  In a wallet, things will unfurl however they do, but I'll still have btc, and afterwards I can decide to keep or move or whatever.  And at least in the first few days I'd be able to trade to whereever I wanted to go and price would be near parity for btc=$$$=&lt;new-fork-symbol-if-there-is-one&gt;.  Is that correct?

Even on an exchange though, I'd still have that ability, to move... but I might have to actually take that step to get back to btc if that happened.  On a wallet the (only) advantage is I'm confirmed to stay with btc.  Correct?

My goal is simply to avoid this thing I'm reading where a transaction would appear somehow on both blockchains simultaneously.  Which, honestly, I don't quite understand.  If anyone wanted to eli5 me on that, that'd be cool.  But the goal is really, to just protect myself.

Is the best way to store in a paper wallet or not?

2236,Would using Gemini to buy and sell around 2k worth of bitcoin throughout the day be worth it? I constantly notice my total bitcoin value fluctuating about 80$ throughout the day. Would it be smart to sell when I notice it at its high and buy when it drops back down?

Basically I have two virtual machines on the same os, one is offline and the other one is online.

2238,"Trying to sort out a macro perspective on the price of bch &amp; BTC leading into and after the fork.  

I noticed the gap with btc futures and btc has closed rapidly in the last 24 hours - what triggered this?
6 days ago I saw news f2pool retracted support and heard they have 15% hashing power
Lots of negative 2x press.  Every article I have come across recently.
Bch price went back up significantly when just a few days back I felt the consensus was that it may die out
With this in mind, It's looking like btc price is leveling off and will not break 6k prior to the fork.

Could you please share your opinions on these decelopments and enlighten me?"
2239,"Completely forgot I did this. Logged in, found a decent chunk of bitcoin. I don't know what this says about my ability to accurately monitor my spending if $200 was missing from my bank account every month, and I didn't notice. I also might have early onset dementia.  

I hate to think about the fact that I was essentially paying 4% fees on each of those transactions. "
2240,"I'd like to buy as much bitcoin as I can seeing as the price keeps going up, but I've also seen some predictions that it'll go down again fairly soon. Should I buy bitcoin today or would it be better to wait?"
2241,"So, a couple years ago I was pretty big into trading bitcoin and other cryptos. I had the metatrader enabled account with the 5:1 leverage and all the best niche technical indicators, price chart widgets on my phone set to update every minute, twitter feeds for all the good pump 'n dumps, all that. Actually paid my rent for a few months that way. And then at some point, life happened, and I had to cash out.

Just recently I finally became financially stable again. I went to reactivate all my old dormant accounts to make a conservative investment and hodl. Sad to see BTC-E gone, I loved those sketchy Russian freaks.

Anyway, I logged into coinbase, and lo and behold, I had a balance estimate of $57.03. It turns out that the $2.37 in change that I left in my account as BTC had appreciated in value, significantly, earning me a nice little bit of pocket change. That little moment really brightened my day.

I wanted to share this with you because I learned a very important life lesson when I was trading full time, and it's stuck with me to this day.

Be happy with the small wins.

It would be really easy for me to open that account up, see that $57.03, and think """"Man, if only I had hodl'd longer, I could be rolling in dough right now! I should have waited! This sucks!"""" 

I did a lot of pump and dumps. For those unfamiliar, a pump and dump is where a bunch of people all buy an obscure altcoin all at once to drive up the price, and then quickly unload it to capitalize on the short term gains. But, since most of the traders involved are the ones operating the pump and dump, in reality it's basically a ponzi scheme at supersonic speeds.

What I learned from those is that the people who make money on those are the people who buy in at the start, wait for the price to rise 5 or 10 percent, and then cash out. The ones who loose money are the ones sitting there, seeing they're 30% up, and being unsatisfied sit there waiting for 31%.

The lesson here is that greed ruins people. It causes people to make stupid trades. It makes people feel like shit when they buy in right before a dip, or obsessively execute dozens of trades trying to get the exact high point of the day.

Before I had $2.37. Now I have $57.03. That's a nice night out with my beautiful girlfriend, or a week's worth of groceries, or a water bill I don't have to worry about.

I could torture myself thinking about how of I had left $6 in there, it'd be $100. Or if I had left $100, it could be $2,500. But you know what? I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna be absolutely thankful that I got about $50 for doing absolutely nothing.


So, remember that guys. Little wins are still wins. Appreciate life, be thankful for what you have, hodl those coins, and don't let it bother you that you didn't buy in or cash out at the perfect moment."
2242,"I was in New York yesterday.  And in my small, one hundred square foot hotel room I drafted a new New York Agreement to replace the old one.

3. A year is now 360 days long

CEX.IO on Bitcoin Gold and SegWit2x

As SegWit2x approaches, we want to update you about the future changes and their impact on your operations on CEX.IO.

We always aim to provide our clients with convenient and secure service under the conditions of the highly changing market. And we will do our best to keep all operations on our platform running.

Bitcoin Gold (BTG)

As the Bitcoin Gold fork took place, we would like to inform you that you have received the new coins in an amount equal to the BTC on your balances at the moment of the hard fork.

The full node client is still not released by the development team of Bitcoin Gold, so we are waiting for it to check its security and ensure the safety of transactions. As soon as the BTG client will pass the tests for security, we will add the following pairs:

BTG/BTC
BTG/USD
BTG/EUR
BTG/GBP
The deposits and withdrawals of BTG will be enabled later.

Bitcoin SegWit2X (B2X)

After SegWit2X fork, we will split the coins and add the following pairs:

B2X/BTC
B2X/USD
B2X/EUR
B2X/GBP
Our users will receive new coins, and you will be additionally informed about the proportion. Deposits and withdrawals of B2X will be available later. And it is possible that we will stop withdrawal and deposit operations with BTC until we make sure they are secure.

In any case, do not worry because of the changes Bitcoin is overcoming. Whatever happens, we are going to act in the best interest of our clients, so don't hesitate to use CEX.IO for your benefit."

2271,"I'm a beginner in bitcoin, got interested in it and wanted to buy some without knowing much about it. Long story short I bought some and wanted to transfer coin I had to a different wallet for storage and trading on a different platform. Doing this naively without any idea of how bitcoin transactions actually work. I thought you were just moving money. Now I know every action is like a transaction on the Blockchain. 

The platform doing this for me did not mention anything about transaction fees but I now know it is essential to get your transaction confirmed in the Blockchain. It was something like 0.0007btc for a 0.0064 transaction. Now that is a ridiculously high transaction fee (in the opinion of someone who is just New to this). Something like $4 for a $37 transfer. 

I Guess I'm just wondering how or why would bitcoin become mainstream if transaction fees for simple transactions are so high? With all the hype around the technology being so efficient, I don't get how is this feasible for mainstream use with lower denominations? 

I know some places like Coinbase don't charge transaction fees. But still, that is just one address and the cost is still there. It is just that they absorb it. "

2274,"Alright, so one thing I don't understand about all these Bitcoin forks is the whole exchanges calling the new coin bitcoins if it has more hash power.

I believe one of the biggest components that helps give Bitcoin backing is that it can actually be used to purchase things, it actually has a value to it. For example, I can buy a game on steam with Bitcoin. Now let's say with one of these forks of Bitcoin, like bitcoin2x or whatever it is called. Lets say that the Chinese mining groups all decide to mine this new coin, effectively giving the new coin (b2x) 51% hash power.

So now all these exchanges start calling what was b2x, Bitcoin. So what happens to my old bit coin? Why in the hell would a new coin ever be called Bitcoin? 

Can I use this new bitcoin to purchase stuff at all the places I could purchase stuff before?

Also, I understand that Bitcoin is supposed to avoid the whole single point of control but how are we avoiding that when apparently the mining community can basically determine what coin is Bitcoin.

All this hard fork / Bitcoin being attacked is super weird to me. It seems like this is all more detrimental to Bitcoin than actually helping it."

Why?

* it's rarely, if ever used to buy legal goods (or accepted for that matter). 
* It is exceedingly volatile, way too volatile to be used as a method of exchange. 
* The extreme volatility also prevents it from being a store of wealth.

Think tulips....

So why don't Amazon take it for goods, they accept every other currency.

Simply put, it is not possible for a business to accept such a volatile pseudo-currency for goods, for obvious reasons.

An example, I buy $5,000 of Tech kit from Amazon paying 1BTC. Amazon might happily take it and IMMEDIATELY convert it to dollars and bank the dollars. Given it's volatility what else could they do (they are not pseudo-currency speculators).

Ok, deal done, you get to spend BTC for goods, they end up with dollars.

Now comes the reason why they could not accept such a volatile pseudo-currency.

You decide that you want a refund 5 days later.... what if BTC has risen by 20% in a few days. Amazon are proper screwed, and would not be able to refund you in dollars and would have to take a huge loss given the margins they trade on to refund you in BTC.

...and before you say it, if they did not convert it immediately to a stable currency, they leave themselves open to a huge loss if BTC tanks.

This is why Bitcoin will not be accepted until it is a stable pseudo-currency.

2283,"_The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'_

(Gordon Lightfoot, The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald)

Bitcoin's strength lately in the face of regulatory, cultural, criminal, and political challenges has been extraordinary. Nothing seems to faze it, not even the Chinese exchange shutdowns. And so we are celebrating another all-time high with Bitcoin seemingly invincible.

There are, however, the storm clouds on the horizon.

The NYA hardfork remains in place with no sign it will be abandoned despite the resounding rejection in multiple futures markets such that it is valued at only 15% of Bitcoin's current price. A few mining pools are not signaling for the NYA, but it remains solidly over 80% of hashrate and supporters are defiant.

The hardfork will have no replay protection in place, an extremely aggressive choice guaranteed to create risks of lost coins in the immediate aftermath of the fork. This will likely lead to headlines in crypto and general media with a very negative impact. 

Gemini, Coinbase and other major exchanges and services are signaling they may call the NYA fork """"Bitcoin"""" simply if the miners stay behind it. NYA strategists are exploring strategies to dominate the legacy Bitcoin fork with empty-block mining. This would prevent any transactions from taking place on the legacy chain (which might reduce replay attacks but still leaves us in rather a bad way). 

So if nothing changes (and the battle lines have remained fairly static now for weeks), we are about two weeks from an existential crisis hitting Bitcoin. How many new investors and old-time hodlers are paying attention? When the headlines announce the fork, followed by news of replay attacks how will they react? When exchanges start listing two different chains as """"Bitcoin"""" and the legacy Bitcoin chain grinds to a halt with zero transactions what will they do? When the NYA chain remains at current low levels while a wave of panic selling hammers the legacy chain, where will it end?

Show me why this won't happen. "

""""but, Late Stage Capitalism and failure of entire industries makes new endavours attractive.""""

Him - """"And they'll buy bitcoin meanwhile wealthy investors will suddenly sell up and everyone us fucked Unless some government bans it utterly""""

""""if governments ban it isn't it a good sign that they can't control it therefore it's subversing their power. they certianly aren't looking to protect the populace. they might claim banning it is for that reason but that's just a cover story.""""

This is why bitcoin is open source. Having a small development team susceptible to a buyout was never a problem because we could always hard fork it if they were compromised.

2295,"Regardless of what name the new chain is given if new users see 2 bitcoins on the app we are done.  That will be too confusing.  Segwit and blockchain is already hard enough to get but atlesat you can just buy bitcoin at first.

If new users open up coinbase for the first time and see more than one bitcoin we are screwed for a long time.  It will scare new money away.  And if new money goes away price will drop. Holders will sell and price will dive bomb.  People will freak out and sell and there will be millions and millions lost in what is supposed to be a new store of value.  Just because these companies want to support a rushed out pointless blocksize increase that divides the community and ostrizises the devs that made bitcoin what it is today.  The devs that had to fight for segwit for years.  We only just now got segwit through and we havent even seen the cool stuff it can do.  There is absolutely no reason to fork off now.  

On top of that to fork of and give the fork legitimacy on the number 1 on ramp for new customers is absolutely absurd.  There is gonna be major confusion.  And if that confusion causes major value loss than we are gonna see a long bear market again.

Mainly because we are allowing centralized organizations to have a major effect on a decentralized system.  

Coinbase listing this coin will screw us.  Regardless of what name its given.  

Maybe we need decentralized onramps so there isnt such a monopoly on entering this market right now for the average person.

Im not really sure what to do.  I just know for sure if you open up coinbase for the first time and see two different bitcoins because of such a dense history behind segwit your just going to give up.  Theres no way for the average person to make an informed decision and also go to work and hang out with family.  Understanding all this shit takes sooooooo long.  They will just stop buying"

Note than in Electrum I didn't check """"Replace by fee""""

Thank you!"

The guy I bought from was very unyielding so I ended up paying way more than it was worth in order for him to make the transaction. 


Completely no regrets, it was money I made during my job in summer and I wanted to take the risk. I knew about Bitcoin ever since the start, but I was too young to do anything myself.


By current calculations, I own 163 232.027 U.S. dollars at an age of 21. I am yet unsure what am I going to do with this, but certainly not sell. I doubt it has a real value, but I'm seeing different companies are starting to accept BTC as an option to shop. 


Funny thing about this all is that I completely forgot about Bitcoin since 2013 to recent 2017, ever since it passed 7K and I started following it again.

2364,"Officially just threw money away, is this how this works?"
2365,"It seems like people are buying bitcoin with the idea that it is more of an investment than a currency. With that notion, people will be reluctant to spend it, as who wants to spend bitcoin on something when it could be worth 100x more down the road. It's the same idea as gold. People HODL gold because of it's potential increase in value, not to use it to regularly buy things. For bitcoin to really transition into what it's meant to be, the masses will need willing to actually spend it, otherwise it will be a failure. Do you see the masses of people moving away from the idea of bitcoin as an investment and more of an actual currency?"

I told all my friends about BTC back in 2013, and I was buying heavily. They called it """"fake money"""" and """"tulips"""". Even when I showed I could cash out and put the cash back into the bank, they called it fake. I begged them then to get involved, and they wouldn't listen.

Now they are super angry, and somehow it's my fault. Well - F em."
2368,"OK so I'm not really new to crypto  , however I have never sold before (as crazy as that sounds) My question is when you sell on coinbase does the usd hit on your coinbase right away or is there a waiting period?

2369,"Like most of you here, I am working constantly to encourage my friends and love ones to allocate a portion of their non-essential funds to bitcoin/out of inflationary currencies such as the dollar. It’s going well for the most part but I will offer you a cautionary tale.

A retired friend lost 7 bitcoin to a scammer because his google search results returned a fraudulent number when he went searching for the Coinbase customer support number. I believe he searched for “Coinbase 800 number.” Being over 65 he just didn’t have the internet street smarts to recognize that the search results in this case were bogus (Are your loved ones any different?) The exceedingly patient gentlemen on the other end of the phone gently walked him through the process of inadvertently giving away all of his bitcoins which were in Coinbase. He even instructed him on getting his withdrawal limit raised in order to facilitate this.

I now discuss the Coinbase Vault anytime I mention Coinbase to a neophyte. I mention it twice to anyone who might not recognize red flags such as a “customer service agent” offering to remote login to your computer...

The Coinbase number begins with 888 not 1-800...

If anyone gets an answer on the fake number try and get audio of the guy and we can post it here for posterity."

My favourite quote was on LBC, what I consider to be a balanced and influential national radio station, from David Buik from Panmure Gordon.

He also said it’ll be 2-3 years before it overtakes the value of gold. Not sure exactly what that means, but I’ll take it as a positive. "
2371,"So, I'll just tell the general story. I mined in the early days (2011) and got myself a whopping 0.5 BTC. Didn't do anything with it because, well, it was fairly worthless. I stopped mining because the price to mine was not worth the pennies you earned.

Fast forward: I lost the wallet on my PC. Forgot about it mostly. But the recent spike made me want to give it one last go of looking for it.

Guess what. Found it on an old HDD with a windows backup on it. Well... found the wallet.dat file anyways. So now I'm installing the Bitcoin Core (former bitcoin qt that the wallet went to) so I can recover the wallet with value.

Ok... so now that that story is out of the way...

2374,"This is why we should all hope this calms down a bit. 

Holders don't want to sell. How can you blame them? Who wants to pay taxes now and sell at a lower price than in a few years when maybe taxes are gone because government power to collect has been reduced.

However the frog is about to scream and try to jump out of the deep fryer. Better to get to $100K a little slowly and boil the governments in big slow pots where they won't even notice.

2391,What are BTC futures exactly. Thanks in advance.
2392,"That's the gist of it. I'm hoping there’s some way to get into it by either finding the wallet seed, password, or the private key (I understand it's possible to recover a wallet with the private key, but I could be wrong). If anyone can point me in the right direction, please PM me. I found out over thanksgiving, and won’t be able to get back to work until the end of finals next week.

1)We guessed the user password to his macbook, which was his name. The macbook seems to have been set up a week before his passing.  The only items downloaded were TorBrowser, gnupgv2, electrum, teamviewer for remote access to his desktop, and a file labelled """"Key1"""" (a gnupgv2 public key). 

2) We were able to unlock his apple keychain and view everything within by inputting the user password, which included passwords as well as a bunch of """"key"""" objects, many with blank information fields. I do not know what these are. We were also able to unlock all of his Chrome passwords. 

3) The only wallet in the electrum directory is default_wallet.dat, which is password protected. None of the passwords I guessed open the wallet. I tried copying and pasting all passwords from Chrome and the apple keychain, but none of the open the wallet. (Does pasting a password invalidate the login attempt?) I might try using a bruteforce script based off of known passwords for other things.

4) We logged into his localbitcoin account, but the balance was zero, and the account has been inactive since last year. We also found a registration email for a coinbase account, but cannot access it because of the sms verification code (his phone number has been deactivated).

5) I learned that Macs have a """"hidden file"""" feature. I ran some command in the command line that revealed all hidden files, such as the gnupg and electrum directories. Inside the gnupg directory are some .gpg files (trustd, pubring, secring, pubring~). I also found a key.asc file in the search field. I understand that gnupg is an encryption client, though I think it may have been used to encrypt communication with dark net vendors. Is there a way that I can search for file on the mac that are encrypted? If so, how do I use what I have to decrypt said files, assuming I can? I have a feeling the password, seed phrase, or private key are somewhere inside an encrypted text file.

6) His iphone was wiped a while ago, but there is a backup in his iCloud. Is there anything there that might be useful?

7) Since we were unsuccessful at this point, we wanted to get into his desktop, since this is what he used the most. The windows login was known until he changed it shortly before passing. None of the Chrome passwords worked, nor any variations of his common passwords. The user account is not linked to a windows account, which is unfortunate because we have that login information. I understand that there are ways to crack the user login for an offline user account.

8) At this point I don't know if the mac was ever actually used to store BTC. I have a hunch that the default_wallet.dat is exactly that, the default wallet created when electrum was installed, and not something he ever actually used. I think the actual wallet is on the desktop.

9) Our most recent effort has been searching through his room to find the seed written down somewhere, or maybe a password. I found a slip of paper with what looks like four passwords written on it. These do not open default_wallet or the desktop. I also found a loose HDD that I haven’t looked at at the contents of, and a thumb drive with an fseventsd folder and some scripts (I think they were .bash or .py, I haven’t looked in a few weeks)

This is the information I have so far. I feel like much of it is tied together, but I am not familiar with electrum or encryption. He was big on privacy and took many steps to protect his own, but since I was able to get nearly every password of his by guessing his name, my gut feeling is that he slipped up somewhere else as well.
Again, If anybody can tell me what the things I found are used for and/or how they can be used to recover the wallet, please let me know. His parents could really use the money right now.

2393,"Article by [Jon Buck](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-less-environmental-impact-than-fiat-currencies) :

*The risks of environmental impact because of Bitcoin mining have been widely touted, but a recent report indicates that the actual damage from Bitcoin mining may well be far less than that associated with fiat currencies and other industries.*

*Data centers, gold mining and cash production all consume substantially more energy than Bitcoin mining.*

*The report indicates that the annual consumption of power from Bitcoin mining is 8.27 terawatt-hours per year, more than Ireland and other small nations. Nevertheless, this number is actually only an eighth of what data centers in the US consume annually, and the global production of fiat currencies stands at 11 terawatt-hours per year.*

*Gold mining burns a staggering 132 terawatt-hours per year. What’s more, these numbers don’t even include the massive amount spent on vaults, banks, security systems and more to keep the physical cash and precious metal safe.*

*FUD*
*The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining has been widely touted, particularly by those who believe it to be a non-legitimate currency, but it appears these accusations are more fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), rather than actual facts.*

*These reports do not take into consideration the actual costs of other types of value production, all of which consume resources. In point of fact, Bitcoin consumes less energy than its non-digital equivalents*

2396,"Hi all,

After hodling for a good while, I sold my coins when they hit 5,800 in order to pay down my student loans a bit (they're down to 80k - which is a pretty significant reduction). Obviously I shouldn't have sold at that point, but I really wanted to work through some of the debt I was carrying so I felt like I needed to pull the trigger.

My question is this: I have set aside an extra 350 each month to pay in addition to my actual payment in order to work through the loans - do you guys think I should stick with my current plan to pay down the loans or should I roll that 350 back into coin? The goal is really to pay down my debt as quickly as possible.

**Answer**: Yes... Two million.

*Caveat*: The argument potentially applies to any crypto, but in reality it will apply to the dominant crypto only. And if there's a few dominant ones, it can be adjusted appropriately. I think Bitcoin will be the dominant one, with perhaps a few smaller ones. Certainly not hundreds of them."

Hi @orange.fr,

For withdraw issues please makes sure to read this link: https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000233331-Where-is-my-withdraw-

An authorized status for a withdrawal means you have authorized your withdrawal and the system is working on sending it. In rare cases you may see an Authorized state for longer than expected. Please be patient, the withdrawal will still process, but may need extra time or manual interaction, which we perform throughout the day.

Comment je dois faire pour mettre à jour mon Portefeuille Ledger Nano S pour savoir qu'il est sur la bonne chaîne ? 
Comment je dois faire pour connaitre à qui appartient cette adresse si c'est pas la mienne ?

Pour vous ce n'est peut être pas un problème, mais je suis en panique total, je sais que vous n’êtes pas en faute, mais j'aimerais retrouver mes bitcoins ! c'est beaucoup d'argent pour moi et je ne veux pas les perdres.

Comment c'est possible de communiqué avec la personne qui à cette adresse ? est il possible de retrouvé d'ou vient cette adresse ?

How do I have to update my Ledger Nano S Wallet to know that it is on the right channel? 
How do I know who this address belongs to if it's not mine?

For you it may not be a problem, but I'm in total panic, I know you're not at fault, but I would like to find my bitcoins! it's a lot of money for me and I do not want to lose it.

How is it possible to communicate with the person at this address? is it possible to find where this address comes from?

Greeting.

Hi,

You will need to research how to properly sync your Ledger Nano S Wallet to make sure its on the correct block height. Bittrex does not own any Ledger wallets so you will need to research this.

Bittrex has know way to know who the address 1Gb25DmuY1wxSHYjHjogSLyFujKCUHYTYb belongs to as addresses do not have any information associated with them unfortunately. When sending coins to an address you always need to make sure you know exactly who the address belongs to before sending your coins to an address.

je ne comprend pas pourquoi !, est ce que si j'appel le FBI ou la police je pourrai avoir un soutien pour savoir à qui appartient cette adresse pour retrouver mes Bitcoins ?

I'm careful, I always send to my address Ledger Nano S, I always do the same way! 
I do not understand why!, if I call the FBI or the police I can have support to know who owns this address to find my Bitcoins?

Je suis sur que vous pouvez savoir à qui appartient cette adresse, ce n'est pas normal ! sinon ça voudrais dire que vous m'avez volé de l'argent ! 
C'est votre parole contre la mienne, mais comme je vous l'ai dit, j'ai toujours procédé comme d’habitude ! et je ne mettais jamais trompé d'adresse et je n'avais jamais perdu mes bitcoins !!

I'm sure you can know who this address belongs to, it's not normal! otherwise it would mean that you stole money! 
This is your word against mine, but as I told you, I always proceeded as usual! and I never made a mistake and I never lost my bitcoins !!

Since this message, I tried to change channels on my Ledger Nano S wallet, but my Bitcoin are not in Legacy and Segwit.
I am not a liar, I would like help to find a solution to know where are my bitcoin and how to find them, I am lost and sad.
Before I loved Bitcoin and crytpo-currency a lot, but now I've lost a lot of money that I've invested in losing my bitcoin.

I am in financial difficulty in life now, I really rely on Bitcoin to help me financially, I work as a student in professional conversion and my salary is very low and I have a woman who works in the sale and who does not earn much either ...
I really wish you could help me, I do not know what else to do apart from proving what I tell you is true!

My real Bitcoin address is: 12tvHR1GLqkxtizGqgknEc3scEt7rsvS89

I can give you more information about my identity if you are ready to help me and see that everything I write to you is not wrong.

Greeting, an honest person looking for help.
"
2402,"With Bitcoin on a steady upward trajectory, we've all heard about the 20 something old who retired. Where does an exchange company get that kind of US dollars to buy Bitcoin, or other cryptos, at a much higher price?"
2403,"♪♫ Well somebody told me

that he had some bitcoin

that some scammer perloined

Way back in February of last year

It's not confidential

He’s lost its potential

A rushin', a rushin' around..♪♫
"
2404,"As we all know the bitcoin game is a long term strategy, now if we look at the exchanges that promoted s2x, what are their incentives? The sub mainly talks about miner incentives but exchanges are very similar in a way.

Segwit abstracts the need to operate in a centralized exchange, it allows us to build decentralized ones, leaving the centralized ones in the dust. 
When you think about it, its better for them to keep bitcoin static, and scale their servers to cope with the demand, the high fees keep the bitcoin on their servers giving them liquidity. 

just my 2 cents."
2405,I have $326 but the fee is $20 dollars? I'm on Exodus. How can I bypass this
2406,"**""""I would bet against Bitcoin, if my goal was to lose money.""""

The only correct sentence to explain that view, not motivated by bias.**

You see, Adam Ozimek would be wrong, if his statement was published any time in 99.99% of Bitcoin's life.

2009-2016 Bitcoin has never been valued in these magnitudes. I believe everyone could say, that while there were theorized reasons it would collapse or fail. Those reasons never came to fruition.

So, theory, failure.

Applied practical events that actually happened, success.


There is a different reason to bet against Bitcoin. Say, if you want the market value to decrease, so you can take a more powerful buy condition, in your favor.

Most people who publicly bet against Bitcoin, would not have the ability to affect market valuation...

But if you were a journalist for one of the world's largest financial news publications... Your public defacement could lower the valuation by a measurable percentage.

In any established investment vehicle, this would be a, hammer and nail, conflict of interest, SEC violation.

Since Bitcoin can be obtained anonymously, one could execute these actions, with no fear of reprisal or SEC fine.

However, anyone willing to roll those dice, would likely have OTHER investments that could be traced, and are also in violation of financial conflicts of interest. No blacksmith strikes the iron only once.

Perhaps these possibilities would create a justification and probable cause for scrutiny and a comprehensive audit.

Given that **Bitcoin IS ENTERING regulated trade space via CME, TD Ameritrade, and being offered for futures option positions, it would absolutely fall under conflict of interest and audit jurisdiction.**

If I personally, were to attempt the illegal action I outlined, I would definitely want to do it, BEFORE that futures trading option goes live.

However, I would have to be a bumbling idiot, to try that, less than 72 hours beforehand.

I would be an even larger idiot, if I worked for a large financial company such as Forbes, and used them as a platform to create this action.

This would be completely idiotic, because not only would I expose myself to audit scrutiny and potential fines, I would be placing my employing company in a position of liability, opening them up to the same scrutiny.

Now, if I were a smart company, and an employee tried this, I would fire them immediately, before the hammer of investigation comes down.

Just so it was clear, that my company was not involved, and alleviate this liability.

I am not claiming any of this happened, as I have outlined.

I am not claiming any person or company is personally at fault.

I am just discussing that these are hypothetical possibilities, that could be considered.

So, any SEC investigators drooling at the mouth yet?"
2407,"I've been using coinbase so far, but I really like the view and control you have on GDAX, but am unable to buy/sell there since I need a passport to verify, was hoping ID from coinbase would be enough, but it doesn't look like it.

Any suggestions?"
2408,"Through chain splits of the bitcoin blockchain and altcoin airdrops to bitcoin holders everyone holding bitcoin can generate a sort of dividend by collecting and exchanging free altcoins for more bitcoin.

I have been working on a simple site where one can view available altcoin balance on any Bitcoin address.

I've also compiled a list of over 20 altcoins that gives some sort of Dividends to Bitcoin owners, either via airdrops or chain forks.

I hope it can be of some use:

2409,"Bitcoin needs a high profile spokesman that will actively work to dispel the FUD and the anti-BTC rhectoric the BCH camp and Roger Ver are spreading on TV, Radio and over the internet. The Bitcoin brand is being highjacked by Ver and Co and something must be done. "
2410,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/net-neutrality-ruling-1.4449904
2411,To me it just seems so effortless how we can purchase bitcoin wait a couple months and double our investments. At this point I'm making more than my full time job by just letting money sit in my wallet and forgetting about it.
2412,"I just thought of this idea, please let me know what you think...

Because bitcoin is on a public ledger, we can see the addresses with the most\least bitcoins. 

Unfortunately, we're seeing the same '1%' effect, where small portion of people hold the majority of BTC.

So I was thinking of creating a lottery website where people donate any amount of BTC they desire which goes into a escrow fund. 

Periodically, the system will select a group of bitcoin addresses at a certain value level (ex: addresses below 1BTC). Then it would send funds to these pseudo randomly selected addresses.
"
2413,I’ve been seeing a lot of info on integration test progress for LN however I’m still pretty new to the crypto space. Is there any rough estimate on when it will be ready for use?
2414,I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. What are your thoughts?
2415,"please help Confirm the sending.

https://blockchain.info/tx/9fc0b2c53fc1fd82c1bb29bf2d675a94866834a1b9b9159a28aec1ff7dd80c0a"
2416,"Been thinking about crypto for the past few days especially with BTC forks like BCH and BTG. I know many here are ready to shit on those forks, and I agree with you guys, but selling it off or trading it isn't as easy as it seems. I've been thinking of moving those funds, and was ready to convert it all to BTC until I thought more about the taxes more.

Hypothetically, if have 100 BTC and now have 100 BCH and BTG, converting that 100 BCH =&gt; BTC for instance today would trigger a massive tax bill. That's a $200k sale, and one would have to cough up maybe $50k or more (depending on your tax bracket, and state) to cover that.

Now of course some here will say taxation is theft. Fine. You probably could Shapeshift those funds without issues. What happens when you decide to start cashing out BTC next year of 5 years later? The IRS could see that you failed to pay taxes in 2017 during the fork, and you could jeopardize future accessibility to your funds.

So now faced with that choice, it seems that if I ever want to move any BCH/BTC around, I should plan for paying up taxes immediately, which is an accounting nightmare.

The second issue seems to be the fact that moving these funds reduces privacy. 100 BCH or 100 BTG might not seem like massive life changing amounts, but if you're not careful, moving those funds easily reveals your 100 BTC. I'm not even sure how to best approach this, but it seems like after each fork, one should sweep all their funds (of either or even both sets of coins) into new separate addresses. It still doesn't take rocket science to figure out that the two sets of funds are linked. Maybe a tumbler?

Anyone look into these issues yet?"
2417,"After reading and watching a load of talks and books in the past few weeks, I cannot tell you how excited I am. I know I'm late to the party, but this... this is going to change the world. I feel energized and optimistic in a way I haven't felt in a very long time. 

So, I am ready to make the jump and buy some BTC, but I believe in the philosophy of a free currency, and I'm convinced for that to be true, regular old Joe's transactions need to be anonymous.

I tried online, but that was a no-no. Every place I checked requires identification and subsequent verification (Coinbase, Bitpanda, Bitmama, Krakhen, Belgacoin, Bitcoin.de). Cannot use bisq, because I still don't own any. 

So, while I am full on into blockchain currency and would prefer to buy close to 1BTC, I resign myself to much less as a proof of concept, and I say let's go with the only easy alternative I know: cash. 
After checking localbitcoins, I got in touch with three personal traders. All three replied pretty quickly, in less than 24h, but said they had ran out and needed to take the posting down. So I resigned myself to exchange businesses and ATMs. I selected 1 shop and 2 ATMs and traveled to the biggest city around, Barcelona (Spain). I spent over 5 hours going from place to place and visited the first three spots. Then I expanded the trip to all 6 spots I could find listed in Barcelona, because damn if I wasn't going to get some. My report card (so much failure):

- two machines had been decommissioned long ago
- two places were closed (note that this was 9am-1pm, within working hours)
- another one was closed but answered to the phone saying they were out, 
- finally, the last shop was open, but the machine was out of order (they said they had sold whatever remnants they had first thing in the morning).

And here I am, with three empty wallets and a flaccid phone. Is that...

- normal where you are from or an issue local to Barcelona?
- common all the time or limited to this time/craze?
- do you know of a reputable cash seller in Barcelona or any anon alternative?
- are there any thoughts/concerns/attempts at addressing that situation in the community that I have missed?

tl;dr went to buy some coin. walked a lot. returned home with zero coin. ::sad::"
2418,"So my ledger nano S finally arrived to day. I currently hold all my funds on my Electrum (regular) wallet.

2431,"So bitcoin has made some very select and smart users very wealthy. And I’m sure made lots of other users plenty of money too. But I was wondering what it the plan from the start was to create the Blockchain, Entice users to mine and buy coins, and use the exchange etc.

But what if the main reason behind it was for the exchanges to steal all of the users coin and run off with the money. MTGOX, BITTREX now, the shit with Coinbase recently, bitstampt etc. 

What if that was the plan from jump street. Sucker in investors and let them make some money but in the end the exhanges “have some technical issues” then disappear with a large amount of users funds?

Try not to shit on me too much, I’ve been following since 2012 like a hardcore nerd, but I haven’t been able to buy in because of a back disability and I just keep seeing sooooo many stories and issues with people/exhanges. 

I don’t mean to sound like a conspiracy theorist but I read way too much and it seem like yes there are guys making money with this, but that the exchanges are the ones actually making INSANE profits and then “shutting down”

I also rarely see good advice on how to avoid being hacked. Yes, hardware wallets are secure. Yes it is best to hold your own private keys. But only some people are going to follow this advice because (1) people have different use cases/patterns with crypto, (2) people on average are not very creative and lack critical thinking abilities (ie. cannot perceive attack vectors), and (3) people trade security for convenience.

Instead of dishing out the same advice that is stagnant and not adaptable, I propose the following to curb fishing / fake website attacks:

1. The community create a scam page with a list of domains that are known fishing sites.

2. The community recommend domain blockers for various operating systems.

3. All a web-wallet user has to is install a domain blocker, add the most up to date list of fishing sites, and they have secured themselves almost to the fullest extent within their power when using web-wallets.

2460,"PIA has aquired blockexplorer.com which has then announced to refer to a centralized altcoin as """"Bitcoin"""" in the future. I am flabbergasted that a company that has a business model based on trusting them and that had such a good reputation is fucking that up by promoting an outright scam. Same counts for Rick Falkvinge, who works for both companies and is obviously the person initiating this weird move. Rick is """"head of privacy"""" at PIA and CEO of blockexplorer.com and is at the same time publishing outright lies about Bitcoin's technology (like """"Segwit is patented"""": https://falkvinge.net/2017/05/01/blockstream-patents-segwit-makes-pieces-fall-place/ despite knowing very well that no such patents exist).

However, since they cannot be trusted anymore and since I will in no way support the intended dillution of the Bitcoin brand in order to confuse newbies and trick them into buying fake bitcoins I am looking for an alternative VPN provider who accepts Bitcoin.

2466,"When I first heard payment channel capacity is based on how much bitcoin is backing it, I thought bitcoin would become really scarce and valuable

But now I am wondering if there is any functional difference between having a payment channel backed by a large amount, vs having a payment channel backed by a very small amount where a user can just blast a ton of transactions in very quick succession to pay for something

Even exchanges could just find the optimal small size of payment channels

Am I understanding this possibility correctly? Is there an incentive to create larger payment channels which has the effect of making bitcoin much more scarce?"

If it can't be patched, I personally wouldn't feel confident enough to invest in the future of Bitcoin, if it is suggested that the fees and delays will only continue to increase in time.

2471,"Hey,

I’m thinking the following:

1. Bitcoin is the mass market use-case for blockchain. Will become something like digital Gold.
2. Etherum wants to be platform for blockchain but it’s apps are mainly similar bitcoins with better tech. All of the token are heavily based on their economies and therefore  nothing really new. Scalability issues.
3. IOTA and Tangle is the next version of the blockchain/maybe even an Etherum-style platform on a better version of the blockchain. 
4. Now all of these are just platforms, where are the actual HUGE use-cases that will eventually BE the users of the technology and not just another platform with it’s own token and lot of speculative money that takes away the attention from the technology and focuses it on money making, therefore attracts too much money, too much malbehavior because you can steal money, therefore attracts it’s own death by abusers that always come with big money.
5. Internet = InformationTechnology. Now the first application on top of the internet that really made a lot of sense was email. Later the browser. All of them are information technology.
6. Blockchain = Decentralized Systems with Zero Transaction Fees. First (and only) application that really makes sense for mass scale is a decentralised currency because it benefits most from no-transaction fees and having a decentralised system.
7. If whole blockhain market converges among best a) technology to scale b) platform with biggest network effects/applications that attract even more people at some point, all blockchain products will be level out at 0 transaction fees. If that’s the point, we basically have ONE currency: An international 0 fee exchange money that will change worldwide money flow and therefore worldwide economy.
8. Thus bet on ALL cryptos in a well diversified portfolio.

What do you say? Sorry if not everything is written as neat, it’s late where I am. Peace out.

2499,"I met up with my team last weekend for a belated holiday party. We work as consultants in the information security industry and all live near major cities on the West coast with large technology company footprints. After considering a few gag gifts for our white elephant gift exchange, I decided on something with more utility: $25USD (our price limit for gifts) worth of bitcoin.

Fortunately I didn't buy the bitcoin 2 months ago when we were originally supposed to have the party, as I have been in the cryptocurrency space for a few years and have witnessed the price volatility firsthand. I've also gifted small amounts of bitcoin before and was met with a lot of confusion about how exactly it all works, not to mention the difficulty of securing the wallet's private key.

With this in mind, I decided to print an IOU and have a discussion with whoever got it about options for securely accepting/storing, as well as to give the person the opportunity to receive altcoins in lieu of bitcoin (hold your pitchforks, I did this for a reason).

**Observations/outcomes from the gift exchange:**

Out of a group of almost a dozen people, none owned bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies (besides me). These are people with technical backgrounds and decades of experience in the information security sector. They have worked for tech companies that are regarded as industry leaders; many are household names. All of them had heard of bitcoin (not surprising) and most were interested in it to some degree. A few said they had considered buying or had even tried to buy some in the past but had not had the time to actually complete a transaction or finish the account setup process.

Only one person made a comment about how bitcoin had """"crashed"""", but it was mostly in good fun as we all like to give each other hell from time to time. I was prepared for this topic though, and the inside of the card contained a graph of the price chart over the past year. It segued into a great conversation about why the best long-term strategy is to hodl and how media reports manipulate the truth in order to maximize drama (aka clickbait, a concept with which we were all familiar). The same person who made the crash comment later told me that he was mostly just frustrated that he hadn't bought any bitcoin when it was cheaper.

My IOU card was by far the smallest present in size. It was picked by the second oldest person in our group (mid-40s) with 3-4 gifts still remaining (out of maybe 7 or 8 total), and was promptly stolen within 1-2 turns by the youngest person in our group (30). My numbers aren't exact because alcohol was involved. ;) For context: white elephant gift exchanges involve each person drawing a number and then taking turns choosing either an unopened present or to steal a present that has already been opened. 

The person who initially chose the card still ended up getting some BTC even though the gift was stolen by someone else in the group. He did this by paying for my breakfast in exchange for me sending him the equivalent amount in BTC.

Both people chose to receive bitcoin instead of any altcoins, though we did have a great discussion about some other projects I personally find interesting (ethereum, steem, and storj). I offered the option to receive altcoins mainly because I was interested to see what the recipient would choose.

Both chose to receive their bitcoin via newly created coinbase accounts. I know many here aren't the biggest fans of Coinbase, but they had both already heard of the company and opted to use it for now due to the low barrier of entry. I did discuss hardware wallets and some desktop/mobile wallet solutions, and strongly recommended they explore those options if they start to accumulate any serious quantities of cryptocurrency. 

Both were interested in mining and seemed a bit disappointed when I let them know that it's pointless to try to CPU/GPU mine BTC at this point. I told them about ASIC mining but neither seemed to show any interest in purchasing special equipment. They are both now mining monero though with PCs that were collecting dust in the closet, even though I made sure to let them know that they will not make much in the way of profit unless the value of monero goes up.

All in all it was a very interesting weekend... I got to nerd out and talk about cryptocurrency with some coworkers, and also get a feel for real-world bitcoin adoption among technical people (short version: there's a TON of room to grow). It's anecdotal, obviously... but I thought I'd post it here in case anyone else was interested.

2506,"The stock market took a dive today when the rates shot to almost 3%. If you notice around the world interest rates are rising everywhere. Germany, Japan, Switzerland and others had negative interest rates (yes, you *paid* the gov to lend *them* money!).

2507,"Innovations in the field of decentralisation, focusing on such issues as exclusion of man-in-the-middle in trustless environments, protecting user, data and financial privacy, asset inalienability and censorship-resistance need to be funded by the community in a transparent and unregulated way with proper long-term capitalistic rewards both to project founders, key persons and investors. ROI for such persons must be proportional only to the amount of risk appetite of betters and overall project success and adoption.

Existing models of funding being popular in crypto community, such as pre-mine or ICO, do not suit these goals, usually being easily censorable by regulators, vulnerable to thefts (due to centralised cost storage on accounts). Also they lead to uncontrollable inflation in overall volume of cryptocurrency, diminishing value of existing currencies in unpredictable way and creating risks for new economical crises of deleveraging as can happen with many loosely-connected assets without clear and predictable market supply.

Other alternatives, being explored by bitcoin community, like self-funding, charity, value-added services (consulting etc), early mining etc have many other drawbacks such as reward not proportional to the project success or the risk undertaken, difficulties with attracting pre-launch funding, free-rides and generic """"left""""-type of approach (""""for the benefit of community"""").

Here I propose a new scheme for funding which does not inflate the overall volume of digital gold however creates ROI for the founders and developers with a decentralised treasury and dividends, making possible also early-stage funding of such projects with venture capital.

The generic idea is the following:

* a new type of blockchain is created, which primary token (tokenA) is linked to bitcoin blockchain either as a sidechain (once/if it will be adopted in Bitcoin mainnet) or with a proof of burn, atomic swaps and demurrage (for achieving 1-to-1 linking with bitcoin with two-way liquidity) but without pre-mine or mining;

* the blockchain takes pre-defined commission from each transaction; this commission is allocated not on an account but as a blockchain-based basic supply for some blockchain-based secondary token (tokenB);

* tokenB represents dividends token: all token owners receive part of the commission proportional to their share in total tokenB supply (i.e. dividends are paid by network/consensus/protocol);

* tokenB tokens can be pre-mined, sold to investors, given as an options and issued in any other possible way that suits needs and plans of founders and project investors."

Well it's 8 hrs now and the transfer status has not changed.  

It is showing as unconfirmed in my Trezor wallet and the status in Kucoin is showing zero confirmations.

I have moved coins around from wallets/exchanges before and have never had anything like this happen.  The transfer was initiated 2 hours before the snapshot - but since it is not confirmed it was a wasted effort.

If you’re in the U.S., Australia or the U.K. and you’re not keeping a record of your capital expenses then you’re basically throwing money away.

I assumed this was some sort of error so I tried to send my whole ~0.035 to a new wallet, and it says it can only send ~0.025 because all the rest is """"dust"""", which apparently means tiny balances spread across tons of wallet addresses, all too small to be used.

No matter how well intentioned the Winklevii are, if they do not create rules to self-govern their own body, eventually it will be corrupted from the inside out with traditional revolving door corruption practices.

We need to stand up now and say that in order for us to accept and promote such organizations to be a leader in the regulated crypto space, we want to see clauses in the Company's Ethos that designate anti-corruption practices.

-No collusion. (Organizers crafting regulation in secret with businesses to optimize pro-business/anti-consumer positions)

-No revolving doors. (Clause must disallow regulatory government agents from taking jobs within this organiztion, and vice versa, for at *least* 3 years).

-No secret meetings (publicized minutes)

2538,"Why is called it r/btc when it only promotes bitcoin cash? Why is it not called r/bch or r/bitcoincash? 

I thought the whole point was r/bitcoin is accused of being censored rather moderated and therefore Roger Ver setup r/btc as a place where all bitcoin topics could be discussed without censorship.

Ok fair enough if you believe the above. Go ahead and setup a new sub reddit, but Roger is very much the closest thing that bitcoin cash has to a mouth piece. Is he an appropriate moderator for a unbiased/balanced/uncensored subreddit? 

From observation the majority of content on that subreddit is either pro bitcoin cash or making negative statements about this sub reddit. It does not appear to be a place balance at all.

So why call it btc why not bch or bitcoincash? Hopefully new users will realise how manipulative the r/btc narrative is in trying to garner their attention and favor.

I’m not commenting on the technology here; I think both chains are realistic attempts at scaling and we probably needed to try them both.

2546,"If the statement above doesn't apply to your situation (which it doesn't, for 90% of the blockchain projects) than you're good enough with a regular database.

Explanation: We always hear that blockchain has many advantages. Decentralized. Distributed. Immutable.

All these advantages can be reduced to a single core advantage. Blockchain data can't be modified/changed/deleted by any person/cooperation/government in the world. You can put [child pornography](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/20/child-abuse-imagery-bitcoin-blockchain-illegal-content) inside your blockchain and all the governments in the world combined won't have the ability to remove that content.

Blockchain can't be changed, can't be modified, can't be deleted. It's forever.

That's the core advantage of blockchain technology.

The only reason why you would need something that is unchangeable forever is if some other entity (person/government) has the Motive and (not less important) the Ability to change that data.

If you checkout all the existing uses of blockchain, you can see in all of them that there is obviously a will and ability of some entities to change the data. Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, Voting, Identification. All of the current major uses of blockchain technology clearly have an entity with a Motive and Ability which is prevented thanks to blockchain technology.

So before you go and start a new blockchain project, please ask yourself if someone has the Motive and Ability to change your data. If not, don't use the slow, inefficient, complicated database called blockchain."

Li Yuan is the CEO of Beijing Thinkyoung Technology Co.. As an expert of blockchain technology, he led the team and won the first prize of the first China Blockchain Innovation Application Contest and the first prize of the first Blockchain Development Contest. In 2017, the SelfSell brand was created to build a “people-oriented” investment and financing platform, which allows direct investment in human, the fundamental agent through which all value can be created. SelfSell takes investment closer to its nature. This concept was strongly supported by Thomas Sargent, the 2011 Nobel Prize winner in economics and the leader of the rational anticipation school. Let's take a deeper look at the SelfSell project today."

2564,"One of the downsides to centralized ledgers is that you must trust those who have access to them not to change them. Blockchain tech is obviously much different. I'm under the impression that for someone to change Bitcoin's transaction history they'd have to go through all of these steps:

1. Control 51% or more of the mining power.
2. Change a past transaction.
3. Change all transactions affected by that transaction, up to the present moment. This must be done faster than the rate at which new blocks are added.
4. Somehow apply the change to every node on the network?

2570,"With big names like Soros, Rockefeller and other large traditional hedge funds now eyeing the crypto market with internal approval to trade.

Remember this little fun fact.

At this price level, if you short the market the maximum gains are capped at 100%, while if you go long the maximum gains are infinite because no one knows how high the crypto market can go. 

Even if the price of BTC went back to $20k thats 250% to 300% return from this point, and everyone knows if we get back to $20k we will go a lot higher.

So after bitcoin has already experienced a 65% decline in price this year it makes absolutely no sense to try and short an extremely limited market when you can go long a potentially unlimited market.

These big names in finance are not looking to short, they are waiting and getting ready to buy in at the bottom then ride this next wave up.

Remember Soros' short trade on the British Pound? He pocketed $1 billion in profit from the Pound crashing. these guys are not here to kill bitcoin and save fiat, they are here to make as much money as possible, and at this point in time they will accomplish that by buying low then driving the bitcoin market to insane heights.

2574,"Among such countries as USA, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia and Malta I would also mention Finland. 

""""Suomen Pankki"""" (SP) (Finland's Central Bank) may be considered a hero role model for other EU financial watchdogs to follow. Not only its officials have been closely monitoring crypto-currencies market for years, gradually deepening their understanding of decentralized digital money environment, but also bank's official statements are remarkably different in its measured and thoughtful tonality from wild, almost maniacal crypto-hunt reports issued by some EU financial institutions.

For example, in January 2014, in the wake of anti-crypto-mania SP published on its web-page the following testimony, which was surreptitiously named """"Bitcoin involves risks"""". Sure, as any other government backed, coercive, centralized financial gatekeeper, which job is to preserve the stability of the current fractional reserve monetary system, SP is far from being """"pro-Bitcoin"""" in it.

Still, when SP's communique says, for instance - """"Use of Bitcoin does, however, involve risks for the user, and its value vis-a-vis official currencies has fluctuated significantly."""" and """"The value of a virtual currency is based on supply and demand only. Authorities or other public bodies are not responsible for the purchasing power or stability of Bitcoin, and it can lose its value."""" that sound like reasonable, although, negative statements, which, however, do not try to invoke readers' fear or to speculate on public ignorance.

There's no surprise, then, that Finland today possesses one of the most crypto-friendly legal environment on the planet. Even though Finnish tax authorities fully tax all profits derived from crypto-transactions, virtual currencies are exempt from VAT. Additionally, you are not require to obtain a special banking license or to follow KYC rules in order to run a local crypto-broker. As usual, government's friendly approach to crypto-businesses is gratified by the surge of entrepreneurial activity in the country. For example, Finland, among other big technological companies, already harbors World's biggest P2P Bitcoin exchange.

Let’s take a moment to play Devil’s advocate. Blockchain as a concept right now is far from perfect. There, I said it. There are problems under the hood that need to be resolved. From developer wars to uncertainty in technological aspects. These need to be solved as development moves forward, otherwise blockchain will not become the game changer that I and many others expect it will."
2578,"We are being asked to think about how blockchain can be leveraged on our hardware and what we can do to add value to the current OEM hardware that we have and make reference architectures.

I understand there are a lot of examples out there, but with we owning the hardware and time on our hands, I was wondering if the community has ideas of what can be done as RA and then presented it as a solution or a paper to some early adopters out there?

Thank you"
2579,"I used to be really active on this subreddit but haven't been in quite a while. I have since started a podcast reading audio versions of all the best Bitcoin articles in the space.  I can always consume content at about 100x the rate in audio form than in written form.  I started the podcast assuming I am probably not the only who would've benefitted greatly from something like that being available.  With that, I have ventured back to r/bitcoin recently and seen questions and concerns about Lightning network that show how unfamiliar many still are with it. 

The last 4 episodes of my podcast have all been dedicated to painting a picture of the system that makes the Lightning Network both secure and a significant innovation to crypto.  The first 3 break it down at a technical level by reading, summarizing, and commentating on Aaron van Wirdum's (from BitcoinMagazine) excellent explanatory series that was one of my first introductions to it a few years back.  Then the 4th episode is a final summary (repetition is the only way to really get the whole picture) and then I answer a lot of the common complaints and FUD around it that can be easily addressed from a clear technical perspective.

I have done this specifically for new people who want to learn, so I hope somebody can get something out of it.  I have a few friends that have listened to it multiple times trying to get a better understanding (which might be needed).  With that, I'll provide the links and feel free to share it with anyone you think will be interested or who believes something about Lightning that just isn't remotely true.  Hopefully this can shed some light.

2583,"Hey folks,

Without delving into the shitstorm of hell that my life became on April 10th, my brother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack 10 days ago; he was 49 and this just should not have happened. 

Despite my being knee-deep in grief at the moment, I'm also likely going to be in charge of probating his estate; my dude lived  across the country in Colorado and had a home, a couple vehicles etc. that needs to be dealt with. He also owned a small amount of Bitcoin as well as two alts, all of which he was managing via the Breadwallet iPhone app.

Ideally, I would like to either transfer his BTC/alts to my wallet or (perhaps better for probating the estate) just gain access to his wallet and keep his balance as is. Even though he only had a small amount of cryptos, we were both really into it in recent months and I know for a fact that he would want to HODL rather than cash things out (I wish he was around to see the recent uptick). 

I have his phone, but his 14-word key is very likely hidden in some box at his house out in Colorado. We talked briefly about it when I went out to visit him in February but just changed the subject because again, this was not supposed to happen. I'm assuming my first step is going out there and digging for that, but I wanted to get everyone's thoughts on what the best course of action here would be. "

Every Bitcoin supporters I hope you guys take the opportunity and fight back to put them down and cover the losses of our poor panic sellers. I bought back few days ago and already up I'm not a big whale but I will dump over 100 Bkash and bring this money floating in Bitcoin. I don’t recommend buying now(mostly the weak hands) because the pomp already started but I do expect roger to squeeze this shit near .2 btc+ before a big domp.

2587,"Hi everyone, I am going to write my Master Thesis about inefficiencies in Cryptocurrencies this summer and wanted to know whether you have suggestions what potential inefficiencies I could analyze. I have a finance background and know a company with a huge database on cryptocurrency prices.
An example I could think of would be for example arbitrage opportunities due to different prices of the same cryptocurrency at different exchanges. I want to show that a certain inefficiency exists, and then in the discussion provide explanations for why those inefficiencies might exist.
My thesis should consist of analyses on several such inefficiencies. Help would very much appreciated!"

2596,"A U.S. federal judge rejected Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd.’s move to block Dubai cryptocurrency firm Alibabacoin Foundation from using the Alibaba name for its Alibabacoin virtual currency.

In his ruling, Judge Paul Oetken of the Southern District of New York (i.e., Manhattan) denied Alibaba’s motion on jurisdictional grounds, saying it failed to show that the use of the Alibabacoin name would hurt its business prospects in New York or would infringe its trademarks in New York.

Surprisingly, the judge said it didn’t matter that Alibabacoin might eventually be listed on a New York exchange.

Judge: No Infringement In New York
Judge Oetken said any damage to Alibaba’s business or reputation from the allegedly infringing use of the Alibaba name occurs in China, not in New York. A U.S. federal judge has no jurisdiction on legal issues that occur in a foreign country.

Alibabacoin contends that China’s ban on initial coin offerings eliminates any possibility that consumers in China will be confused into thinking the Alibabacoin is associated with Alibaba Group.

In a statement on May 1, 2018, Alibabacoin said the judge made the right decision, tweeting: “We firmly believe that Alibabacoin Foundation never acted illegally. Fair and square speaking, we strongly believe and trust the judge’s decision above all else.”

Alibaba Group had sued Alibabacoin Foundation in April 2018, claiming the foundation was unlawfully piggybacking off its name to promote its cryptocurrency.

Alibabacoin: Alibaba Can’t Monopolize Name
Alibabacoin Foundation (also known as ABBC) responded by filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying Alibaba Group cannot monopolize the “magical” Alibaba name, Reuters reported.

“The legend of Alibaba conjures up thoughts of magic, gold coins, and ‘Open Sesame,’” the Alibabacoin Foundation argued. “The ABBC entities are well within their rights to use a word connoting magic and golden coins in an area (Alibaba) has not used or, at the very least, has abandoned.”

Interestingly, Alibaba Group’s CEO Jack Ma is a bitcoin skeptic who has expressed concerns over its opaqueness and potential for use in money-laundering, as CCN has reported.

“Bitcoin is not for me,” Ma said. “We are not focused on bitcoin. We are focused on a cashless society for China…trying to make sure the society is more efficient, more transparent, with no corruption.”



Despite his bearishness about bitcoin, Jack Ma is bullish on blockchain. Lynx International, a subsidiary of Alibaba, has successfully integrated blockchain into its cross-border logistics operations.

And it’s likely that Alibaba Group will continue to incorporate blockchain technology into its vast business empire, whose 2017 revenue topped $22 billion."
