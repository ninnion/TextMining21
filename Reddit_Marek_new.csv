6,"Have been doing some crypto currency trading for a month or two now. Considering silk road 2 just went down and what is happening to RUR, I think it will spike at least to 550 without a correction back under 400.

7,"I really want to start earning bitcoin, although mining isn't a possibility for me. Is there any resources online that allow me to do this?"
8,"In a near future, businesses that take bitcoin may wish to pay their taxes directly in bitcoin. For that, the IRS has to have a way to know how much the business has made, in order to calculate the amount owed.

This means:

**1)** Either they use a single payment address and everyone can see exactly how much they are making, and where they are spending it, or

**2)** They use multiple addresses, to increase anonymity. This means the IRS has no way of guaranteeing how much the business has made, since a dishonest business may decide not to disclose all the addresses used to the IRS. 

Are there any solutions to this problem yet?

I have been thinking of a solution that resembles *stealth addresses*, with a little twist: 

**a)** A single """"stealth address"""" is generated by the business. This address is generated using one (or more) public key(s) from the business and a public key from the IRS. 

**b)** Each sender could verify that the payment was sent, but could not see the total amount sent to that address.

**c)** The twist is that the address was generated in a way that allowed the holder of a specific private key (the IRS, in this case) to see the amount sent to that business' address, but not to move the coins. The coins can only be moved by the business (that holds the necessary private keys).

(Of course payments could be made to another address, but that would require cooperation from the sender. Using the public key provided by the IRS, any user would be able to see if an address is/isn't linked to the IRS).

Transactions from that address would require 2-of-3 private keys (in the case where it's created using 2 keys from the business and one from the IRS). This means the IRS could not move the coins, but the business could move them at their will.

This would be heaven for the IRS, since all the monitoring is very easy to do.

Share your thoughts on this. Am I missing something? Cheers. "
9,I've been hearing about important people who LOVE the blockchain but hate bitcoin the currency. And they think that they can benefit from the blockchain without currency/reward. Is this even possible? Why not just use an internal DB?
10,Let's ask for them to accept Bitcoin. Are there any alternative ways?
11,"Before everyone throws their hands up shouting about business privacy, etc, of course the data can be encrypted with the manufacturers key so that it is only transparent to the manufacturer!

I recently was looking for a tool, and the manufacturer's website had a pretty cool feature that allowed me to search local stores to see if they had it in stock. This got me thinking about how elaborate inventory systems are, and how much of a nightmare they must be to maintain between the manufacturer and the distributors/retailers. Im sure this is big business for inventory software companies.

If there was such a thing as a global ledger that allowed POS terminals to tx updates upon each purchase, the system could manage itself allowing for manufacturers to automatically ship items to distributors based on products going beneath supply threshold levels, and would allow for the above customer service scenario in which a manufacturer can easily tell customers where items are in stock."
12,"I thought i would just share my story with all of you because it may help at least one of you keep your paper wallets safe. Here's my kind of boring story:

I went into the super secret shoebox where I keep super secret things like old weird paper money, old silver coins, a usb with some cool shit on it and my paper bitcoin wallets. I noticed my old decrepit blackberry in the box. It looked a bit fucky so i picked it up and noticed that THE FUCKING OLD LI-ION BATTERY WAS BALLOONING!!

Well not really ballooning, but super bulgy and could pop, explode, burn or whatever all over my cool box of cool shit, which would be super shitty for me and my box and it's sweet ass contents. 

Disaster averted but it was a close one and will undoubtedly have nightmares for the rest of my life. 

Also i could have burned down my entire building. 

So go check your secret hidey places for flammables and stuff.

cheers,

17,"Can I link my both bank accounts to one paypal account and transfer it from one to the other through paypal? If so are there any fees?

Thanks a lot!"
18,"I understand that confirmations are required to protect against a double spend.  E.g. if somebody broadcasts to the network a transaction with a low value and no transfer fee it could potentially take days for that transaction to ever get included in a block (""""confirmed""""), so somebody could re-spend the inputs for that transaction with a higher transaction fee which is more likely to be included in the Blockchain than the older low-value transaction - effectively a double spend.

If my understanding is correct (it very well may not be!) then surely when there is a single confirmation the transaction is set in stone in the blockchain, and there's no opportunity for a double-spend.

Could somebody explain to me what advantages there are waiting for *multiple* confirmations on a transaction before acknowledging that transaction?"

23,"I've been largely away from the coin community since summer, only occasionally glancing in, and it seem things have changed/developed with tipbots for various coins. Can someone give me a rundown on which tipbot(s) are most widely used, and/or can they at least send me the right direction to read up on it myself? 

I see """"changetip"""", is that the only one used for bitcoin? Sorry if that's a stupid question. I did read the FAQ, but didn't know if it up to date.

Is there a central source to see all the different tipbots now?

I see that """"bits"""" is taken hold. Seems reasonable. Anything else I should know or any place I should visit for tipping, good stuff that's not described on the FAQ?

30,"It is very obvious that the vast majority of bitcoin trading happens on the Chinese exchanges, and it also seems to be very big in mining. Both of these phenomenons are relatively recent though, as we've seen most bitcoins are dormant (or possibly lost), nearly half have not been touched since the 2013 bubble.

If bitcoins do ever go 'to the moon' ($100,000/BTC or greater), what sort of wealth transfer by nations do you expect? It seems that overall, unless Satoshi himself was British or Irish, Europeans have been dealing in Bitcoin much less than either Americans or Chinese. It seems we Europeans would be the greatest losers, as in the economic status quo the EU has a GDP twice that of China, but China is growing much faster."

34,"Hi, fellow redditors! Recently I found out that there is an [Uncyclopedia article] (http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Bitcoin) that may need some revamping. Added these:

""""Mining Bitcoins is, at present, the most geeky way of heating your house. You can even succeed to attract police raids seeing your increasing electricity bills!

37,"In my previous thread, I posted my experience with banks and accounts being suspended, when you do not use it. 

Today I went to the FIAT ATM to withdraw some fiat. {As we all know, we still need it, for those merchants, who does not support Bitcoin}

So, I try to withdraw fiat, and the next moment a screen pop up with this error... """"We are sorry, we are experiencing technical difficulties, try again later"""" 

I am 300 miles from the nearest alternative ATM, stuck with no money and a empty gas tank. 

Worst is, I do not know, if the transaction went through, and if it just did not provide me with the cash. {No immediate details and many phone calls to rectify it}

How many times, have I had to turn away from a fiat ATM, for one of these reasons: 

1. No cash in the ATM 
2. Data / Communication problems 
3. Keypad faulty 
4. No receipts slips 
5. OS/Software problems

39,"I am not a big fan of social messaging but I acknowledge that apps like Whatsapp and Viber are hugely successfully today because people like to communicate with each other through their personal mobile device.

People are familiar with social messaging apps but not Bitcoin apps like Blockchain.info wallet or Hive wallet. If only people are able to send money through social messaging apps, we could see a massive explosion in Bitcoin usage. I am using the specific term Bitcoin here and not the general cryptocurrency because (1) Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency today and (2) There is no need to reinvent the wheel by creating a new social messaging app specific cryptocurrency.

Which brings me next to Gems. Gems is a great idea because it combines social messaging with cryptocurrency. But by introducing the cryptocurrency Gems, it creates an additional layer of unnecessary complexity. Why not just use Bitcoin?

At the end of the day, what will really take off is to be able to send text messages as well as money over a single social platform. I see that either existing social applications will integrate Bitcoin into their system in the near future or Bitcoin wallet apps like Blockchain.info will add new chatting feature or a new class of text and money sending app will emerge. I see this happening within the next year.

Exciting times ahead because of Bitcoin. "
40,"Giving folks bitcoin (*e.g.*, paper wallets) as gifts has two major downside risks:
* That they not understand bitcoin and thus don't appreciate the gift, and
* That the value of the bitcoin go down significantly and they come to rue the day they received your gift.

Here's a time-proven way to overcome those problems: **Guarantee the value of the bitcoin gift for one year.**  Give it with this caveat/promise, either written or verbal: """"The price of bitcoin rises and falls sometimes dramatically. For that reason, I guarantee the value of this gift for one year.  If during that year the price goes down and you want to redeem the gift, I will buy it back from you for the exact dollar amount I paid for it. If the value goes up and you wish to keep the gift, all profits are yours to keep.""""

More times than not, this makes folks dig in and learn about bitcoin, even enough to start buying and using it on their own.  And if they end up asking you to redeem it for its original value, they're given one more occasion to thank you for your best wishes and generosity."

No plans to invest it, spend it, tip it, or gamble it. Just hodl. 

I have good credit, a good job, cash and I live on the east coast usa. I don't particularly want to give away a lot of personal information and financial information to buy this Bitcoin.

Don't know what happened, the PC was offline yesterday night so I guess that somebody must have copied it and emptied yesterday, it had a lot of different addresses because of changes and all were emptied, so I'm pretty sure I was keylogged and my wallet copied.

Scenario I: When btc price plummets, their buy/sell rates stay relatively the same. However, when the btc price increases, their buy/sell rates swing accordingly to the market value?

Scenario II: On a bearish day, when btc market value goes ~$373/btc (preev, bitcoinality, coindesk, etc) at 1PM-1:01PM, igot's buy/sell rates are $376/$371. On a bullish day, when btc market value goes ~$383/btc at 1PM-1:01PM , igot's buy/sell rates are $392/$383.

-----

A few years ago I was depressed, anxious and borderline paranoid. A heavy interest in politics and economics combined with a public education will do that to people these days. All through the public education machine I wondered... *Why are they doing things this way?* I mean it is the 21st century and we live in the richest country in the world. Your telling me that the school ran out of paper? *Seriously, you can't budget enough for paper?* Politics I don't even need to elaborate on. C-Span is as about as ridiculous as the comedy channel these days but its not funny because those people control our lives. 

Then along comes a Bitcoin. At first, like many of you I didn't give it the time of day. Then during my search for the causes of evil and the desire to find a form of money that isn't under the influence of bureaucracy or politics I stumble across Bitcoin again. I was really impressed, and amazed and thought it was too good to be true. I spent weeks locked in my room living off takeout and the mini-fridge trying to find the catch-22. Once I surfaced again I began to change. 

I admit it took a awhile to get balanced again but slowly over the last year I have settled down. My anxiety about the state of the world and the direction it is going in dissipated. I no longer feared the ignorance in the world and the crazy people in charge. I had a digital, stateless, borderless, indestructible, censorship-free form of trade, communication and money. At first it was the ultimate weapon in my mind. Visions of burning federal reserves and a crumbling capitol building filled my dreams. Its quite fun to be young and passionate about the world with a desire to change it. 

Over time the dreams have gotten more realistic. I realized that the old can not be destroyed without first having an alternative. This change would be rapid, but as our alternative grows the old system wanes. The fire engulfing the federal reserves became foreclosed signs. The crumbling capitol building became a museum and monument to the past. I understand that as much as I feel the primal urge to hang em all and let some invisible wizard sort the good from bad, we need to be better than them. We don't need to torture or kill our opponents, and especially not in some mob like fashion without a trial. Bitcoin threw back the curtain of our Wizard-of-Oz style oppressors. All we need to do to succeed is speak softly and offer the alternative. The way out of a system sustained with lies and corruption, the ultimate red pill.

If you truly believe in the core principles of Bitcoin then the free market must be pretty darn important to you. If you believe like I do that the free market is the most powerful than there will be no need for violence of any kind. Our product is vastly superior to anything else on the market today and it can adapt as fast as we need it to, so we will win. $1,000 per bitcoin was a valuation heard around the world. It was swiftly followed by the bursting of the parabolic bubble which has resulted in one of the longest if not to be the longest bear run in Bicoin's short history. Yet, I am not deterred. I have been inspired by what I have witnessed. 

I have watched as venture capitalists poor money into the system at a rate not seen sense the early days of the internet. Start-ups popped up faster than weeds in my yard. I participated in open beta's of new services that drew my attention and watched fondly as they grew in popularity. Two of my favorites are [LetsTalkBitcoin](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/) and [ChangeTip](https://www.changetip.com/). I attended the first Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas and was pleasantly surprised to have my brain completely melted before the lunch break on the first day. 

People that are involved in this space are smart and I was definitely not even in the top 50% of most intelligent people in that room. I heard aerospace engineers asking questions to the panelists and listened to a Chinese exchange CEO explain that over 75% of the people registering for his exchange had engineering degrees. Those people really knew their stuff and they were all working in or wanting to get involved in Bitcoin. I was intimidated and as snobby as it may sound that doesn't happen often for me. 

This road of bits has not been without setbacks. I lost 15 bitcoins due to not making backup copies of a cold storage paper wallet. Needless to say the running joke among my friends from when I left $200 in a movie theater picked up new steam. My first project was a combination of proof of identity and counterparty to build a charity hub for completely transparent direct charities that could track your donation all the way to the actual items purchased. That project was a bit too ambitious for an amateur like myself but I see others have taken up that mantel in different ways that may be even be better than my approach. I then turned to entertainment where I wanted to bring something like the classic trading card games to the blockchain. I again started with the wrong approach and I stumbled upon this cool project [Deckbound](https://www.deckbound.com/) that is doing such a better job than I was that I scrapped my idea in favor of following that project. Sure things have not been smooth sailing for me so far, but I am not deterred.

Bitcoin is not just a superior product. It is one of only a handful of investments that I can also agree with morally. Putting money in a bank or brokerage went out the window after I studied the perpetual war machine and how it was funded and maintained. It basically boiled down to physical commodities and Bitcoin. Everything else was tainted with fiat coupons and they generally made me sick to look at. It was like I was living in the movie [*They Live*](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/2224633/they-live-subliminal-message-o.gif). I know it isn't very popular these days to invest based off of moral reasons, but I think maybe it would be a better place if more people did. 

The """"*real*"""" markets don't really inspire much confidence now a days. The conspiracy theorists were generally proved right, all the markets are rigged. As Rinehart Founder Andrew Cunagin puts it in the WSJ article [here:](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-blames-high-frequency-trading-for-shutdown-1409853730) 
""""This is a circus market rigged by HFT and other algorithmic traders who prey on the rational behavior of warm-blooded investors,"""" - Mr. Cunagin. [GATA](http://www.gata.org/) has been screaming about commodity rigging for decades now. So if you trust the same people that are pushing for your currency in the bank to be [labeled as paper investments rather than money](http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2014/11/warning-bank-deposits-will-soon-no.html) so they can *bail-in* whenever they are in the mood.... well goodluck to you. I am not much of a doomsday prepper myself but things like the [Treasury Department Spending $200,000.00 on Survival Kit For Bank Employees](http://freebeacon.com/issues/treasury-department-seeking-survival-kits-for-bank-employees/) definitely gets my attention. 

To me Bitcoin is the least risky investment in the world right now. A bold statement, one that should attract some attention if trolls spend the time to read this extremely long post. Investing in Bitcoin by buying bitcoins is like owning a limited edition part of an industry index. This industry already contains the best form of money, the best money authentication system, the best money transfer service, the best money security and privacy options, all while being completely censorship-free, unexpected inflation-proof and immune from politics or bureaucracy. Oh it also is just about the only value transfer service that makes sense for micro-transactions and the internet of things/trade between machines. So even if we see *the big dip* right before the Bitcoin Bowl in the next few weeks, I will not be deterred.

It is time for me to embrace plan B. Yesterday I announced my intention to completely cut myself off from the fiat money system by January 1st, 2015. I will get paid in bitcoins, I will pay my bills in bitcoins. I will invest in bitcoins and I will secure my own Bitcoin investments. I will protect my monthly spending coins from volatility using a Bitcoin service and use a Bitcoin debit card everywhere bitcoins are not currently accepted. I am also working to establish some pure Bitcoin revenue streams next year. This is not my first leap of faith into the wonderful world of crypto-currencies. I am intentionally and with due diligence strapping myself to this moon rocket and daring the world to stop it. So please don't comment telling me how risky this is, I am well aware of the risks. This risk I take is mine and mine alone and the profit if it succeeds will be too. I have no dependents and I am still young. Win or lose it will be one hell of a ride.

Thank-you for reading and thank-you Satoshi.

Why not a racing game (on the Internet) like this:

The racing game starts with BAg: the bitcoin address of the game.

Player b inserts BAb: bitcoin address of player b

The games confirms that players with addresses BAa and BAb can play against each other and have to send say 0.01 bitcoin each.

Player a sends 0.01 bitcoin to BAg and player b sends 0.01 bitcoin to BAg.

The racing game starts and player b wins: the game now transfers the 0.02 bitcoin in address BAg to BAb, keeping maybe a small fee. Of course many more games like these are possible. Players anywhere in the world can play against each other.

65,"The limited supply of Bitcoins is seen as a good thing because it prevents inflation (or something).

But there is nothing stopping a country (the US, for example) from simply announcing that they will print no more money. So why don't they?

Some people want Bitcoin to be the only currency but it's built-in scarcity actually works against it in that sense. If you own 1% of all Bitcoins today (possible for early adopters who got in quick), you will still own 1% of all Bitcoins even if each Bitcoin is worth a million dollars and is the sole currency of the world. 

This actually creates a number of problems (like massive wealth inequality) but a very important one is money supply. If I hold onto that 1% of Bitcoin (or Satoshi's 5%), the global economy only has 99% of Bitcoin to play with. 

At the moment, you can't hoard USD because they can always print more. But you can (and people do) hoard Bitcoin. Why is this a good thing? How does Bitcoin deal with this issue? 

 "
66,"The current financial crisis started (actually: *became visible*) in late 2008 - coincidentally coinciding with the end of Bush's term.

https://www.google.com/search?output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=2008+financial+crisis&amp;btnG=

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail

*During 2008, the five largest U.S. investment banks either failed (Lehman Brothers), were bought out by other banks at fire-sale prices (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) or were at risk of failure and obtained depository banking charters to obtain additional Federal Reserve support (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). In addition, the government provided bailout funds via the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008.*

I have a theory that these crises nowadays tend to come every 8 years - when the current US president is on his way out (so he can let the next guy clean up the mess).

In other words: they no longer can fix the problems. So they just """"kick the can down the road"""" and let the poor sap on the next shift deal with it. 

Washington, issuer of the world's reserve currency the almighty military-backed petrodollar, quietly sweeps all the bad news under the rug for 8 years. 

Most US presidents get the maximum of two 4-year terms these days via reelection - so they end up serving a total 8 years.

Once those 8 years are over and the US President is getting ready to leave office - bam! that's when they let the shit hit the fan, since most of the current officeholders and employees (from the President and his appointees all the way down) won't have to be around anymore to clean up the mess.

As we all know, the financial news has been pretty grim on a regular basis these past few years. In particular: 

- They already blew their wad on QE1, QE2 and QE3 - so the next time the top """"too-big-to-fail"""" banks start to fail again... well we're already at ZIRP and some banks are even offering *negative* interest on savings accounts... so it's gonna be hard to do any more QE.

www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/negative-interest-rates

- There are now regulations in effect saying that the next time banks fail, there will be Cyprus-style """"bail-ins"""" a/k/a confiscation of *your* money - ie, as an account-holder, you will lose some of your money. (Technically, it's not even considered """"your money"""" anymore. Instead of a depositor, you're now like a bondholder in the bank - and a very, very junior bondholder at that. So get in line after the other, more senior creditors, Buddy!)

- Citigroup has been trying to sneak clauses into the current Federal budget to force the *taxpayers* to pay the *bankers* the next time the bankers lose while gambling at their global derivatives casino (currently over 1 *quadrillion* dollars, in nominal terms).

They know the ship's going down - and I predict they're conveniently timing it for mid- to late 2016 - when the current administration will be leaving office.

Hmm... what else is happening in late 2016?

Oh yeah: the Halvening!

http://bitcoinclock.com/

So fasten your seatbelts and get ready to ride out the perfect financial storm in 2016 - and until then, HODL!!!

PS - I don't give a *fuck* about """"merchant acceptance"""" of bitcoin. And hipsters who get excited when they can buy a tall latte with their bitcoin on their iPhone at Starbucks - *please* y'all gotta grow up, children.

As far as I'm concerned, bitcoin is like gold - to be hoarded for several years. 

And do *you* practice KYC/AML when you sell your bitcoin on an exchange? That's right, I didn't think you did. For all you know, that could be Jamie Dimon buying up all your bitcoin - trying to corner the market. You know he has an infinite fiat printing press, so what's it to him if he has to drop a cool $5billion to buy up everyone's bitcoins?

I'd recommend localbitcoins - face to face. Just to make sure it isn't some shady Wall Street character buying up your bitcoins. You know they're probably totally two-faced. On YouTube telling you: worthless fantasy unicorn internet money blah blah blah and meanwhile they're probably scooping up all they can on the exchanges while coins are still cheap.

Meanwhile, I ain't gonna buy no xbox or overpriced coffee by shaving off a piece of a gold coin. That shit's for my retirement.

Or at least until after the end of 2016.




"
67,"I know it's common on the site to suggest that people NOT give bitcoin as a gift.

I think there is a way to do it, and in the right context it works well.

People typically give it and present it as money. It's silly. Why would you give people more or less a gift card that they have to sign up for things to use, and can only be used in a limited number of places? This is almost worse than just a 1-store gift card. Plus they have fees... have to learn all about it... etc.  It's like handing somebody $50 in Yen and saying Merry Christmas. It kinda sucks in this context.

However, present it in the context of a lottery ticket. It's an emerging technology thing that could take off, but might not be worth anything. Let them ask questions.

**On top of this, would you like to get one big lottery ticket as your gift this year?** No. That gift would probably suck. So don't do that. Get something else that's a real gift, and get a small amount in btc if you would like.

This way, you can explain what it is in a way that makes them want to hold, may pique their interest in learning more about it, and, most importantly *sets an expectation of loss*.

Using this analogy should have MUCH better results then trying to give somebody btc as """"money""""."

72,"I know that 3rd party hosts like MtGox and others have been hacked, and there have been issues with poor random number generators and malware attacking individual users.

However, none of these situations has anything to do with the core bitcoin network itself.

To my knowledge the core bitcoin network has never been hacked and, so long as the individual solely controlled their secure private keys, no money ever lost.

If this is true, then in contrast to data breach on top of data breach over the last few years by traditional financial institutions, bitcoin is batting 1,000.

I know the media always confuses third party providers with the core protocol, but we don't have to make that mistake ourselves.

The Phillipines counts many overseas workers who remit money home to support their families. It's a huge market so I took the time to calculate the costs involved to transmit money home and my mind was blown by how cheap it is.

I made a screenshot of the info needed to calculate the fees to remit money to the Philippines.

http://imgur.com/aULG6Kf

Here is the calculation:

* The amount received is PHP 4,516.57
* The amount to be paid is 0.318473 BTC or 318 473 bits
* The current USD / PHP rate is 44.7255
* To buy 318 473 bits cost at that time was $314.32 x 0.318473 = $100,10 at Bitfinex
* Let's take into account a 0,30% fee at Bitfinex, so the cost is $100.1 x 1.003 = $100,40
* The amount of of PHP received is 4,471.57. Regarding the Yahoo Finance rate that is $4,471.57 / 44.7255 = $100,98
* **Total costs $100.40, total received $99.98!!!**

Important notes:

* These are the costs for sending money to a bank account. If you use a pickup service extra costs are involved, but are still much cheaper than the alternatives.
* For some transfers to a bank account there is an extra fee of $1, still much cheaper than the alternatives.
* The costs vary due to volatility but overall I've noticed the fees are between free and 1%.

Edit: I'm European and use euros to fund Kraken.com. The above calculation applies for Europeans using Kraken too. I have no idea if I've used the right example with Bitfinex or if there are alternatives like Coinbase or Bitstamp are better."

However, I went out to a place with a """"Trailblazer Promo"""" and recited the phrase from LibertyX's website, asking for a QPay PIN for LibertyX. The guy was a tiny bit confused at first, saying he should be able to do it but that he hadn't logged into QPay for a while. After a couple minutes, he had found it in their system. Unfortunately he informed me they didn't have any $50 PINs left, so I had to spring for a $100. (They come in 50/100/200/300). The guy was super nice, and printed out my receipt with the PIN no problem.

I got home, registered for LibertyX, and put in the PIN and wallet address I wanted it sent to. Within 5 minutes I had the bitcoins, pending confirmations from the blockchain. I emailed them about the Trailblazer promo, and they informed me that it was actually their fault the $50 PINs were out of stock, and promptly sent another $5 in BTC to the wallet I had used for the PIN in the first place.

So overall it was painless, easy, and fast! I definitely recommend at least trying it if there's a location near you."

100,"A new bitcoin node from Mike Hearn:

&gt; For those who didn't see it on the bitcoin-development list, I am now maintaining a patch set on top of Bitcoin Core.

&gt; It's called Bitcoin XT (for extras, extended, experimental, whatever) and currently adds two new features to the p2p protocol:

&gt;    getutxo, which is needed by Lighthouse and perhaps other apps that want to do a check on the validity of a tx without actually broadcasting it

&gt; Double spend relaying

&gt; The github link is here:

 &gt;   https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt

&gt; There are gitian-built code signed downloads for Linux, Mac and Windows (32/64 bit) so it should be easy to get started.

&gt; The point of this project is to provide a full node that has an explicit goal of supporting the needs of SPV app developers, as well as a place to try out more experimental changes in general. Through the course of 2013 I feel that the upstream Bitcoin Core project has become a relatively unpredictable place and I no longer feel sure that we can improve SPV mode or even that they will continue to support it at all. Bitcoin XT will always support SPV wallets.

&gt; I will rebase it from time to time. The current builds are based on Core 0.10 rc1 so they should download the block chain nice and fast, thanks to headers-first. If you run Core nodes, why not consider switching to XT! They use the same data directories so if you are already synced the switch is free.

&gt; If you do, please sign up for the announcement list:

&gt; https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-xt-announce

&gt; There's also a list for discussion of possible patches specifically:

&gt; https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-xt/

&gt; And finally, of course new features are no use if you can't find nodes implementing them! So I am now running a new crawler and DNS/HTTP seed here:

&gt; dnsseed.vinumeris.com
&gt; http://vinumeris.com:8081/peers.html    (drop the extension to get protobufs, or use .json/.xml)

&gt; You can query it for XT needs by adding ?srvmask=3&amp;getutxo to the url.

&gt; The crawler is brand new code so expect it to go up and down a lot as I make it stable."

102,I would like to know if there are any legitimate ways to get about ~$10 in Bitcoin to try out that doesn't require me to give them the last four of my social(Trucoin) or link a bank account(Coinbase). I'd be more comfortable doing that when I've had experience using the currency. I would just like to try it out with a VPN service that takes bitcoin as payment for a month.

103,"So, I'm a complete newbie to bitcoin and it completely amazes me!  But I must say, the single biggest barrier to joining the bitcoin community is **BUYING BITCOIN**

As far as I can tell, the best way to exchange $USD for BTC is through Coinbase..... That takes """"4 business days"""" essentially a week.... that's the single biggest thing I hate about bitcoin right now.


I feel like this could be a ridiculous proposal for a number of reasons, but I will make it anyway....  Is there any chance that there are members here with bitcoin that they would be willing to sell in small amounts?  I feel like the best way to get new people to """"buy in"""" to the idea of bitcoin is to spend """"Monopoly money"""" (i.e. $10-$30.  something that could be lost without the blink of an eye). 

I feel like some sort of """"small money exchange for entry bitcoin-ers"""" that is immediate would do wonders to peak the interest of people just looking to play around and learn the currency"
104,"Edit """"detailed thought"""":  Well considering the recent blowup of scam-amonia and doubts about the bitcoin foundation.  I feel a true and necessary action must be taken to preserve the fundamentals of Satoshi's vision.  To truly decentralize the power of influence of where bitcoin should go, I feel opening non-profit style centers around the world where people can actually stop in and learn about what really is the core of bitcoin....the blockchain itself.  Also these places will have chapters that can have a say within their concentrated hive brain as to solutions to bitcoin's upcoming problems.   Yes we have the antitrust algorithm for a reason, but I do feel that the mathematics can slowly influence the progression of how we approach these solution processes thought-wise (for example an observation of a 2014 blowout of businesses and ideas stressing open source-ness validity).
     What most people are overlooking is that(although I hate to admit a necessary evil) money is a big motivator to progress and now we also have technology to preserve faithfulness, trust and also an escape valve when things go sour.  All of these new approaches to the economy are phenomenal and now I feel that having some type of bitcoin chapters created around the globe can truly help people understand.  Online learning is great but to be honest....I learned about bitcoin when one of my friends sent me this magic internet money live..... phone to phone.  That's when I knew the world will never be quite the same.
"
105,"Title says it all. I'm working on an online trading card game. It's pretty early in development, but very much playable. I'd like it /r/Bitcoin would give it a try, considering it only accepts Bitcoin at the moment (I'll be adding PayPal support, in the future). 

Link to the website, **[here](http://forgotten-lore.com/)**.
Direct link to download the game, **[here](http://forgotten-lore.com/game/ForgottenLore-update.zip)**. 

**the game**- Forgotten Lore is an online trading card game that you can play with both friends and strangers. It's got a dedicated server setup, so you can do random matchmaking, trade cards with other players, duel specific people, and earn in game money (or purchase it via bitcoin, if you wish). I'm obviously biased, but I'd say the game is pretty fun. I've caught myself playing it with a friend while I should be debugging. 

**some background**- I'm a CS student at Oklahoma State University. While I'm here, I've been programming little video games here and there, mostly cross platform with Android and PC. This card game is my most recent project, and will probably be the biggest while I'm in College. 

**Technical stuff**- I used Bitcoinj to implement the bitcoin transactions myself, I didn't rely on any other system. When a user registers an account in the game client; it sends a message to a program which generates a private/public key for that user, and generates a QR code for the public key. It then adds the keys to the main server wallet and awaits a transaction. When the player wants to buy some in game gold; they are prompted with a [QR code](http://forgotten-lore.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bitcoin.png) (clicking on it copies the address to your clipboard). The program on the server will listen in, and if a transaction is made on that address, the amount is converted over to in game currency, and the transaction is complete. Later (after confirmations), the bitcoin is forwarded to an offline wallet.

116,"So I'm not a trader, I've never really done business with exchanges.  So I'm wondering, how exactly does an exchange become insolvent?  Maybe I'm thinking too simple, but an exchange simply holds your BTC and fiat, and facilitates the trade.  Excluding hacks or thefts, how do they lose the BTC or fiat that they're supposed to just be holding for you?

Edit - thanks.  Long story short -- theft, fractional reserves, bad software/human error.  Basically I was trying to understand if there was any legitimate business reason how they could become insolvent since they *should* just be facilitating trades and not taking anything except fees.  Answer seems to be no."

* they don't know how they were compromised

* they hastily migrated to an entirely new infrastructure without time for penetration testing or a security audit

* they are insolvent

If any of the above three statements are true, we should be sounding the alarm. I cannot believe people are not demanding answers to these questions.

118,"Hi!
I happen to be UX person and also a newbie fan of Bitcoin.

Beside the fact that it can be a revolutionary technology, in my opinion it is also very user-un-friendly in some aspects. One of them are **bitcoin addresses**. They're (by most people) **impossible to remember and to compare**.

QR codes made it easy for mobile devices to copy the exact addresses. Nevertheless, in case of pasting them  (or worse - typing them manually!) on desktops - it is quite uncomfortable, and can sometimes give this unpleasant feeling of uncertainty whether they have been entered correctly. Am I alone?

I'd rather avoid mistakes (copying wrong address), typos and hypothetical malware that is changing copied addresses. I usually check just several digits, but that may not be the best solution.

**Example of the problem:**

Are this 18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ and this 18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcC1jnzKWEg5VZ addresses identical?
They're not and it is also impossible to tell it at a glance.


So that's my idea of improving this experience - **bitcoin address color swatches** as a reduced, graphical representation of actual addresses but **easy to distinguish and compare by human eye** instantly; because it's waaay easier to do it with colors than long numbers.
I'd suggest limiting the number of colors to 4 (definietely not more than 7).

It can be done eg. by:

1) Hashing the address

2) Slicing it into pieces

3) Converting each piece into several colors (and/or numbers)


**Dirty proof of concept of the solution:**

Compare color swatches of this address:
[18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ](http://smietnik.xon.pl/bacs/index.html?address=18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ) and this one: [18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcC1jnzKWEg5VZ](http://smietnik.xon.pl/bacs/index.html?address=18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcC1jnzKWEg5VZ)

See the difference? Easier?

I can imagine a situation where something like this becomes a standard for most wallet/transaction software so it's just easier for people to visually compare and identify the addresses.

What do you think?

Mercurial repo if somebody's interested in the code (beware, very ugly code inside!): https://bitbucket.org/BishKopt/bitcoin-address-color-swatches

**tl;dr**

I'm suggesting graphical representation of bitcoin addresses that will help humans identify and compare them ([example](http://smietnik.xon.pl/bacs/index.html?address=18D5tD7y10zwjHvY7JTYnbcCIjnzKWEg5VZ))."

127,"**We can show** with game theory that there is an equilibrium that could drag mining to a crawl. - Here's how:

Let's say there is someone (*Mr X*) who controls 10% of the mining pool. Let's also refer to a block-duration at a set difficulty as an """"*era*"""". (Sorry not sure the correct term).

Mr X mines, then during one era (call it era 1) he stops mining.

This drops the difficulty during era 2, when he mines again. This means the difficulty during era 3 is higher, when he again stops mining. He gets to mine during lower difficulties and stops mining during higher difficulties.

Because of the knife-edge of profitability, and his relatively large mining power (though crucially nowhere near 51%) other rational miners will spot the pattern and also only mine during *even* eras, it doesn't make sense for them to mine the harder to get coins.

This causes further difference between the """"easy"""" short eras and the """"hard"""" long eras. The wilder the swings, the more sense it makes to only mine during the short eras. You get the same average reward as the long era (your % of the total mining power of the blocks) but your electricity is only on for the short era.

Game theory says that everyone should join this miner in their strategy. Eventually there won't be any mining during the hard blocks which will cause it to last forever.

edit: In fact, the """"Mr X"""" need not even be a person, he could be a group of rational actors responding to a price change.

Mining could really destabilize going forward."

So I've been actively following Bitcoin since mid 2012, mainly as a storage of investments, etc. It's been a great ride and my understanding of the nature of the world has changed so much thanks to cryptocurrency. There are a lot of inspirational people in this community and I am proud to be a part of it, especially as it evolves.

I feel it is time to take things to the next stage though - I want to start contributing to various projects, as well as a few of my own ideas I have floating around in my head.

Where do I start? What are the best programming languages to learn to directly use Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies?

For example, just having a website that allows people to pay / have accounts in Bitcoin. I know this is already available with Bitpay and Wordpress plugins but I want to learn from the ground up. It is the only way I will have a true understanding.

(Apologies for bad English, not my first language).

162,I'm writing to a tutorial to help people who may have sent some bitcoins without spending a transaction fee and now have to wait forever for their confirmation.

163,"I was using a VPN and logged into my online banking site. The IP was flagged in their system as malicious. They locked my account and I had to call them. They closed my account and created a new one. Now I have to wait for my card to arrive, for my funds to be transfered, and for my new checks before I can pay my rent that was due yesterday. Before this they locked my account because the debit card was returned to them even though they had the right address on file. Before that they locked my account because I bought bitcoin and a VPN. Before this I was with another bank that charged me a series of cascading overdraft fees totaling $300 because I went $1 below my balance.

I've had enough. I've got to find an alternative but bitcoin is too volatile. I'm thinking of using bitusd, shape shift and maybe anx bitcoin debit card? However, I'm not sure how much trust I can put in bitusd to safe guard my wealth from volatility, shape shift to reliably convert to bitcoin, and anx to not lock my debit card or charge me insane fees?

*During February 13-17, 2015, we will be having an election for two individual board seats. In order to be eligible to vote in these elections, you have to be an individual member (industry membership does not count).

If you are an industry member but would like to vote, you will need to become an individual member. Individual memberships are $25/year or $250/lifetime. To join, visit https://bitcoinfoundation.org/join/

If you are not sure if your membership is active, please email membership@bitcoinfoundation.org. 

If you need to renew your membership, you can do so here: https://bitcoinfoundation.org/join/

Today (Friday, Feb 6) is the last day to join or renew your membership to be eligible for this election.

**Also, as per our bylaws, members who wish to participate in voting need to confirm their status as active members.  For further information on why, see this pull request.**

I want to vote, how do I confirm myself as an active member

Simple.  Login to https://members.bitcoinfoundation.org, click on the “Election” tab, and follow the on screen instructions.

When is the deadline to confirm myself as an active member?
Please note that new members must join by February 6th to get voting rights. February 10th is the last day for current members to confirm as an active member. After that we cannot guarantee that you’ll receive a ballot, but we will try.

Where can I find out more information about the election?
You can find more information by reading this blog post.

The confirmed and final list of candidates eligible for an individual board seat will be announced in an elections mailing next week. Stay tuned!*

Essentially, you need to

1) make sure your membership is not expired
2) make sure your email address is confirmed
3) confirm your status as an eligible member (membership portal, different account than the Forum)
4) receive further instructions? (still unclear as to how members will vote but it seems it will be through an email)"

I was kind of surprised, since we hadn't talked about Bitcoin in a while, so I asked her why she decided to pick up another one. Here's what she said: 

&gt;  I've been reading about some investments and actions that are starting to pull bitcoins into the public eye and gain traction.  Plus, the price is really attractive right now, so I thought I would invest a bit more.  I'm still a little fuzzy about getting the money back out, but that's a future conversation for us.

Now before the trolls jump in here asserting that bitcoin is no better and it's just as tainted and corrupt and so on, I'd rather use money that is globally transferable, globally transparent and un-seizable than a currency that can be equated with capitalistic consumeristic slave credits, printed at whim and inflating wildly out of control in a grand concerted effort to crash this geopolitical house of cards into a pile of rubble.

I am relatively new to the Bitcoin space (recently completed a MOOC instructed by Andreas Antonpolous) and am super excited to learn as much as I can about digital currencies. I had one question that may be somewhat elementary, but regardless I would like have a better understanding of. Bitcoin is a fixed currency, with it's distribution occurring on a predictable basis. Now my question is: if exchanges convert fiat currency into Bitcoins, again a limited supply, is it possible for an exchange to simply """"run-out"""" of Bitcoins if demand were to suddenly skyrocket? Furthermore, for an exchange to exist, would it have to have a sizable amount Bitcoin prior to inception for it properly function?

196,"From an outsider's perspective, what Bitcoin price target does the Bitcoin community believe in?  $1,000 per coin?  $10,000 per coin?  $100,000 per coin?  Whatever it may be, let us do our part to help make it more well-defined in order to establish clearer consensus.
  
As such, what clear set of reasons can we agree on, focus on, and promote in order to most beneficially educate and shape the behavior of supply and demand acting in the market?
  
In my opinion, a clear, simple, and easily repeatable case exists for pricing Bitcoin similarly to gold.  Bitcoin is above and beyond gold in many respects, but the bitcoin/gold comparison is an easy anchor point from which to reasonably discuss Bitcoin as a mulltiple trillion dollar market-cap player.

Reasoning:
  
1.  Today, I can more easily purchase, store, and transfer Bitcoin than I can gold.  
  
2.  While gold's historical role as a store of value is impressive and well-established, Bitcoin is more scarce than gold.  Bitcoin is more divisible than gold.  Bitcoin is more easy to transport than gold.  Bitcoin is more verifiable than gold.  And, in terms of its trans-continental transactability, Bitcoin-the-network is more durable than gold-the-network.
  
3.  In 2013, about $320 million of gold was mined per day.  Presently, about 3600 bitcoins are mined each day.  In terms of new money flow, this suggests that a base price of about $88,888 per bitcoin can be supported, if Bitcoin were valued similarly to gold.  Interestingly, $88,888 per bitcoin equates to a Bitcoin market cap of only $1.2 trillion (counting 21 million bitcoins), whereas the total market cap of all 6 billion ounces of gold estimated to be in circulation is currently around $7.2 trillion.  This suggests, in terms of overall supply, that a price of about $340,000 per bitcoin can be supported, if Bitcoin were valued similarly to gold.
  
Let us agree on Bitcoin's superiority to gold and make publicly known our unified, well-reasoned base target price of $88,888 per bitcoin.

197,I'm hosting a FIFA tournament this weekend and I like to see if there is a way I can effectively pool the money into 1 wallet for the winner of the tourney. Any ideas?
198,"I'm building a wallet which has a """"Confirm transaction"""" pane which displays the destination Bitcoin address after the user scans a Bitcoin QR code, and the user should check the address is correct.

For usability purposes, I only want to display as many characters as necessary - and no more - to not compromise security. My idea is to only display the first few characters, enough to guarantee that no attacker could create an address with the same first characters and dupe the user to send funds to his address.

According to [this Vanitygen page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Vanitygen_keysearch_rate), an AMD Radeon 58XX or 68XX GPU can search through 23.5 Mkey/s. Assuming an attacker is really well equipped, and can do 25 Gkey/s for a whole year, then an attacker can search through `25*10^9*60*60*24*365` keys.

Since Bitcoin addresses are represented in base58 (disregarding the first character in a Bitcoin address being fixed to 1 or 3), if I show 12 characters after the first character, then the probability of an attacker succeeding is [0.054% according to my calculations](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+%28%2858%5E12+-+1%29%2F58%5E12%29%5E%2825*10%5E9*60*60*24*365%29).

I think the porn industry could really make great use of bitcoin by giving their customers the option to download / stream individual movies from their directories. So if you would prefer to just watch one video you could send a small payment of say 50c instead of buying a monthly subsribtion.

I NEVER pay for porn and im sure the majority of people probably dont either, especially when there are plenty of free streaming sites out there, but lets face it the quality of these are sh*t.

I would actually be willing to pay on the top level production sites if i had this option. You could then scroll through their catrgories, pornstarts etc, view a quick 30 second preview and then bam bitcoin sent and its happy time! No one wants to be locked into an invasive recurring credit card contract/bill especially when its associated with porn.

The porn industry grosses as much as $14 billion annually and i think it would profit even more if it utilized anonymous micro transactions. Just think about what an industry that big could also do to help bitcoin boom.

214,"Still have BTC with CaVirtex that is locked down and I can't get it out. The buy/sell prices at CaVirtex right now are about $271 CAN per coin. The price on any other exchanges right now is about $317 CAN per coin. I notice many big buy orders on CaVirtex for about $265 or so when many customers are like me and can't even withdrawal their coins anyway. Who is making these big buys and why? Is it CaVirtex themselves preying on their customers before shut down to make a quick buck? I am sure they can enable their own BTC withdraws and if doing so that is a difference of about $52 CAN per coin traded on another exchange if they were taking advantage of their customers. Just speculation, but why would regular customers be putting in buy orders for like 100 coins that they can't even sell and can't withdrawal."
215,"Intel Just floated two very interesting job postings...
Preamble to both:
&gt;Job Description: Digital currencies like Bitcoin have captured the imagination of the press. Related startups are generating a great deal of VC interest and investment because of the potential significance of any disruption of the financial payment industry. Its fundamental technical innovation is the decentralized transaction ledger called the 'block-chain'. It allows bitcoin to prevent double-spending of currency by recording all transactions in an open ledger without the need for a central authority. Such a distributed, public, secure, peer-to-peer transaction record enables not just the exchange of bitcoins but many secondary uses that the research and startup community are exploring such as digital marketplaces. 

[Distributed Systems Researcher - 756187](https://intel.taleo.net/careersection/10000/jobdetail.ftl?job=756187)
&gt;The Special Innovation Projects group within Intel Labs is looking for a researcher to investigate hardware and software capabilities that advance the performance, robustness, and scalability of open, decentralized ledgers. Working with a team of distributed systems, operating systems, and security technologists, you will conduct research on distributed system architectures that build on Intel trusted execution capabilities to deliver robust, reliable, Internet-scale decentralized transactions.

Now its asking me to confirm my email, with a note that this will be a one time thing, and I thought. """"Wait a second... I already did this. What is going on?""""

218,"I received an email today of a fraud alert on my credit card.  Four Netflix charges that looked fraudulent. Now I get the pleasure of receiving a new card with a new number, and I get to notify all of my auto-payers of the new number.

Over the course of the past six month or so, I have had them replace the cards to give me new security features (chip embedded) - with a new number.  Then they issued new cards, and implied that they were doing it due to the Target breach.  Then they replaced again, and insinuated it was due to the Home Depot breach.  And then I noticed a bogus Spotify (99 cent) charge on the card.  Then they sent me a fraud alert on a card that I literally have in a vault - only used for a cash advance.  Now another fraud alert on my main card.

219,"The TL/DR version is this: Satoshi made some design choices for Bitcoin that are more-or-less arbitrary, such as a hard limit of 21 million coins, block awards that diminish and a 10 minute block time, all of which could potentially hold Bitcoin back from taking over the world, IMO... I know why Bitcoin devs stick to those concepts, as they are what define Bitcoin, in a sense... But wonder why there isn't much discussions on those points, and why few Alt-Coin developers have the courage to deviate from those concepts, either.

243,"My thinking here is probably incorrect, but if bitcoin supply is capped to 21 million coins, then  the only way for bitcoin to become a mainstream form of payment or replace the current fiat system is for the value of a coin to go way, way up.

Even if a coin is worth $1000, that puts market cap at $21 billion. If 1 billion people use bitcoin, they only have an average worth of $21...

So that gives 3 options:

1 - Bitcoin value goes way higher, to like $10k+ per coin (unlikely imo)

2 - The cap of bitcoin gets raised (I don't know too much about the technology but believe it's not possible to increase the cap?)

3 - Bitcoin fails

247,"OKCoin has decided to openly share cold wallet security information. Through this transparency, OKCoin aims to assure users of the security of their funds. We hope this helps the industry be more open and welcome feedback and new ideas. 

Our security design philosophy

1. Any equipment connected to the internet is inherently vulnerable.
2. USB drives are unsafe as USB disks may be compromised with viruses. Such a USB virus may automatically record data in a computer network after it's inserted and steal the contents within.
3. No security practice can be reliant on one individual. Any access to cold wallet must require confirmation of two authorized parties.
4. Everyone has the potential to suffer from an unexpected event. Others need to be authorized to access offsite backups in order to ensure safety.
5. Individuals may be kidnapped, so important data must be saved in the highest security bank safe and require in-person access.

Our security design protocol

Private key generation and backup

1. Generate 10,000 private keys and corresponding address on the completely offline computer.
2. Add AES private key encryption on the completely offline computer.
3. Delete the original 10,000 private keys.
4. AES password to be controlled by two OKCoin company personnel in separate locations - one in OKCoin's Beijing office, one in a city on the West Coast of the United States.
5. The two AES master password holders cannot use the same means of transportation at the same time.
6. The address and encrypted private key on the offline computer are displayed in QR code format.
7. The QR code of the address is scanned by another computer to publish the address of the cold wallet in order to receive deposits from our hot wallet. Each cold wallet address will be used only once.
8.The QR code of the encrypted key is printed and stored inside a highly secure bank vault. Even if the holder of the encrypted key was kidnapped, the document is secure as the holder must be present at the bank to retrieve it.
9. The QR code of the encrypted key is stored and backed up - one in the bank safe in China, and another in a city on the East coast of the United States.
10. Access to these two banks are granted to two separate people.
11. These two people do not take transportation together.
12. Those with access to the bank safes cannot be the same as the ones who control the AES password.

Depositing bitcoins from online hot wallet to offline cold wallet

1. Once public address of cold wallet is retrieved, deposits of bitcoins can be made from the hot wallet. For security reasons, each address cannot exceed 1,000 bitcoins.
2. Each address will also no longer be used after a single outbound transaction.

Retrieving bitcoins from offline cold wallet

1. Send personnel to the bank safe near the office and retrieve the appropriate number of unused encrypted private keys. Scan the QR code of these keys into an offline computer.
2. The QR code is scanned into another completely offline computer.
3. The holder of the AES master password decrypts the encrypted private key on a completely offline computer.
4. The private key is scanned using QR code to import into another entirely offline computer.
5. Signing trading on another computer completely offline, and after the transaction signature synchronized to a computer with internet broadcast transaction through USB drive.

Highlights of the OKCoin security protocol

1. The cold wallet addresses can only hold a limited amount of Bitcoins.
2. Private keys are stored on completely offline computers.
3. Certainty that the private key never had any contact with the internet or USBs.
4. Encrypted private key paper document requires offsite backup, and is controlled by different people in different places.
5. AES private key password shall also be controlled by different people in different places, and shall not be the same person with the master of the private key.
6. Holders of the AES private key password and those with the ability to retrieve the encrypted private key are different people and in different places.
7. Once a private key has been used to transfer Bitcoin out of the address, the address is no longer to be used again for deposits.

Targets that our security protocol hopes to achieve

1. Cold wallet Bitcoins spread across multiple private keys.
2. Accessing any private key requires two people - the holder of the AES password, and the holder of the bank safety deposit box.
3. There are backups for both the AES password and holder of the bank safety deposit box spread geographically. In the case of unexpected events, bitcoins are still safe.
4. Encrypted private keys are kept in bank vaults. Even if any personnel is kidnapped, the victim cannot be forced to obtain access to bitcoins.
5. Each cold address can only be transferred once and the address will be void thereafter."
248,"Hi

With today's Bitcoin price, most of you think it's quite difficult to find a miner that will pay back for itself in less than a few months. 

What you do not realize is that you carry the most profitable and efficient in your pocket every day. Yes, I am talking about your smartphone. 

Before you call me crazy, hear me out. There is an app for iOS and Android (4.1+ if I'm not mistaking) called """"Perk TV"""". You make points for watching videos. No worries, the videos play automatically. 1,000 = $1. 

My $20 Walmart Android phones make me $1 a day each. That's just 20 days to pay back for itself. You will not find a Bitcoin miner like that. 

After you accumulated enough points, you go to Perk's other app called """"Perk Wallet"""" and redeem your points for Bitcoin via Coinbase. The only problem is that there is a fee. Remember how I said 1,000 points = $1? That's for the gift cards. For Bitcoin it's 25,000 points = $20 of BTC etc. (the fee increases as you redeem for more Bitcoin, but the % doesn't change). 

I wish you all luck. If you want to help me out, use my referral code when you first sign up for Perk TV - 2441b496. I will receive 500 points when you first redeem for a reward. 

If you have any questions of need tips, PM me. Have a great werkend. "
249,"I'm done.  
  
I'm done trying to convince friends and family that they need to find a few hundred extra dollars in their budget for a bitcoin or two...  *just in case*.  
  
People that outright dismiss bitcoin and refuse to buy them based on principal?  I don't agree, but I understand.  It's a difference of opinion.  
  
But what irks me are the many friends and family I have that not only understand bitcoin, but admit that yeah, it's probably going to take over everything.  
  
""""Great,"""" I say.  """"You know if every millionaire in the US alone wanted some, they could have about two each?  Why don't you just buy one a month for the next few months, just in case it's all true.  We both just agreed it looks more and more likely to happen.""""   
  
**Cue the excuses.**  
  
In December it was """"oh, Christmas is coming...  My kids need tons of plastic toys they will promptly break and forget about.""""  
  
""""Dude, you realize that every couple of those toys are going to cost you untold thousands in the future, right? """"  
  
And the excuses never end...  Someone has to retile their bathroom, there just isn't any money!  Someone else has to move to a larger apartment...  Maybe he will find some money when tax season comes around...  Another just doesn't have it..  Money is *so tight*!  
  
I'm here, very well paid, with the ability to live a very comfortable life.  And yet, many nights I am eating ramen noodles and drinking cheap vodka when I want a buzz.   Know why?  So I can afford (squeeze) another bitcoin in the budget each month.  
  
And you're telling me you can't scrape up $300 from somewhere?  One person had enough to buy three bitcoins, but just couldn't stomach the thought they might buy and the price of bitcoin might drop... Please...  Go back to unicorn and rainbow land...  What is with this latest generation of men who can't stomach the idea of risk?   
  
And this is why there will always be debt slaves...  Most of the population is too scared to risk their comfort for a chance at something greater...  Even when the outcome is nearly assured in their eyes!  
  
They would rather buy some superfluous silliness now instead of saving their money in what is assuredly a once in a century opportunity... It is very sad, but I am realizing that I cannot help them.  
  
Something something about a horse to water and drinking.  
  
Oh well, I'll just stack my Bitcoins and lay low.  And I know in five to ten years when the price of a single coin is astronomical, those same people will lament how the universe has shit on them...  """"Ohhhh, I knew about it too but I just didn't have any money...  Poor me... Hey, AP, you bought a bunch... I remember you were the one who told me about them... Can you help me out?""""  
  
NO."
250,"They are batches of transactions linked in sequential order, or in other words, they are simple ledgers. Ledgers have been around for centuries. There is nothing revolutionary about a """"blockchain"""" managed by trusted entities, it's in fact ridiculously antiquated. That is what we already have. 

Bitcoin's blockchain or ledger is special because it is collectively managed with no trusted entities i.e. it's decentralized, and the units are predictably limited in supply. All of bitcoins benefits cheaper, faster, open, more secure, etc stem from this and nothing else. To fail to understand this is to fail to understand the promise of bitcoin. 

"

Naturally, I assume their interest in utilizing BTC was influenced by the price, but now that the decline appears to have stabilized I wonder if they're still considering the idea. 


Of course, we should all """"just use Bitcoin and not exchange it into fiat"""" but this is unrealistic until BTC's market volume is several orders of magnitude larger and the Blockchain and sidechains have been outfitted with improved code to manage drastically higher transaction frequency.


So, in the meantime, I believe it would be a benefit to use some of our existing financial infrastructure to make Bitcoin more accessible, while still keeping it affordable to transact between crypto and fiat currencies.

Hey ####,

My name is #### and I'm with the Customer Experience team. Thank you for your inquiry about bitcoin as a payment/payout option. Right now, we sadly don't have any plans to add bitcoin anywhere in the near future. I'm personally not too familiar with bitcoin, but I imagine it must be similar in nature to PayPal. As such, I imagine it would be a very convenient alternative to use on our site for certain users. Although we do not have that listed as an option right now, PayPal is the fastest method we have when it comes to payments in general. So, if you're looking for speed, I would suggest possibly trying that out.

We are always accepting feedback on how to improve our site in all aspects. As such, if you would like, I can send up your feedback to our technical team that works on improving the site. If you'd like me to do that, just let me know. Or if you have any other questions, also let me know that. Thanks!

Best wishes,

But with proof: http://maddoge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Day-of-MAD-proof.jpg

It's been stable, yes it runs DogeCoin, the BitCoin revision will require another Raspberry Pi 2 (I'm not made of pi-es)

Am I crazy to think we don't need custom hardware?



Look, I'm no business, I'm just a college student who spent the last year learning linux enough to do this, yes I did follow tutorials in the past, but all those efforts were clunky and failed. I now know a few tricks and this is the result. Sorry for taking over a year, I'm not a full-time or paid developer.

Edit: I do plan on sending out copies of it, but on preloaded microsd cards (but not charging an arm-and-a-leg), since hosting the file is too expensive for me. ($1.60 every time someone downloads and I have no idea how to charge magic internet money to pay for that). It's far more efficient for me to load it onto an SD card for each major improvement (and include a tutorial for those who want to do it manually - for bit-core releases).

Nonetheless, each MicroSD card I send out has a fully working blockchain that is within 1 month of the current chain. Minimal time to get current. (Tested and it works!)

I hope you enjoy it, do understand that I will do a Bitcoin one eventually, DogeCoin was just easier to test with."

It worked, but I figured I would put the rest on the wallet because I didn't have much BTC anyways. The mobile wallet generated another address code but I thought it may do that for security (now that doesnt make sense) so I put in that address to send the BTC to from my exchange wallet and I havent recieved the 40 dollars. It says on the site it should take around 10 minutes (although can take up to 8 hours). Was my mobile wallet hacked and I sent it to some random persons address instead of my own?

287,"CodeCloud.me, the online education and crowdsourcing platform, has a new program within their website that allows users to get paid to learn how to code. It’s called the “Bitcoin Trader”. Coders from around the world are signing up to learn how to do high frequency trading in the multi-billion dollar Bitcoin market. The platform accepts students at no cost and pairs them into team based on their capabilities. You can be an absolute newbie at programming to get started!

Once you’re logged in, you join a “Bitcoin Trader” fleet, where you are matched with a mentor and 6 to 10 other users. You then follow interactive video tutorials and work with your team members through CodeCloud.me to build your Bitcoin trading bot.

The program does not guarantee that students will earn revenue from their Bitcoin trading activities; however, they stress that students who are highly active and contribute meaningful work will be invited to join profitable teams if unsatisfied with their groups’ results on the platform. Before users trade their own money, CodeCloud.me allows users to trade using the website's own capital if users can exhibit profitable results in simulations.

This program began running approximately one month ago and already has over one hundred users currently developing Bitcoin trading bots. 

Anyone can join online; however, physical classes for the Bitcoin trading program is held in-person at the Bitcoin Center in the Itaewon Neighborhood of Seoul.
"
288,"Just an observation I have made:

The block time of bitcoin essentially puts a ceiling on the velocity of bitcoin in on-chain transactions, as 1 BTC could be used in a maximum of 6 x 24=144 transactions per day. Assuming that transactions are not widely considered verified to respend until 6 confirmations, this is reduced further to a maximum of 24 transactions per day at most.

This essentially means that the value per BTC must rise greater than otherwise (if there were no such limit imposed on velocity by the protocol) if BTC becomes widely adopted. As the monetary theory of money states

M x V = P x Q

M is limited per the protocol to the current maximum supply of BTC, which will eventually be 21 million, but also
V is limited as above to 24 transactions per day

So M x V has a maximum value, no matter how large the BTC economy grows to eventually (Q). As Q grows, P (price level) must shrink, i.e. deflation."

294,"Tell me, what is it?

I believe that at some point in the future, it will become the global currency of the world. Not only is it better than traditional currency, it's better than traditional currency and gold combined. It's essentially gold, cash, and the credit card system all rolled into one. It integrates the strengths of each, but leaves the weaknesses behind. 

It has the limited supply quality of gold, but can be used to purchase everyday items. It has the convenience of a credit card, but uses a highly secure network where transactions occur instantly. Like cash, it doesn't require sensitive information to be shared, but it's not an attractive currency to use for illegal purposes since transactions are recorded on a public ledger (*criminals will eventually learn*). Now I ask you, what is it?

Not sure yet? Here are more clues.

- Unlike currencies, you will always know the exact quantity that will ever exist
- Unlike currencies, the threat of currency devaluation by increasing the money supply does not exist as governments / banks do not control the number of units that exist
- Unlike gold, it is easily and perfectly divisible
- Unlike gold, it is easily transferred from one party to another
- Unlike gold, storage costs are minimal and nonrecurring
- Unlike credit cards, there is no risk of identity theft when making a purchase (*as this information is not provided / needed*)
- Unlike credit cards, there is no threat of fraud or charge-backs (*once received, it's yours*)
- Unlike credit cards, there is little to no cost in transferring funds from one party to another (*CC companies typically charge merchants around 3% to transact within their network*)
- Unlike banks and credit cards, transactions are settled in minutes and seconds, rather than """"business days""""
- Unlike banks and other money transfer systems, there is little to no cost for sending funds outside of the country. (*Banks typically assess a wire transfer fee of around $30*)

Now you tell me. Does this currency / commodity / technology hybrid have a future? Does this sound like something that could evolve into the predominant worldwide currency / money transfer system in the world? If so, learn about it, understand the proper security measures to ensure safe storage, and be prepared to witness the greatest financial innovation that has ever occurred.

Today we made an [announcement](https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/04/07/introducing-bitcoin-hackathon-v2/) on our blog saying that we're giving away $20k of bitcoin to people building bitcoin apps (a hackathon), along with some other stuff (Boost.VC investment to the winner, guest judges, etc). Not an earth shattering announcement by any means, but overall a positive thing for the bitcoin community that will generate some cool new apps and developer interest.

Yet you probably never heard about it.

The first post on /r/bitcoin which went live linked to our blog post.
http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31s4gz/introducing_the_bitcoin_hackathon_v2/

Combined up and down votes came to a total of 0, along with a nice """"Fuck off Coinbase"""" message.

Some media decided to write about the hackathon, and thinking the above situation was sort of strange, I went ahead and posted a link to one of the articles:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31son1/adam_draper_fred_wilson_and_gavin_andresen_to/

Same thing happend: 2 upvotes and and a nice """"fuck off Coinbase"""" message by the same throw away account.

This is especially surprising if you consider that last year when we ran the exact same Hackathaon, it got 289 upvotes. http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1xu0ot/coinbase_launches_bithack_an_online_bitcoin/

Seems pretty obvious it would get upvotes. You don't even have to use the Coinbase API at all - you can literally build any cool app that uses bitcoin in any way and we will give you free money. The outrage!

I've been trying to think about how this happened. My only theories are:

**1. Reddit voting ring detection is busted and is downvoting us incorrectly**

There are a bunch of Coinbase employees in one office behind a single IP, and some of them might have upvoted it (although we discourage this in case it triggers voting ring detection). I can't imagine more than a few Coinbase employees upvoted it, if any, before it got downvoted though, so I'd be a little surprised if this was the case.

**2. There are bots or trolls actively down voting Coinbase stuff**

This seems plausible given the throw away account chiming in on both posts.  But they would need (I assume) more than a troll or two to actively down it into oblivion.

**3. There is some other explanation I haven't considered**

I have noticed that a lot of our posts that make it to /r/bitcoin have very binary outcomes - either they sail to the front page and get upvoted to the moon, or some trolls snag the first few votes, and it never sees the light of day.

Anyway, if there is some other theory I would love to hear it - it would really suck if people were figuring out ways to manipulate reddit's voting for any purpose.  Even if you don't like Coinbase, hopefully we can all get behind preventing voting rings (and giving money to bitcoin developers).

So...what the gosh darn heck is going on?

316,"Hello,

We would like to introduce ourselves to the community as OCD JERKY, “Premium quality handcrafted beef”.  We admire the bitcoin community and would love to be apart of something special. After getting our business close to commercial production, we though it would be a good idea to check in and establish a friendly relationship with the community. 

We started this thread to talk about the role bitcoin will play in our business, how we can better ourselves with bitcoin and to get some community feedback. We want to know your thoughts and suggestions on how we can improve our business with bitcoin. It is an amazing technology that will change the world forever. Personally, I am a bitcoin fan that has spent the past couple years obsessed with BTC and anything crypto related.


**A bit about us:**

We are a small startup located in Perth, Western Australia. Our company is devoted to making premium quality beef jerky. We do not add any artificial colours, flavours or preservatives. Only the finest herbs, spices and sauces are used to flavour prime Aussie beef. Marinated for 24hrs and charcoal filter air dried. The result is a delicious artisan beef snack. It is unlike other products and will become a market leader. The jerky is unique and with a small popular product, it is easy to ship worldwide. Bitcoin will play a central role in our payments allowing us to conduct frictionless cross border transactions. It is our preferred payment method that we can be certain there will be no reversals or associated fraud.

**Positive adoption:**
 
Our series 1 packaging (140k units) has the famous B on the back that will be seen by over 140,000 people! Our next batch will contain more information and even refer to an appropriate site, perhaps bitcoin.org. Curious snackers can learn about bitcoin and even find out how to get there hands on some. We have thrown a few ideas around and thought to drop loaded paper wallets in random packaging for lucky people. Its quite an incentive to learn about bitcoin when you have a few in your packet! Were open to ideas and can rapidly adapt our business module to accommodate. The bitcoin community has access to OCD and were listening. What can we do to help? 

**Integration:**

As you know OCD JERKY is crazy about bitcoin and we want to accept btc inside our online store! Right now we don’t know how to do this. Our site is with Squarespace and their integration is some time off. We chose them because they have nice layouts that are simple to use. After building the site, we find we can’t integrate BTC into the cart. For now we decided to set up an OTC thread and manually conduct trades on bitcointalk. It may be inefficient but it is a great opportunity to make some friends and build our reputation. 

We need your help! We have looked into the options but can’t find a solution. So far we see a number of approaches that can embed a buy button or form although these options don’t allow users to select multiple items to cart. Go coin, coinbase and bitpay have been investigated but these only allow the single unit buy button as I can see. Did I miss something? Remember that with Squarespace we can’t simply plug-in a shopping cart and add BTC as payment. Stripe BTC is not yet implemented there. They really have made it hard!

We also started building a site with wordpress but found it too difficult. We had to allocate the time back to the production schedule and make do with our current site. I do agree, if we had the skills WP would be optimal design/SEO.

317,"Bitnational is not a community based service at all. These guys are trying to centralize and commercialize Bitcoin with Wave's coffee. AND Why? They are trying to steal the locations of previous bitcoin businesses in Calgary and Vancouver! Use wave's corporate structure to evict existing bitcoin brokerages ie The Bitcoiniacs in  Vancouver and The Bitcoin Brains in Calgary. Then Bitnational wants to then steal all the clients and business activities that follow suit! 2 oil and gas guys with very little business and Bitcoin experience. Customer service is appalling and Matt is very offsetting. He talks to customer like a cave man and I would not trust him with my money EVER.  This kind of business practice is not acceptable in any field and I'm sure the community will see right threw their bullshit, poor business skills and shitty business practices. I am friends with the Bitcoiniacs and bitcoinbrains and I thought I should share their story!

318,"“Bitcoin has the potential to be a massively disruptive technology,” I’d been paying attention to Bitcoin because a couple of other people that Wences had talked with, like Katana Capital founder Charlie Songhurst, had also talked to me about it and said that it was very important. No one had made the argument in a way that stuck yet, but it made me curious. I started to really think about it, so I sought out Wences in the summer of 2013. We had a fairly thorough conversation. He articulated very strong positive theories about Bitcoin and I began to feel empowered.

331,"Hi reddit,

My name is Abby, I am a enthusiastic Bitcoin web developer in Taiwan. I love Bitcoin, because it helps solved many human problems in our society because we are so rely on the banks.

Let me tell you a little story with my poor English, it's a story happened in my trip in the U.S. this February:

After a terrible 4 hours flight delay after my Creating Change Conference in Denver, I arrived in SFO, and catched the very last train (BART) to downtown San Francisco, it's where my hotel located(Mayflower hotel, the facility is not bad.). It's the first day of three day stay in SF.

When I finally arrive to the hotel, it's 30 past 12, it's very very late. After the first nightmare on 4 hours delay, here comes the second.

""""I am sorry your credit card doesn't work.""""
""""WHAT?""""
""""I am sorry, I don't know.""""
""""can you try that again?""""
""""I am sorry, the credit card company charge us very time, so I can't do that.""""
""""...........uh""""
""""if you would like to check-in, you have to pay in advance"""".
(well, it's 12:30, what's your options?)
""""alright, I will pay in cash.""""

Well, as least my wallet can pay for that,so I can checked-in and get my room. But the 3rd situation comes, I only got 10 dollar left in my wallet, I need to stay in SF for another 3 days.

After few international calls to my 2 banks in Taiwan, they said I didn't activated the """"international withdraw function"""" (NOT the international credit card function, so I can still buy stuff using credit card), so I can't withdraw cash in US (it still take with lots fees if you withdraw abroad.) 

Bank transfer?It takes two days or more(and I need a bank account). Western Union? I am not so sure how to make it work,and I need to ask someone go to a bank in Taiwan, that still takes a day.

After a little thinking, """"Hey, there is Bitcoin!"""".

So I talk to a Taiwanese friend(who is in Bitcoin Community) how can I do, and he suggested some ideas.

Because I can still access my Taiwanese bank account online, so I called a friend, tell him give me his bank account details, and I transferred the money to him.

I asked him to buy some Bitcoin in Familymart convenience store and send it to me. It only takes half an hour, YEAH! 

The next step, I need to buy some US fiat money.

The next morning, I try to find some Bitcoin ATM, first stop, the Workshop Cafe, no luck, the staff said it's moved to somewhere else. Second stop, the Nakamoto's in 20 mission. There 's the Bitcoin ATM(it's the one from Workshop Cafe ), but it seem broken,and no people is there at the stand. (Nakamoto's were day off in the time I was at SF.)

An nice guy who is also work in 20 mission tell me maybe I can go to the local hackerspace called """"Noisebridge"""" and give it a shot, when I got there, just a few people with nice smile and willing to hear my story and ask me to try to post on their maillist. After that, there are two nice Bitcoin guy came to Noisebridge and do the exchange with me. And I even met with the founder of Noisebridge - Mitch Altman.

Although people said SF might be the most advanced place on using Bitcoin, but I still take half a day to have some fiat money. And I didn't get a clear information about Bitcoin accepted shops/restaurants in downtown SF, that's a little pity.

But anyway, I had 3 great days in SF, thanks for the help, Satoshi.

The dollar bills look much nicer because it's exchanged by Bitcoin. HAHA

edited: fix typo (I believe there are many mistakes.)"
332,Are they hacked? Anyone know what's going on?
333,"I was just standing in line for my morning coffee at a place in Arnhem, Netherlands where they accept bitcoin and the customer in front of me asked what Bitcoin was when he saw the""""Bitcoin accepted here"""" sticker. The response from the cashier was effectively """"it's magic internet money"""". 

While I had a good laugh and that was a quick way of moving on to the next customer, it occurred to me that I've never heard a (good) explanation that takes less than several minutes. To me this is a pretty critical part of achieving wider adoption - an explanation that gives average Joe on the street a basic understanding and doesn't scare him away. "

Some napkin math says if every satoshi that'll ever exist was picked up and distributed evenly to everyone on earth, each person's share would be about 300,000 satoshis (I may be off by a decimal point in some direction).  If you own even 1 bitcoin, you have over 300x the """"fair share"""".

343,"Bitcoin rewards go from 50 every block for 4 years (approx), 25 for 4 years, etc... This is decreasing supply. And there is a cap at 21 million. Many bitcoins are lost meaning an even lower supply.

So if adoption increases, and we already know supply will go down, isn't this a perfect setup for the price to rise? Isn't this just basic economics? "

345,"I'm trying to understand this behavior. At first I thought it was fail2ban causing a problem but it's not. I installed Vesta Control Panel to manage my server and and have implemented their default firewall rules but have added Bitcoin. 

All outgoing ports are open and incoming is set to drop. With the exception of allowed ports. When I disable all firewall rules the Bitcoin node works fine and gets about 25+ connections. At peak I've seen it around 30 - 40 connections but seems to stick around 25. Thing is when I turn on firewall it starts dropping almost immediately and slowly works it way down to around 10-14 or so connections. If I restart Bitcoin it slowly climbs up to about this amount also and stops. If I disable the firewall immediately it starts climbing again and will within a few minutes be back to around 25 connections. It works fine with fail2ban enabled in this case and disabling fail2ban has no effect on this. The same behavior is exhibited with my Litecoin node as well.

So what gives. Are there any other ports bitcoind might be reliant on or a specif way to establish a rule to make this work?"

347,"I pulled this from an altcoin's blog. It is the best explanation I have seen to explain how bitcoin or any digital currency works. I will be using it from now on when I explain Bitcoin.


How are digital currencies created?

Just like physical currencies, digital currencies (like AppleByte) don’t just pop into existence, they have to be made. In physical currencies, paper bills are printed and coins are minted by government agencies, then distributed into the banking system. In the same way digital currencies must be created and distributed to users.

In a digital currency like AppleByte, the currency is created by a software application. This software runs on each computer connected to the AppleByte network. All of the computers connected to the network work together, sharing the complex calculations necessary to create each AppleByte, and a certain number of AppleBytes are created each day. This process is called mining, and is not free, as it costs computer power and electricity. To compensate computer owners for their work, AppleBytes are paid to the software users connected to the network... 


How are balances kept and transactions processed?

Just like at your bank, your account balance and transactions are stored on a server. At your bank, the bank owns the server. But, as a digital currency, AppleByte’s account data resides on a peer-to-peer (computer-to-computer) network that consists of all the computers logged into the network. This allows for additional security as there is no single server that hackers can attack, and each transaction is verified by all the computers on the network. Just like logging into your bank account with your browser, you can see your AppleByte balance and spend them using the AppleByte Wallet App. The wallet gives you all the info you need, just like using your browser for banking transactions. The Wallet App is available in several versions:  Online, MAC, Windows, Android, and IOS...

355,"Bitwage
I first ran across this company from a new article about someone receiving part of their paycheck in BTC. I was intrigued by this and did a little research. I ran across this little company “Bitwage”.
Bitwage will take all or part of your paycheck – purchase bitcoin – and send that BTC to the wallet of your choice. The sign up was relatively simple. All it consisted of was your email and to create a new password. From there you would fill in your employers information (address, phone number, company name, company website). After you have completed this you would choose to get BTC or fiat If you choose Fiat the money will be loaded onto your Xapo wallet and you could request a debit card that you can use anywhere. If you chose BTC they would convert your fiat to BTC and send it straight out to your wallet.
Bitwage will provide you with a ACH form you bring to your employer and you can designate as much of your paycheck as you would like to go straight to Bitwage and the rest of your check to get sent to the bank of your choice. Sense Bitwage is new they are offering their services commission free for the time being.
My experience went very smooth. I brought the forms to my employer and told them I want %5 sent to this account. The payroll department didn’t have to even know what BTC is in order to implement it. Once the funds are sent to Bitwage via direct deposit they are then exchanged for BTC (they advertise they will give you the best price from when your deposit was made until its sent to your wallet.
Bitwage does take an extra day processing your BTC so for instance if you get payed on a Wednesday you probably wont receive your BTC deposit until Thursday. There support team is very helpful and attentive to concerns of their clients.
If you have anymore questions about this service please leave a comment or PM me.


More reviews on my subreddit /BTC_Reviews"
356,"As far as I can tell, all major world currencies have unique alphanumeric serial numbers printed on their fiat notes. In the scenario above, cash notes could be tokenized on the blockchain and continue to circulate. Consumers would have a choice to operate with crypto wallets, fiat paper notes, or both. Countries would purchase bitcoin to secure satoshis to back their fiat notes and would retain the private keys. Creation and destruction of fiat notes would be visible on the blockchain. The exchangeability would be verifiable as consumers experienced redeeming their notes for BTC or vice versa. Consumers could elect to bypass the backed fiat notes entirely and just operate with BTC on exchanges, if desired. 

Early nations to adopt this """"gold standard"""" would benefit through increased purchasing power as other nations came on board. Fiat notes could be modified to contain public addresses and QR codes to verify their respective value at any time. Benefits would be:

 * transparency of the supply of national currencies 
 * shortening of the learning curve for mass adoption of bitcoin (consumers still hold fiat paper notes) 
 * bitcoin's fixed supply would become the default reserve currency
 * mitigation of counterfeiting

For example, a USD $5 note might be tokenized at a pre-determined amount of satoshis and have a SHA-256 hash of the serial

Sorry for the late reply. We've been busy outside helping with the community. Had a big tremor today around noon that got everyone shook up.

The epicenter was here in my district but we are considered lucky in terms of damagers. We've touched base with the Hospitals here to remind them of our assistance for those unable to cover their own medical costs. Quite a few houses were lost - but again this is nothing in comparison to Kathmandu and the destruction there. We'll be meeting with the local community tomorrow to do needs assessments of homes and schools. It's difficult today due to the ongoing tremors and also all community members are still sleeping in the streets and open spaces are they are afraid to go inside. Phone network comes and goes so widespread communication via the mobile network has been spotty. I'm prepared to help any schools or families who have been affected by this here. Including anything that comes up in neighboring districts that I hear about.

I'll try and call tomorrow. I'll write more tonight if I can. Was unable to sleep last night and have been on the go for the last 36 hours trying to help. 

Really appreciate all your efforts. Of course, if any funds raised cannot be leveraged here I will ensure they are given to a partner org that follows the same mindset as us in Kathmandu. I will have more details of how we can get involved tomorrow.

Pre-built versions are here:  https://github.com/basil00/pairgen/releases

Generating an 80-bit collision took about 1 week on my CPU.  The holy grail is a full 160-bit collision, i.e. finding two private keys that map to exactly the same address.  This is not feasible to find using a single CPU.

The tool was written for fun.  I don't think there are any useful applications of this.

370,"The other day I was making a purchase using my credit card. In a flash it was approved before I was able to fully pull my hand away from the terminal. I got me thinking, my thoughts went like a rabbit trail but eventually it lead to this.

Some services that I have paid automatically every month for years are still charging to my expired cards. I just haven't updated them, and there's been no need to, they're just recurring transactions that the card company is familiar with and they just honor it.

Many people have recurring charges, they just know they have them, put the money in the bank and let automatic bill pay or those services take it.

Automatic bill pay, or recurring charges should be built into some wallets. There can also be a feature where you're wallet is subscribed to receive the amount if it varies by month and you can choose to authorize the transaction or set it to automatic.

There will also be a need to build in the subscription service into the wallet for the business side. It would take both sides to connect and verify to approve the connection.

Hopefully this spurs a thought with someone who can take the idea and make it better."

375,"India is very diverse country. Culturally, politically, religiously, and yes financially! More than 35% of India's people live below poverty line, earning less than $2 a day. Unfortunately, there is not much hope for these people on the horizon, and there isn't much Bitcoin can do for them. I am going to talk about the other two categories who can benefit a lot. These are the middle class, and the filthy rich who have undeclared income/assets.

In India, the middle class which is huge and growing, is extremely limited with their budgets. Usually only one member earns for the whole family. These families are further divided into lower middle class, middle middle class and upper middle class, with an annual income between $10,000 to $100,000. As your income raises, so do your expenses because of your social status. People in India are very concerned about their status, and its not uncommon for people to show off by borrowing out of their means. Especially in northern India, people will take out huge loans to buy expensive cars and huge houses, just so that they are seen as rich. Point being, the middle class is very limited with their budgets and that extra money can help them a lot!

Now comes the other class of the filthy rich. These are usually businessmen who hide their actual income from the authorities in order to evade taxes. This is very very common in India. Just google """"problem of tax evasion in india"""". These people have a lot of money as cash, usually stacked up in bank lockers. They are always on the lookout to park their money somewhere safe. Traditionally, they would buy up real estate in cash, and declare only a fraction of the amount paid as the sale price. But the authorities have recently started cracking hard on this practice. Other alternative was to park the money offshore using """"hawala"""" transactions. But there is a crackdown on these too, due to concerns of terrorism funding.

Most of the people in middle class are salaried people, employed in govt or private companies and their income is almost always 100% white (fully declared and taxes deducted at source). And a lot of the business income is black (undeclared).

How can Bitcoin be useful? People with white money can (not very easily, but legally) transfer their money to international exchanges and buy bitcoins. People with black money can buy those coins off of them with cash, at a premium. Both the groups will benefit. At the end, people with lower income but white money will have a little extra and the people with black money will have a very fungible asset that they can transfer anywhere in the world.

So whats the problem? Unlike China, Bitcoin exposure is VERY limited in India. My guess would be only 1 in 1000 have ever heard about it. So there is a need for better marketing in India. There is also a potential business opportunity of entrepreneurs in India, as most of the people are not that tech savvy to handle all this themselves."

Was googling for a list of Hard Forks and came across this post from March (I must have missed it):

""""Most devs working on Bitcoin Core would (now) say Bitcoin has never undergone a hard fork."""""
379,"Recently I was able to interview one of my favorite musicians and audio engineers, Steve Albini about decentralization as well as Bitcoin for my podcast, [decentralize.fm](http://decentralize.fm). I wrote a [blog](http://tonyswish.tumblr.com/post/118408128705/i-just-interviewed-one-of-my-heroes-for-my-podcast) about Steve's background and why getting the chance to talk to someone so brilliant about Bitcoin was so important to me and I would encourage the community to give it a quick read and a listen.

First and foremost I would like to express gratitude toward those who have shared the podcasts we have done with celebrities and notable people interested or even skeptical about Bitcoin. James Walpole, Eric Martindale and Chaz Ferguson do so much hard work for this show and we believe we have done something completely different from any other podcast around and we really want to encourage the community to spread the word. This isn't about us, it's about really neat projects and the idea of personal empowerment.

The high profile people we have contacted about appearing on decentralize.fm have been strategic and we make it a point to not just book people for attention or who genuinely don't care. 

Steve Albini was different as he was extremely negative on Bitcoin going in. His negativity toward the subject was honest in that he simply does not care about anything to do with Finance, and actively dislikes most people involved in the field. I went out of my way to express to him that I actually agreed and went on to provide articulate answers until to my shock he agreed.

The reason he originally turned it down made sense to me and it's something that a lot of people in Bitcoin communities fail to bring up when it comes to spreading the word about Bitcoin. Before, during and after my time at BitPay, every idea I would notice had to do with spending money on things including Ad Campaigns, sponsorships and a bunch of other wacky ideas that really wouldn't do very much. My belief is that the best way to promote Bitcoin is through honesty and increasing the messaging of it to people who are intelligent and notable. My personal experience led me to believe there is something to this strategy as many of the connections I have made have developed into friendships and people who are genuinely into Bitcoin.

The problem is, so many people in the world absolutely loathe financial types. Since Bitcoin is something covered by the financial media, an immediate assumption is made by many that it is something they just do not care about. They don't see the people upset with the financial system who became huge fans of Bitcoin, they see suits, Wall-Street Types and Libertarians who talk about Liberty and make people care even less. To illustrate how little average people care about Financial media, earlier this year a VERY large and well known financial news cable channel had ratings that were at a 20+ year low with about 177,000 people watching on average. This is a horrendous number and after it was reported, the channel stopped using Nielsen shortly thereafter because of how bad it made them look.

I want to make talking about these topics more fun, not silly or juvenile but something that isn't lame ass old white guys talking about charts to an audience of other old white guys reading charts. Although we are not a Cable news outlet with a budget and a presence on networks that reach 100+ million homes, our podcasts are going to continue to try to reach notable people and talk about new projects that we think are cool or important.

Decentralize.fm's focus always has and always will be focused on technology, but it's important for us to recognize how important technology is to finance in the present. We are going to continue to get interesting guests on the show and I even have a personal """"wish list"""" of guests I am trying to have on. Many of these people aren't easy for a show created by four people who work full time in various Bitcoin/Decentralized tech projects, but so far we have been successful and I don't see why we can't continue.

With that being said, if anyone knows Penn Jillette please contact me :-)

390,"I found bitcoin a couple years ago and have followed it since.  The one thing that always seems to happen (especially in this sub) is that people constantly post videos/articles/ideas that position bitcoin as a new technology that people haven't learned about.   

I think more people know about bitcoin than you think - they just don't need it in their lives.  There is a difference but the effect is the same, no usage (for the common people).  

After years of posting the biggest outlets covering it there is a point where awareness alone isn't how you measure success.  

It might be premature but at what point do we stop getting excited about awareness and start thinking about its intrinsic value?  I guess I just don't see any business implementation as a major deal, it only is if it is used (which I don't think is happening nearly as much). Are we mostly investors in user's clothing?

In my case, I have an account on Youtube that I never sign into and don't plan on ever making a Soundcloud account.

To make things easier, and encourage more tipping, we could create a browser plug-in that connects to a tipping bot. When you are on the page of a song or video that you want to tip, just click a button to tell the bot to make a tip on your behalf and it will use its own account on that particular website to complete the process for you. This could speed up and simplify the tipping process for a lot of people. 

It would also make anonymous tipping possible which would protect your social media information from being linked together by Changetip. You don't have to remain anonymous, but it is an option some people might appreciate. With a little bit of extra programming, multi-sig transactions could make it so that the bot never has direct access to your tipping coins, which is also a concern with Changetip since they hold onto your tipping coin's private key.

Does this sound like an idea that somebody would be interested in using or developing? What does /u/changetip think on this matter?"

* Given the staggering lead and network effect that Bitcoin has, no other distributed alt-coin can ever 'beat' Bitcoin.

Currently I’m writing my thesis on bitcoin. As part of my thesis I want to research how easy/possible it is to make an untraceable (anonymous) transaction between two countries using bitcoin.

Buy bitcoins at an exchange and keep them in a wallet
Move all bitcoins through one or more bitcoin tumblers
Move the bitcoins to an exchange in a different country

First, it didn't come in a envelope like I believe others received it in, mine came in a small white box that was securely taped at every corner. Inside the package the entropy was tightly packed with foam peanuts. One thing I did notice about the entropy package itself was there was no holographic security seal on it and just had clear plastic tape around it keeping it sealed. I guess there could be a few reasons for this such as it being a big issue before with broken seals so they were just removed ahead of time. Or other possibility was on a previous post it was said some of the last batch were faulty so they were individually fixed at which point I'd assume whoever did the repair didn't have those seals and just used tape to repackage it? Would like a definite answer on this from someone over at Mycelium if possible just to ease my nerves."

408,"People are often excited about all the investment going into Bitcoin companies, suggesting that this somehow validates Bitcoin being a brilliant idea.

While, I'm a huge Bitcoin fan, I think this rhetoric is generally misleading.

Typical VC companies invest in dozens and even hundreds of companies. They seek to find obscure businesses that provide a bigger diversification of their portfolio to lower their systemic risks as any smart investor would. 95% of these companies are expected to fail. A few percent of them will make enough money to cover the investment. And if they are lucky and made the right guesses, there will be one or two that are big hits and cover all the losses and generate profit too.

All the Bitcoin investments could simply mean that Bitcoin is a """"weird"""" enough business that VCs feel it provides the much needed diversification.

VCs may invest in Bitcoin companies on the off chance that they underestimate something great, not because they know it's something great. They are not doing as much homework generally as we assume they do. Nor can they predict anything reliably or they would not invest in those 95% of businesses that fail.

In other words, in my opinion the confidence vote of a VC firm isn't much more than the confidence vote of you or me, they just happen to have much more money.

However, regardless of why VCs do it, the funding does make the Bitcoin economy stronger and more useful every day. And, I truly believe that the VCs are making the right bet on Bitcoin, even if not for the right reason."

Dropbox of files: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7dudlieancb1tr0/AAA0xmqujCZsvaQ0f_Uf-03Da?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7dudlieancb1tr0/AAA0xmqujCZsvaQ0f_Uf-03Da?dl=0)

**1. Operating Bitcoin.com facing a new counterparty**
The Ripple FinCen findings related to dealing with Roger Ver set off an internal review related to conducting further business with Mr. Roger Ver. OKCoin’s team came to a decision to discontinue facing Mr. Ver on the management of Bitcoin.com for two core reasons. The first being the findings of the Ripple investigation. The second, on further review, the contract was not in good standing as it did not contain the OKCoin legal entity in the contract. It should also be made aware that OKCoin made every effort to continue management of Bitcoin.com facing a different counterpart under a legally binding contract.

**2. Different Versions of the Contract**
In our review post the Ripple FinCen findings, it was found that v7 (the contract Mr. Ver holds) was not the version of the contract which our finance and accounting department held (v8) digitally and physically. In the past 24 hours, Mr. Ver made public false accusations that CEO Star Xu forged the v8 contract. There was never forgery committed by Star Xu. We would find such forgery to be a serious breach and view the actions of Mr. Ver to assume and claim forgery a seriously misplaced allegation. We will further review every course of action in light of these false accusations by Mr. Ver.  OKCoin holds the original v8 hardcopy contract signed by a former employee at OKCoin and this contract was given to our finance department in December 2014. The document is open to any forensic investigation on the date it was signed. OKCoin also has the digital contract sent to our finance department over QQ on December 16th, 2014 by said former employee. We have provided these screenshots. The former employee and Mr. Ver are friends and formerly worked together at Blockchain.info.

Dropbox Exhibit A

**3. Oath from CEO Star Xu:** 
""""I have attached the digital communications and attachment of the v8 contract that my former colleague sent via QQ to our accountant on December 16th, 2014. The digital and hardcopy of the original signed contract by the former employee are held internally by our finance and operation teams. If I am found to have forged the v8 contract, I face legal ramifications. I welcome Mr. Ver to hire a forensic investigator to examine the authenticity of the hard copy contract. I can promise God on my family’s name that I did not forge the contract. I wonder if Mr. Ver and my former colleague would dare make the same oath of honesty.”

**OKCoin will reward $20,000 USD to anyone with authentication skills confirming that the digital and hardcopy of v8 are genuine and signed from December of 2014 by our former employee.**

Those with information can send findings to corporate@okcoin.com 

**4. Mr. Roger Ver going public:**
Mr. Roger Ver first enacted the threat of use of public opinion as a method of pressuring OKCoin into settling on an agreement. Mr. Ver added a reporter Mr. Jon Southurst of Coindesk into the email communications. OKCoin only released a public notice after being contacted by media for comments. It was relayed to OKCoin that Mr. Roger Ver had contacted them to release openly the private communications. We are regretful that this has become a public matter due to the tactics Mr. Ver used. 

Dropbox Exhibit B

**5. Mr. Roger Ver’s accusations of intent to money launder:**
Mr. Roger Ver falsely accused OKCoin of intending to money launder when it is shown in multiple correspondence that a new contract and new counterpart to receive funds were required for continued management of Bitcoin.com. Mr. Ver has repeatedly shown to be quick to bully and make false allegations in his business dealings. No payment was ever made, attempted, nor intended to a counterparty other than Mr. Ver in the course of OKCoin’s management of Bitcoin.com 

Dropbox Exhibit C


**6. OKCoin’s bitcoin.com contained no ads:**
Everyone is free to view the Bitcoin.com that was created and used by OKCoin here in the Web Archives: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150315024642/http://www.bitcoin.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315024642/http://www.bitcoin.com/)

There are no OKCoin ads on the Bitcoin.com that we managed. OKCoin paid Mr. Ver $10,000 USD per month and developed and operated the website as agreed upon. We also tried to court interested parties to advertise on the website. Mr. Ver continually threatened to use the one month termination notice clause contained in the contract for failing to generate further revenue. These threats occurred while simultaneously asking and expecting OKCoin to continue in good faith to improve Bitcoin.com despite that overhang. Mr. Ver even suggested to redirect Bitcoin.com to OKCoin or OKLink for an exorbitant sum.. 

Mr. Ver sought to close the agreement for the full $550,000 USD dollars remaining followed by an attempt to ask for $200,000 or lower. Mr. Ver did not care for the proper management of Bitcoin.com but was rather solely focused on extracting more money from it. 

We have provided the sources of these communications.

Dropbox Exhibit D

**7. OKCoin is not insolvent:**
To our disappointment, this public slander by Mr. Ver included directly speculating that OKCoin is insolvent, under financial duress and may become the next Mt. Gox. These actions show a lack of respect and proper due diligence. Time will prove that OKCoin’s financial health is strong. We are currently executing on several business projects in the fintech space to improve the lives of consumers and businesses. We generate healthy revenues and have received significant venture capital investments. Our customer service is 24/7 and we welcome any user who has funds on OKCoin to test and withdraw funds.  

It should be noted that Mr. Ver prior to the Mt. Gox event reported to the public that Mt. Gox had no problems as can be seen in this video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4SCAw264qM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4SCAw264qM)

**8. OKCoin’s commitment to innovation:**
We would like to apologize to our customers for this distraction and for wasting your time over such a small matter. OKCoin will continue to release better and better products as a leader in financial technology and we would like to thank again our customers and supporters of our company. "
415,"Personally I only see cons.

Increasing the block size will put extra costs on the users. These costs include: 20x the required bandwidth, 20x more disk space needed relative to time, 20x the required processing power to verify the blocks.

1- Bandwidth required: 34.1 KB/second of the available bandwidth. This may be too much for some people with slow internet connections to run a node, especially people in third world countries. These people will be forced to use trusted and centralized online wallets, or more probably go to the more trusted / less hackable / less volatile and less centralized banks.

2- Disk space: 2880 MB/day, 84.4 GB/month. If you have a 2TB hard drive this would be enough to fill it up in 655 days and you will not be able to free space by moving block files to an external HD or flash drive. Every day there will be more people dropping out of the network because of this requirement. More centralization, more reliance on online wallets.

3- Processing power: harder to calculate than the other two, but the effect will be the same, more expensive to run a node, easier to use a trusted third party.


Advantages:
More penny transactions with zero fees getting transmitted from node to node and saved on lots of hard drives forever.


The way I see it, all this does is sacrifice Bitcoin's core advantages as a trustless and decentralized payment network in favor of cheaper / less competitive transactions. Right now it costs 3¢ to include a transaction in the blockchain. This is insanely competitive with other payment methods and still Bitcoin is not as popular.


Does it make sense to add that extra load on the network and make running full nodes that much harder just to keep it at 3¢ or push it even lower? Wouldn't it be better for Bitcoin if competition for block space increased over time? What am I missing?"
416,"While listening to the current debate about increasing the block size I often hear about proposals to add some automated solutions to e.g. let the block size grow over time. Also many people suggested to include other useful stuff in that hard fork so that we don't have to do it again that soon. This all shows the desire to avoid hard forks.

I see it a bit different. I fear a situation where we have lots of big miners having their clusters running and actually not taking part in the discussion and not caring about the current debate. So having a clear situation where almost everyone can agree on (20mb blocks) holds the possiblity to show the miners that a hard fork can be done and at the same time teach miners who don't follow the debate that they should. As long as we get this 20mb hard fork done now this shows that bitcoin can move and adapt and will automatically sort out people who can't. I think it is good to have that from time to time and that's why I think we shouldn't aim for a state in which we will never need a hard fork again.

If miners really don't want a particular change its fine, its their decision and they have every right to make it. But a hard fork shouldn't fail because people are fearing every change or just don't care enough about recent developments. We're all in the same boat and want the best for bitcoin. lets not be sissy's and make it happen"

Straight to the point; my computer has been a victim of the new ransomware Locker v2.83 

More information about it here: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/373wk0/locker_virus_similar_to_cryptolocker/

And a lot of my important files have been encrypted, I need to make a payment of 0.1 BTC in order to decrypt my files. 

I have 28 hours left on the timer, so this is kind of my last resort. Either I pay or I say goodbye to my files until a tool to decrypt them is out; if that even happens. 


I tried making several accounts in order to do it myself, but every website says it isn't available in my country; so I thought I'd ask you guys for help, I will be able to send a paypal payment to whoever is willing to send the payment to the address asked by the ransomware.

Interested I tried a few other things and found 2FA still required to disable 2FA or to withdraw funds; but not to trade. Allowing the a potential attacker to sell the victims funds at any price. Certain conditions apply but still seems like a hole in the main reasons for 2FA. I did some research on a potential bounty program on cex but only came up with a couple posts with people stating that they found potential exploits and reported to cex asking for bounty only to have cex turn around say they already knew about the bug and patch the hole and pay nothing at all or next to nothing considering the potiental of exploit. I talked about it in chat on cex and was informed to submit a ticket and said might be rewarded....I don't mean to sound evil but this seems like a valuable thing and I would like a decent reward for finding considering it works with the right conditions. So for any of you that could answer what do you think something like that is worth? and the best way to make sure payment is agreed on before/received when disclosed?

1. If I buy a small amount of bitcoins, is there a chance someone will steal them?

2. Where should I buy my bitcoins from? I only want to play around with them and see how it works/get some experience to start off. I just got $20 in the mail for my birthday and I want to use that for the coins. Do people take cash for bitcoins? If so were, and would they do it even though its such a small amount?

3. Is bitcoin's price something that changes a lot? like if I was to get $20 today is it possible it would only be worth $10 towmorrow?

4. Are wallets insured like banks? If someone steals my coins will the wallet company take the heat or will i?

Thanks guys, I'm very new to all of this but it seems fascinating. Any advice would really help me out.

429,"Or, is there a minimum fee for the fee to be acknowledged?

Are transactions included in order by fee size? So would a 0.00001 BTC fee be prioritized over a 0.000001 BTC fee? And a 0.00000001 BTC fee be prioritized over no fee? 

Would it be accurate to view fees as an effective bidding war on whose transaction is included in the next block the soonest?"

432,A crucial event like the coming hard fork would benefit from giving a nod to Satoshi. 20 MB would be heresy.
433,"I don't think the miners have that much of a choice in case we hardfork to 20MB blocks (or anything above 1MB).


**Why?**

The reason is; will the exchange and other liquidity providers (local traders, etc) switch or not? Once the chain forks the coins that are being send and traded can only be one of the two.

&gt;""""But the miners will keep mining the other chain!""""

They'd be mining 25BTC coinbase reward they cannot send to the exchange(s) and/or local traders, because they're not """"valid"""". The exchanges is where the money and liquidity is, hence they decide what are or aren't valid bitcoins.

Sure, if 60% stays on the """"old"""" version, and 40% goes to 20MB-Fork, the network slows down a lot. And the smaller fork can be attacked more easy, but once 51% is on the new fork **and** the exchanges are over, it's going to be very hard to do anything about it. 

**My opinion:**

**It all comes down to one single simple question to the traders on the markets (the exchanges): Will you switch to the new version or not.**

Now I'm not a pro/con on the 20MB blocksize discussion myself because I think both parties have valid opinions why or why not to do it.

But my opinion remains: the open markets have way more to say than a miner.

------------------------------------

Edit: **Bonus round:** Let's say there are 3 exchanges, and 2 switch to 20MB-Coin. The moment they do, I can send my bitcoins (that now exist) to the 3rd one, and sell them for """"real"""" USD. So can everyone. **There will be massive selling pressure on the coin the market thinks is """"fake"""" because the market will decide which one is the Altcoin or not**

Edit: I think its actually impossible to fork Bitcoin. It's a paradox to do so.

Let's hope Lightning matures fast enough"

I have no interest in investing in a currency that can only scale to be used by 1/5000th of 1% of the global population. I thought this was a """"World Wide Ledger"""".

In my opinion the lightning network is a brilliant idea but i think we should see it as an additional way of using bitcoin not THE new way.

445,"Probably one of the core reasons 90%+ of people do not own physical gold in their homes in any material sense. 

People do not want to risk losing their money. The idea of losing an unrecoverable password is not something society is going to accept and adopt. No. Fucking. Way.

We need to move away from this """"decentralized banking or bust"""" idiocy IF the idea is that the manstream should adopt bitcoin. Bitcoin banks are the saviors and not the enemy, if they are independent from each other.  People will never buy into bitcoin unless the risk of losing them is spread out through banking insurance. 

My hunch is that this community is full of meticulous, possibly anal retentive, OCD, super organizers, but guess what?  A lot of us are disorganized, short on attention, forgetful, and aloof.  We need someone to secure our bitcoins for us because we are distracted and don't have the time or resources to recite our """"unique bitcoin passphrases"""" every morning to ensure we don't forget them. Nor do we have 10 acres of land where we can bury our steel plate wallets. Fucking daffy.

Bitcoin banks: how can we make them better and how can they be trusted.  If BofA or Chase offered bitcoin for sale, oh me oh my, talk about the moon. It's either they get on board now, or we wait another 30-40 years for another brand to establish monetary trust.

446,"It would be great to see payment channels implemented in most Bitcoin wallets as the default way for mainstream consumers to send payments to anyone.  https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-micropayments shows how to implement payment channels when both sides of the transaction are online.  We'd also need to cover sending to someone who is offline, and potentially address privacy concerns for the recipient.  Payment channels could help offer some level of consumer protection for payments, in addition to vastly increasing Bitcoin's potential transactions per second.

I've been talking with the owner 2 days ago, while waiting for my papers to print and casually asked him what he thinks of bitcoin. He told me that he has heard about it, but never really looked after it.

I told him that maybe he could give it a try and accept bitcoin as payment in the store. He was very hestitant, but told me if i can provide him enough proof that bitcoin can be profitable and give him a good promotion idea, he could maybe adapt it.

So i'm here, asking you nice people: What promotion could work best in this case? It's a small store in a relatively small city where there is no other store that focuses on IT, so it has a market. 

I thought about printing QR codes with some small amounts like 0.20$ - 0.50$ each and letting him give them out with each purchase above a specific limit, but i'm low on bits to do this, so that's out.

But i believe bitcoin innovation has the potential to offer services no online auto trader has covered. I also think as a sale mechanism, or buying cars,  a strong marketing mix encouraging car shoppers and sellers to try with bitcoin would be a good realistic situation and on ramp in to bitcoin.     
   
Escrow - currently with auto traders, escrow seems to be offered, but as a third party service with costly fees. I think this is a great space for an on site escrow... this could be a complicated process but well worth it - a few years ago my friend brought a car with the wish to bring it to canada.  I do not know all the details, but all said and done,  at some point in the process, the car was completly manufactured with stolen parts, and he was out 13,000.         

     
P2P lending - auto loans exist and they can be quite pricey.  What would be better then a partner in btc jam or  bitcoin lending, or another platform for near instant auto loans that the user has control over.

Around 20 people who didn't knew a lot about Bitcoin joined this thread &amp; asked a lots of questions.

When it comes to discussing Bitcoin with politically active people - it is mostly very educated &amp; interesting young people, and they know a lots of things about Bitcoin, but the most difficulty in understanding they get, when it comes to Bitcoin's units - they have problems of understanding why Bitcoin will rise in value in future, and what happens if we will be out of Bitcoins.

As a coincidence yesterday I've met around 10 activist-people on the street of our little Russian town, who were promoting some communist paper magazine :P These guys were really promoting communism &amp; I started talking about Bitcoin to them, and we had an hour-long amazing discussion. Interesting coincidence - and the political guys I met on the street is almost the same like those political people with whom I had a discussion in /r/Ukraina - seems like yesterday's street meeting prepared me for a discussion today on /r/Ukraina :)

I was trading BTC for cash deposits back in May and one particular trade for a decent amount of money (more than $1k) was reversed today. 

After looking back at the receipt the buyer uploaded to me in comparison with other buyers' receipts, this particular scammer's receipt was different. It did not show """"Cash Received"""" as it did on the other ones (something i should have caught on my own and disputed the trade right then and there).

I have called my Credit Union and told them the situation. I had told them i was almost positive it was a cash deposit and they told me they would call me back after looking in to it. But after doing some digging on my own, I'm now positive it was a check deposit and somehow got it reversed.

I'm trying to build a colored coin wallet using NBitcoin and any block explorer. The thing is that I can use any block explorer for almost every functionality of the wallet besides asking for my balance in colored coins. What are the ways to get the balance of an address in colored coins if not using CoinPrism API?? If I'm not wrong every other block explorer like BlockTrail, Blockchan.info or Blockr do not let me to do that.

Another question is related to the structure and components of a web or hybrid wallet. I recognized the following main components:
* Library for Key Management and Signing (NBitcoin, BitcoinJS, BitcoinJ)
* Block explorer to interact with the network and publish transactions

Is that correct? What other components shouls I take into account for the development of a colored coin wallet?

Edit: Context - This person runs a bitcoin ATM or uses local bitcoins or something to sell bitcoins to people. This isn't about using exchanges or Coinbase to sell bitcoin.

&gt;Hey everyone, im here to give everyone some kind of bad news.

&gt;Recently Pierce and I spoke to Agent Angel Fitzsimmons from the IRS. We had an audit with them regarding our Bitcoin operations. The IRS now has a new section specifically devoted to checking up on people selling Bitcoin, and Bitcoin related businesses. I just want to pass along the information she gave to us.

&gt;Basically the bottom line is that if you sell Bitcoin, you are a money transmitter, and are required by law to register as an MSB with FinCEN, regardless of how much you may sell. Michael, and I had spoken before this, and he had informed me that a lawyer had said that as long as it is less than $1000 per person per day they would not qualify as an MSB. However, according to Agent Fitzsimmons this only applies to check cashers and sellers of prepaid access, which Bitcoin is neither.

&gt;If you know that you are supposed to register as an MSB and hold and AML/KYC policy, but have not done it, or refuse to do it, fines are $25,000 per day that you were supposed to hold the policy.

&gt;If you have questions about anything, we will do our best to answer them. Our meeting with her lasted for almost 5 hours, we had to provide her with a complete list of sales, bank statements, bitcoin statements, a flow chart of how we work, and we now have 30 days to comply or be charged.

They then sent this bitcoin through several tumblers, and kept it in a wallet somewhere on the internet. 

Then they called their bank, and disputed the charges when they actually went through and declined. They cited fraud or hackers or something.

They've agreed to do so (although it is yet to happen) and they recognise the value of doing this for all of their international customers. For me this allows me to monitor an address knowing that it contains enough cash for the supplier to continue operating for 2-3 months. If I see the balance in the wallet dwindle I can ask the right questions and potentially order from an alternate supplier.

Until I needed my supplier to prove cash reserves I'd never thought of this as such a valuable use of bitcoin.

TLDR; Greek supplier agreed to stick eu50,000 into a bitcoin wallet to prove liquidity."

BIP 101 seems to have been completely ignored. After months of debate, it is highly unfortunate that one side seems to be unwilling at all to in any way compromise. While the businesses, the users, and the miners quickly decided that the proposal makes sense, albeit after some negotiation to reduce the initial size to 8mb from 20mb, a tiny, albeit very loud minority, have completely failed to engage in the discussion and come to a reasonable compromise.

We are being held for ransom with a gun to our head and for what """"real"""" reason I do not know. Their opposition is not based on any technicality, as shown by their failure to provide any analysis of what size is reasonable, or their failure to take into account the fact that altcoins have shown such increase to be utterly safe, but on some incomprehensible and paranoid ideology which further dependents on wishful thinking such as lightning.

Lightning is unsafe. The hubs can be flooded and all coins stolen, leading to a centralised point of failure at a magnitude of 1000 times mt gox. It is utterly untested, useless for a number of years in any event and plays with the fundamental underlying incentives of the bitcoin network. How such option can be offered as an alternative, when considering the above, I can not understand. If increasing the blocksize is rash, depending on a completely untested system which plays with foundamental incentives in a consensus critical system is highly irrational.

519,"Facts:

1: The stress test has shown that transaction fees for individual transactions on the chain will increase the more transactions increase.

2:  Individual payments through many wallets have no way of increasing the processing fee.

3.  Even by upping the processing fee, one has no way of knowing if the submitted fee is enough ... in realtime.  Thus, increasing the fee is a stab in the dark and a crossing of fingers.

4.  The more transactions there are, the less each users """"toll"""" is per transaction.

5.  The higher the blocksize, the more transactions can be processed and the more expensive a spam attack is per minute.

6.  **Most Importantly** any **off-chain** or **side-chain** solutions will be run by corporations and subject to the laws of the land ... these solutions make Bitcoin mutable and 100% destroy fungibility for all off-chain transactions (for example Coinbase).  In effect, these solutions kill many of the use cases for bitcoin depending on what country one lives in.  Do you really want coinbase dictating currency exchange rates and blacklisting addresses (or any other company).  **Small blocksize limits lead DIRECTLY to centralized bitcoin services off chain** because the price of utilizing the blockchain independently  would be financially exclusive to the common user or unbanked (gee, who would want that?).  If bitcoin plays by banking rules, because off chain companies are subject to the laws of the land, why would one use bitcoin at all?  What advantages over traditional banking would it have (especially if banks start clearing between each other using privatized ledgers/chains)?

**none**

Gavin is correct.  This place can become an echo chamber, and many people have vested interests in a small blockisize, so they can make a profitable start-up at the expense of an immutable ledger for the citizens of the world.

534,"Bitcoin transaction fees shoudl be expressed in BTC per output, not BTC per kB.

Currently the standard transaction fees, fee thresholds and transaction priorities are expressed and coputed in terms of BTC per kilobyte (kB) of the transaction.  For example, the standard fee in the wiki is said to be 0.0001 BTC per kB.

This fee philosophy may seem natural to computer programmers, but it is bad business practice.  Prices of services with broad and mostly casual clientele, like payment processors, should be expressed and computed in ways that the generic customer can easily understand, as flat fees or simple formulas involving prameters that he understands.  A generic """"customer"""" of the bitcoin system cannot be expected to know the byte size of his transactions, not even within an order of magnitude. 

It is not enough for the wallet software to compute the fee when sending each transaction.  The customer must be able to compute it reliably in advance, e.g. when making a budget or setting prices for a business that uses the blockchain internally.

The price charged to the customer must also be proportional to the value of the service rendered, *as perceived by the client*; and not to the actual cost to the service provider of serving that particular customer.  A patron at a restaurant expects to pay the same price as anyone else for the same dish; he does not want to know that his steak cost more than his neighbor's steak because the gas stove broke down and the cook had to use an electric one.  (Of course, the *total* revenue must be greater than the *total* cost, averaged over a suitable time frame; but it is the managers's job to figure out the right prices to ensure that condition.)  

In particular, the price must depend only on parameters that are under control of the client.  In a restaurant a la carte, the price should be specified for the whole dish, that the client can choose to order or not; rather than per gram of weight, that the customer cannot choose.  

Following these principles, IMHO the fee for a vanilla bitcoin transaction (minimum, threshold, whatever) should be specified as a flat BTC amount per output, rather than per kB.  

Surcharges may be applied for special transactions, e.g. an extra flat fee for each additional signature in a multisig input, or for outputs that are substantialy larger than the typical simple one.  But always observing the principles above: by formulas that the client can easily understand, that are proportional to the service tha he gets, and only for things that he has control of.

It is not necessary to charge also for ordinary inputs.  Since each transaction output can be spent only once, it will not be possible to overload the system for free by abusing of many-input, single-output output transactions.  That is, the fee that a transaction pays for each output can be viewed as paying also for its subsequent use as input.

In fact, charging for inputs would contradict the third principle above, because a client usually has no control on them: if his coins are split over many UTXOs with the same address, he is forced to list them all by Satoshi's decision, not by his own.  In contrast, it is him who chooses the number of outputs.  

It would be desirable also to exclude any return change output from the fee formulas, since the need for such outputs is a design choice, not the user's choice.  That could perhaps be defined as any (or just one) simple output that sends to one of the input addresses an amount that is smaller than the total input amount from that address.

In summary, the minimum fee of a transaction should be a flat amount of BTC per output, ignoring inputs and perhaps return-change outputs, with simple surcharges for more complicated inputs or outputs.  Say, 0.2 mBTC (~6 US cents now) per output.

IMHO the fee should also be *the* fee, not just a minimum fee; and it should be fixed in the 'consensus rules' so that clients cannot change it and miners have no control over it.  It would simplify the system enormously and make it much more robust and simple to use. But that is another can of worms...  "

545,"If you have an interest in the block size debate and haven't read Jeff Garzik's [BIP-100](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf) yet, you should. Besides having what I consider the best proposal so far, the introductory pages provide a thorough background on the block size issue (in plain English).

The summary of his proposal (from the text):
    
    1. Hard fork, to 
    2. Remove static 1MB block size limit. 
    3. *Simultaneously*, add a new floating block size limit, set to 1MB.
    4. The historical 32MB limit remains. 
    5. Schedule the hard fork on testnet for September 1, 2015. 
    6. Schedule the hard fork on bitcoin main chain for January 11, 2016. 
    7. Changing the 1MB limit is accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34, a one­way lock­in upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold by 90% of the blocks.
    8. Limit increase or decrease may not exceed 2x in any one step. 
    9. Miners vote by encoding ‘BV’+BlockSizeRequestValue into coinbase scriptSig, e.g. “/BV8000000/” to vote for 8M. Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top 20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen.

The benefits should be obvious (also from the text):
    
    G1: Demonstrates change is possible; the bitcoin protocol can be upgraded.
    G2: Eliminate 1MB limit as impediment to adoption.
    G3: Get hard fork risk out of the way early.
    G4: KISS solution, in terms of code changes. 
    G5: Upgrade path, yet constrained until problem &amp; solution better understood.

G3 is really important because it separates the hard fork from any potential block size change by at least 3 months, thereby greatly reducing any chance of split chains forming.

The main objection in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/39kzyt/draft_bip_100_soft_fork_block_size_increase/) and [a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/39xn3v/bip_100_draft_v081_changes_32mb_explicit_cap/) was that the voting was done by miners. As Jeff notes in the proposal, voting by miners is the """"lesser of the evils"""" because there is no way currently to reliably poll full nodes or other stakeholders for their votes. Also as noted by Jeff in [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/39qh66/i_would_like_more_discussion_about_this_objection/cs5u3r1), full nodes do vote for adopting this system, and need to vote again in the future to raise the block size above 32MB.

More importantly though, most objections seems to equate the concept of miners that vote with the current generation of miners, i.e. mining farms and pools that operate to generate a profit from mining. The concern is that these miners will vote for block sizes that benefit their economic interests, for example keeping the block size small to reduce orphans. What this analysis misses is that fact that once the block size is determined by miners' votes, there will suddenly be an economic incentive for many stakeholders who are not currently mining, to start mining. Payment processors, exchanges, smart contracts providers, vault services, wallet makers, early adopters and others will all be motivated to participate in mining in order to influence the block size.

Aside from actually mining themselves, it would seem natural for a market for votes to form. Rather than mining themselves, interested parties would pay miners to vote for their preferred block size. I could imagine this becoming a standardized bounty system, whereby interested parties post bounties for votes and miners would decide what to vote for based on the bounties offered. Although a trusted marketplace would likely suffice, there may even by a way to cryptographically guarantee that the bounty payments will be paid to the miner in exchange for their vote.

And just like p2pool was created to push back against the trend of centralized mining, it would be natural for it to be extended to allow for pool users to vote for their preferred block size as well.

So in summary, I believe that """"voting by miners"""" should be seen as """"voting by everyone"""" and should not serve as an objection to BIP-100 adoption."

548,"**In London**

It is Monday morning. I am having Monday blues. After dressing up, I get ready to go to work. Along the way to the train station, I drop by a café for breakfast. Compared to a year ago, the listed prices have all been changed using ฿ or bitcoin as the denomination. Fascinating! I ordered my usual breakfast set – bread, egg and coffee. Payment was made using contactless Bitcoin card bought recently from the bank. It reminds me of how I made payment with my previous rewards card. 

After breakfast, I continue my walk to the train station. At the gantry, I tap the payment device using the card used earlier at the coffee shop. Not too long ago, the train company just credited ฿ into my card based on the value of the previous Metro card. It was a massive exercise involving the train company, the banks and the BAUK (Bitcoin Authority of the United Kingdom). As seen from the number of media reports during the past year, the BAUK had been very busy ever since the government accepted IMF’s recommendation adopting bitcoin as the unifying currency for all countries globally. 

After work, I decide to do some shopping. After choosing my items, I take out my card for payment. The process is a little different from credit cards. I do not need to give my card to the cashier. Instead, I just need to wave my card at the payment device, and payment amount is automatically deducted (transferred from my address to the merchant’s address). It is quite similar to the VISA wave card used a couple of years ago. The sore point is that there is no longer credit card discount but I am sure merchants will reward shoppers in other ways! A minute later, I received a SMS from my bank saying that I had made a payment for my shopping. Good! At least I know when unauthorised people are spending my card if they do steal it.

Ah! Finally home! I have only a balance of 9 dollars plus left in my card as printed in the receipt. Time to top up the card! The BAUK had cautioned against maintaining a large balance in the card, since losing it will mean losing the money. Hence, I top up only $50 every time, unless there is a need to purchase large ticket items. Besides, topping up is easy. The bulk of my bitcoins is kept with Barclays. As per the Internet Banking procedure, after I have login to Barclays, I need to specify the amount (denominated in ฿) to be transferred to the card. The protection mechanism remains unchanged, namely my userID, password and token. 



**In San Francisco**

Some time back, Mary and I had purchased a tour package to San Francisco. At the London airport, we notice money changers are no longer there. All the shops have changed their price listing to ฿ denominated. At the San Francisco airport, it is the same situation. This makes it easier to compare the price of similar items. 

On the streets of San Francisco, It is the same shopping payment experience as how I had paid in London. Not only can I save on currency conversion cost, I no longer need to convert the price mentally in my head! Should I run out of bitcoins in my card, all I need to do is to get onto the Internet and instruct my bank through Internet Banking to top up the amount I desire. Also, I no longer need to worry about credit card fraud because the maximum amount that can be stolen is the amount I have in my card.




**The Transition Period**

Bitcoin has come a long way. When it first started, it was associated with criminal activities like drugs, terrorism and money laundering. Gradually however, people come to realise that Bitcoin is only a technology. Criminal activities are driven by ill intent and cash is the mechanism to enable the activities. Cash is here to stay, criminal activities or not. Bitcoin works because it unifies all the countries’ currency, provides a medium of exchange, serves as a unit of accounting, and provides a mean to store wealth, all ELECTRONICALLY. Though previous digital currencies existed, Bitcoin is the only one to achieve global acceptance because it solves the problem of double spending, the main common problem in digital currency.


**Exchanges**

While bitcoin has now replaced most of the world’s currencies completely, bitcoin and country-issued currencies co-existed for a substantial period of time. When Bitcoin just started, exchanges appeared to interchange between bitcoins and country-issued currencies. Like businesses in general, some exchanges failed while others strive. Influencing factors include system security, integrity of system owner, competency of system owner and relationship between exchange and regulator. These exchanges started as online websites. 


**Bitcoin ATM**

A few years after the first exchange was established, bitcoin Automated teller machine (ATMs) appeared and became popular. ATMs initially served to increase Bitcoin awareness and popularise Bitcoin among the masses. They gradually evolved to become the easiest way to buy and sell bitcoin, previously a role played by the online exchanges. Fueled by this convenience, the number of ATMs increase exponentially while the number of online exchanges increase relatively moderately.


**Payment Processing Companies**

Apart from the masses, much effort had been catered specifically for merchants as well. Payment processing companies effectively served as dedicated moneychangers for merchants, enabling easy conversion between bitcoin and fiat. Merchants welcome Bitcoin because it gives them access to a new segment of customers – the bitcoiners. Some bitcoiners especially the early adopters are rich individuals. Relative to the fees charged by credit card companies, the transaction fees charged by bitcoin payment processing companies are much lower by as much as 70%. This translates to immediate cost savings for merchants. 


**Bitcoin Shops**

Fully ฿ denominated shops first appeared online, selling mostly IT-related and everyday products. This persisted for a while before a few of them are acquired by long-established names like Amazon when it is clear that the establishment begins to accept Bitcoin as part of the financial system. Eventually, the first brick-and-mortar Bitcoin shop appeared on the main street, accepting only Bitcoin as payment. 


**Bitcoin Card**

Various payment cards already existed, including ATM cards, cash cards, credit cards and debit cards. It is therefore easier for consumers to adapt when bitcoins exist in the form of a card. Prior to bitcoin cards, payments at brick and mortar stores were mostly made using smartphones through the bitcoin wallets. Consumers need to enter password, navigate several screens, key in data multiple times and scan merchant’s QR code before making successful payments. This was a cumbersome process preventing large scale adoption by merchants and consumers. With the bitcoin card, all the consumers need to do is to tap it against the bitcoin terminal. Payment is confirmed when the green light is flashed. The card can be recharged by transferring BTC to its address. During the initial stage, bitcoin terminals are loaned to the merchants free-of-charge so as to encourage bitcoin adoption. Later on, the credit card charging model for merchants were referenced and merchants were charged a fee for leasing the terminals. "

552,"There are about 3 proposals so far (I'll keep it short):

- BIP 100 lets the miners vote the size up/down anytime with repeatable votes (32mb limit)
- BIP 101 is a timed increase (after the initial miner vote)
- BIP 102 is a once-off small increase (after the initial miner vote)

What if we implemented all 3 proposals at once? Here is how I imagine it, since some slight changes are needed to make sense of it all...

BIP 102 is basically the same as BIP 101. BIP 101 could change to being the alternative of the 32mb limit of BIP 100, starting with 8mb - a 'maxmax block size' if you will. Then BIP 100 will control the max block size votes, which all *3 of these proposals have to do anyway*. BIP 100 and 102 are immediately compatible (using the 1st repeatable vote to trigger BIP 102).

To make it compatible with BIP 102's KISS and observe approach, implement a death flag that accepts a signed message from a particular key to stop BIP 100 and 101 from continuing if shit hits the fan after the first or second increase, or up to a particular size (so we go back to the drawing board with a new hard fork solution). If the death flag is unused after 1 or 2 votes (or up to a particular size) then this mechanism becomes permanent, and the death flag validation code can be removed safely. If the dev with the key goes rogue or got his key compromised when the solution is clearly working, we just need to do another hard fork (to remove the death flag validation code). For better security, make it a multi sig key, but it's not necessary since it is easy to collude and even if not, it doesn't solve anything in a timely manner.

One part I disagree with BIP 100 is the down size vote: IMO it needs to make the vote only go up, never down. This lets a fee market work without being forced on the users by a down vote. When there is clearly a block size clog, the vote up is incentivised because more volume = more fee profit, especially when the cbase is smaller. But there isn't a point to vote down: if you want to protect from a bandwidth bottleneck attack, but you voted for it to go up 3 months ago, you already agreed to support that much bandwidth/cpu cycles by voting the higher block size.

Is this another dumb idea of mine :)? Is the death flag too dangerous? If Reddit thinks it is OK I'll resubmit it to the mailing list."

I use both BTC and MoneyGram so I am not seen as suspicious at my local CVS, sending money every 2 weeks to foreign countries raises a flag in my opinion.

Here is my issue. I sent money to a vendor in Turkey 4 weeks ago, was given a receipt and everything cleared, the man got his $600 and I got my package a couple days later. 2 weeks later the same vendor had a sale and instead of sending BTC I went the MoneyGram route (needed it asap) again. This time the MoneyGram spokeswoman had the information identical as last time and was able to just submit a new transfer request. I paid the cashier and the MoneyGram receipt was printed. I went to check the status of the transfer last night and the reference number does not exist? What is going on with my money? I know it has not been claimed and the number is correct, I have checked the receipt and even tried entering the receivers name to see if the woman accidently switched it.

Have I been listed as suspicious and my money is being held in limbo? Did MoneyGram lose my $315? Do I go to CVS directly about this. This is the first time I have encountered this issue and I have sent over 10 BTC and 10 MoneyGram transfers over the past few months.

At least Armstrong has stopped ridiculing anyone mentioning Bitcoin, but what follows remains incredibly absurd.

&gt;I am skeptical about private cryptocurrencies because anything that threatens those in power losing control or avoiding taxes will be hunted down with a vengeance.

Cryptocurrencies sure are being hunted down when former treasurers and banking executives have jumped ship to joink the ranks of Bitcoin proponents.

Bitcoin is also a politician's wet dream in terms of tracking, identity verification and control. Governments are virtually guaranteed to adopt some form of cryptocurrency.

&gt;The big problem government has with moving fully electronic is that not everyone has a computer and about 50% of the world does not even have a bank account.

Just about anyone in finance today understands that mobiles are entirely capable of handling Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency with a mobile app for that matter. When was the last time anyone lugged around a 5kg brick simple to do online banking? Has Armstrong heard of M-Pesa?

The part about half of the world not having a bank account is laughable. If Armstrong spent a few minutes reading or even testing a wallet out, he'd grasp the notion that you become your own bank. For someone with a strong programming background who claims to have created a true artificial intelligence, he seems to be completely lost on everything that's happened here in the past several years.

It's undeniable that Armstrong's predictive model is effective and powerful. At the same time, he dismisses fundamentals in favor of cycles. So why is he dismissing Bitcoin using arguments based on fundamentals?

I am not against the increase, just making sure people are aware and careful about it:
It is relatively cheap to create many many transactions with zero fee, or with close-to-zero fee. even if it costs 50,000$ per attack burst, it is still nothing compares to government or bank money.

If you include these spam transaction into the blockchain and increase the blockchain accordingly, the blockchain will reach several Terabytes (TB) in size, and this is not reversible. This will hurt the simple man to run bitcoin cheaply, and will help the centralization of bitcoin (very bad).

Bitcoin should deny such attack on the network and deny tiny transactions and never include them in the blockchain, than allowing those transaction into the blockchain.

592,"Consider that first complete snapshot of what the community agreed """"Bitcoin"""" should be was defined not by feats of hashpower strength, not by Reddit karma or the invisible crisscrossing gravitational fields of well connected HODLers, but simply by a particular set of human (or committee of humans') opinions and theories summarized in a human-written, human-readable whitepaper. 

You did not need to know how to code to join or reject the consensus of the whitepaper; anyone can understand what it proposes* given a careful read.

The appeal of these theories drew in other humans, who contributed the original """"proof of work"""":  donating their time and resources (to the exclusion of other commitments) to help support that consensus by developing and testing the first client.  Consensus had far fewer variables and influences tugging on it. 

On a related note: What would the Bitcoin whitepaper look like today if it were written from scratch? How would the influence of the current dominant hashpower and wallet interests (factors which did not yet exist when the original paper was written) on consensus-forming be addressed in such a paper?

597,"I've been revisiting BitCoin recently, and thought of an application where businesses could accept BitCoin payments from customers, whom would pay through an intermediary, where the Bit would be transferred to USD (assuming it is a US merchant).   This would be huge for companies that want to accept Bit payments, but that don't actually want to deal with the BitCoin.  
  
In researching, I realized that this already exists, and likely has existed for years.  So I'm late to the party, but it's the thought that counts.  In having the theory, prior to researching, I put a bit of thought into how this intermediary would make money, and came up with a couple ways, all of which involved a transaction fee, exchange fee, etc.
  
When researching about these (already existing) Payment Platforms or Payment Processors, (e.g. BitPay, CoinBase, CoinGo, etc.), I realized that they advertised things like """"no transaction fees"""".   
  
I'm curious, from an operations and finance perspective, how would a payment processor of this time, dealing with BitCoin to USD exchanges be making money?  Who is getting charged, the customer or merchant?  If someone savvy wants to take a crack at this thread, I'd go one step further and ask, what are the risks associated to the Payment Processor in terms of volatility risk?  Are they holding BitCoin? What might their balance sheet look like?  And anything else one might want to add to this discussion.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  

*Edited on 8/11*.  (fixed auto-correct typos from ipad).  Since writing this post I have come up with, what I believe, to be the most practical way to make money as a payment processor.  The user doesn't pay a fee, much like in CC payments, although the merchant does pay a small fee.  The problem with that would be, that why accept BitCoin, if they're already getting """"gouged"""" from the CC companies on Merchant Service fees?  I came with the following: a)possibly the fees aren't as big as CC fees, b) more importantly, there is *no* risk of chargebacks!, c) it encourages a certain demographic or individual with particular ideologies (the first BitCoin movers) to purchase services/products from this BitCoin-accepting vendor.  Not sure if that's the best operating model?"

Do you know when the United State stopped backing currency with Gold? 1971

Do you know how much money was created out of thin air since 1971 because it became unnecessary to back it with Gold? About 2/3 of all debt since US Constitution.

Do you still believe a dollar is a dollar is a dollar?  A Dollar's value is $.03 compared to a dollar the year we instituted the Federal Reserve ( 1913 ).

Do you know that when a bank makes a loan that it creates out of thin air over 90% of the currency loaned out by a ledger entry and this is primarily how new money is created (Fractional Reserve Banking) and old money then dilutes becoming worth less (Inflation)?  The Bank makes interest profit on money it never had.  Yes, and incomes have not grown to meet the inflation.  Wonder were the middle class went now?

Do you know that Bank of America has 1.7 Trillion dollars in assets as of 2014 and 54 Trillion dollars in liabilities?  All large banks are bankrupt.

Do you know that for every Dollar in existence that approximately $.97 of it is debt owed by someone else (monetary debt system)?

Do you know what a Bank Bail in is?  It has happened in other countries recently recently (Government taking money from your bank account to pay expenses).

Do you know that the U.S. Dollar is 62% of the World's reserve currency and it faces serious competition this year?  This means other countries use the U.S. Dollar as a payment system to settle debts between themselves.  It also means when we create money to pay our debts we are exporting resultant inflation to other countries and if you are looking you will learn other countries are getting sick and tired of it (assimilating our inflation).

Do you know the difference between Money and Currency?  This one you can look up.

Here is the idea I'm trying to do. 
Have it to where a customer can come to the storefront with no bitcoin or bitcoin wallet, just a debit/credit card. They use the debit/credit card to pay for bitcoins at a premium above the cost of the service/product, and then transfer that bitcoin to the seller/provider of the services. 

From there, the seller would need to transfer the bitcoin into USD currency to receive their payment, they would transfer the bitcoin+ the markup automatically to a merchant and in turn i would sell the bitcoin, keep the markup, and give them the equivalent in USD of what their service would have cost originally. 

I know this sounds weird and complicated, but I thought of it and am trying to figure out just how that would work. I have seen things like coinkite but I'm not sure exactly how that would work. 

I want to act as a merchant processor for the bitcoins so the store only receives the cost of their service, the customer pays a small markup in order to use their debit/credit card, and I would receive a profit from the markup the customers pays (or a processing fee the store pays). 

Please advice me on how this could work and what is needed. How does a customer take a credit card and buy bitcoins easily without needing to go online and set stuff up, like the most instant way to do it?

607,"The problem with the blocksize debate is very human: Different people, all of which have the same best intentions (here: Bitcoin's success), weigh the different risks and dangers of either keeping or increasing the block size limit differently. As a consequence they come to different conclusions and viewpoints. This is first and foremost the result of the operation of different brains, and we shouldn't assume that the """"other"""" side is necessarily less intelligent than oneself, or even evil, just because they come to another conclusion - although this is very difficult, because the OWN viewpoint is always, naturally, the most obvious and plausible one!

*(Note that I am talking only about the people with best intentions, who I assume are the vast majority. Of course there may also be people with conflicting interests on EITHER """"side"""", but I expressively want to keep them (and any emotions related to them) out of the equation here, because anything else would stop a pragmatic discourse before it starts.)*

All these people have in common that they want to keep the current values of Bitcoin, like limited supply, a reliable and decentralised network, quick and low-cost transactions, an ever-increasing adoption rate of Bitcoin to increase Bitcoin's value via the network effect, and to keep Bitcoin the indisputable """"number one"""", ahead of other digital (crypto-)currencies.

Now we are facing the fact that in the presence of historically ever-growing block sizes, we'll sooner or later come to a point where some of these values have to be, to some extend, """"sacrificed"""" (or traded one against another), i.e. we have to decide which value is more important than another, or which value is more threatened if Bitcoin evolves in a certain direction. Just a few examples, without any particular order or claim to be exhaustive:

- If Bitcoin's blocksize remains unchanged *forever*, the growth potential is limited (3 TX/s = 1 Transaction per world inhabitant per 100 years), TX fees will rise significantly (""""payment vs. settlement network""""), and Bitcoin will fail to honour its original promises and design targets.

- If Bitcoin's blocksize increases, the decentralization of miners and/or network nodes is at risk (due to data rates, cycle counts needed for verification, storage), and Bitcoin will fail to honour its original promises and design targets.

- If Bitcoin's blocksize remains unchanged, growth (in adoption and price) is at risk and as a consequence nb of nodes and hash rate will decrease/stop increase, hence decentralization is at risk, and Bitcoin will fail to honour its original promises and design targets.

- If Bitcoin's blocksize increases, Pandora’s box is open for further, more disruptive, protocol changes (e.g. 21 Mill cap limit), the trust into Bitcoin the protocol will be lost, and Bitcoin will fail to honour its original promises and design targets.

Some people have more idealistic views as to what Bitcoin should be technologically, whereas others rather want it to become mainstream to survive (grow or die).

Some feel more the danger that a premature protocol change may destroy something that has worked fine up to now, while others feel the danger that lack of adaptation to changing circumstances (=TX/s) in due time may destroy something that has worked up to now, and once destroyed, will be hard or impossible to rebuild.

Some feel the danger more from the inside of the system (like reduction of decentralization, scalability), others feel the danger more from the outside competition and ecosystem (Ethereum, Ripple, private banks' blockchain solutions...).

Lot's of arguments have been exchanged in the past, but it seems that this couldn't bring us much closer to a (near) unanimous viewpoint. So now, given this stuck situation, the question is: Will we ever be able to escape this catchy situation of different judgements of threats? Will we/the community find a viable compromise?

* (a) If yes, [how shall we | who is going to] decide which way to go?

* (b) If no, what will we hence end-up with?

About (a): Maybe somebody could collect the (current) viewpoints of all the main stakeholders to see how far the positions really are apart (and this overview table should be update-able by the stakeholders as opinions will hopefully change over time, as should be the case amongst any [intelligent individuum](http://i.imgur.com/gg0R5km.png)). Is there a website somewhere showing this? Maybe sides are not as far apart as we think. Maybe the one side is not in favour of keeping 1 MB *forever* under all circumstances, as the other side may sometimes perceive. Maybe the other side won't insist on a 40% yearly blocksize increase but my agree upon a more adaptive strategy taking other criteria like de-facto bandwidth increase into account.

About (b): If no consensus can be reached, the question is how to proceed. It seems that currently the opposing camps have already conceded that a consensus is not achievable, and both sides are now following rather """"hard-liner"""" strategies:

- The advocates of no (or low) blocksize increase say that no increase shall happen unless all core-devs and other main stake holders say """"yes"""". In effect, this equates to a veto right to any key stakeholder against a blocksize increase. Mathematically speaking, we have a minimum-function: If *BSI(i)* is the Block Size Increase tolerated by stakeholder *i*, then the actual blocksize increase will turn out to be *min_i(BSI(i))*. The argument for this conservative consensus policy is that Bitcoin should generally be protected from arbitrary or pre-mature dangerous and not well thought-through changes triggered by minorities and advertised to the popular masses. So, in case of doubt or disagreement, one could say that *no change* to the protocol is the smallest common denominator to safeguard the protocol against damages.

- The advocates of a more progressive blocksize increase strategy argue that it should not be possible for a minority to hinder Bitcoin from developing in a way that a (large) majority thinks is best, or even necessary, for Bitcoin and its ecosystem. Bitcoin is not owned by a small number of core developers that happen to be in the driver's seat of the SW development project called """"bitcoin core"""". Since Bitcoin is open source, any other group has the same right to open their own SW branch, and it is up to the Bitcoin community as a whole (stakeholders like miners and alike) to decide which developer group or SW version they trust most. Mathematically speaking, it more resembles *mean_i(BSI(i))* than *min_i(BSI(i))*, and it also appears more democratic since voters on one extreme do not have much more weight than voters on the other extreme. Finally, there is the argument that Bitcoin's 1 MB block size limit was never written in stone (unlike the 21 Mill cap limit), and that on the contrary the 1 MB was from the start only considered a temporary limitation. Hence, the strategy of keeping the 1 MB in case of disagreement does not naturally follow the original design concept and promise of Bitcoin. 

At times, both camps consider the strategy/logic of the other camp as somewhat hostile or overbearing:
The """"progressive"""" camp may perceive the """"conservative"""" camp's attitude as arrogant when they demand that a small elite group should have the sole right for deciding upon Bitcoin's technological future. On the other hand, the """"conservative"""" camp perceives it as a hostile act to challenge the up to now undisputed core-dev group by a popular (miners [75%]) vote, knowing that, if it really happens and majority is against them, they will hardly be able to do anything against the """"invincible hashing-power weapons"""" of the miners. This could make an example for future forks completely triggered by big miner's interest groups outside the reach of any core-dev, hence very dangerous to open this Pandora's box.


I think all stakeholders should hold on for a while, take a step back, and think about what structures and decision paths are the best and most robust for Bitcoin's future, and where it is worth making a compromise on one's own ideals in the interest of the great common idea. In this sense, I'd like to finish with a quote from an esteemed fellow, and ask everyone really on all sides of the playing field to stay flexible and willing to change or adapt one's own opinions - and I know this is not easy - but you all carry a high responsibility:

610,"Not sure if this kind of thing is taboo to discuss, but I'm interested in learning about arbitrage. Is there a bot that I could practice using to become adept at it?"
611,"When Bitcoin was first created, every full node was a miner. And every full node was using the CPU to find blocks. And most were successful at this because the difficulty was extremely low (compared to today). But as more and more people started using Bitcoin (and mining with their CPUs and GPUs), it became increasingly difficult and rare to find a block as a solo miner. 

Mining pools changed all that. Rather than finding an entire block on rare occasions, mining pools allow the miner to combine his hash power with the hash power of others to find blocks, and get a percentage of the reward. The mining pools which charged the lowest fees and had the largest combined hash powers were the most popular and users/miners would flock to these pools in droves. This resulted in unprecedented centralization of Bitcoin mining into a handful of mining pools that we see today. This was not something that Satoshi expected, and it has been one of the leading causes for people to stop running full nodes. A full node cannot hope to compete with mining pools with petahashes of combined ASIC hashpower. 

But there is one mining pool system that actually protects the decentralized nature of Bitcoin: P2Pool. This method for mining requires each miner to run their own full node, but rewards participating miners as if they were participating in a regular pool. This is a """"Good Thing (TM)"""". But setting up P2Pool is complicated, and doesn't really offer any benefit over running a competing mining software and connecting to some larger pool.

What if we could make it easier to participate in P2Pool? I would propose that Bitcoin Core/XT/NameYourForkHere each update their built-in solo-mining code, to make every full node a functional member of P2Pool BY DEFAULT. Allow full node operators the ability to earn a tiny amount of Bitcoin just for operating a full node. Even a CPU miner can mine some tiny amount of BTC as a member of P2Pool, especially if P2Pool is the overwhelmingly dominate pool. And if Core/XT/NameYourFork also added support for GPU/FPGA/ASIC devices right into the client, so that your copy of Bitcoin-QT is just as capable of connecting to some USB connected 100TH ASIC rig as specialized mining software and has the potential to earn bitcoin in small amounts over time, folks might take that simplest and most decentralized approach, and just mine the old-fashioned way... With a full node."

615,"What is the purpose of Bitcoin? Answering such a broad question requires an analysis of Bitcoin’s core principles. We know that Bitcoin serves as an alternative form of value exchange, but its purpose need not be limited to a monetary system. Bitcoin’s role as data storage and record keeping is also being explored. The underlying framework that makes Bitcoin possible is the blockchain. This distributed ledger maintains record of all transactions on the Bitcoin network. It is important to acknowledge the symbiotic relationship between the blockchain and Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s value incentivizes miners to maintain the blockchain and the blockchain provides a trusted means of keeping account. As a monetary system, Bitcoin’s value is dependent on what someone is willing to exchange for it. Bitcoin follows the law of supply and demand, so because its supply is finite we can assert its value is directly proportional to its demand. As merely a monetary system, Bitcoin’s story ends here, but what if there’s more to Bitcoin?

Bitcoin has been compared to innovations such as the Internet. This technology has changed our world so profoundly that we struggle to imagine life without it. The Internet can be defined simply as a global network that connects computers. Such a simplified definition fails to highlight the full potential of the Internet. Likewise, by defining Bitcoin as just a distributed global ledger we oversimplify this revolutionary technology. Instead, let us think broadly about Bitcoin’s potential purpose and application.

The Bitcoin system works because each participant follows the same Bitcoin protocol. Fundamentally, there is an uncanny similarity between this computing system and biological systems. In the same way that computers on the Bitcoin network follow the same instruction set, cells in an organism use the same DNA to operate. Bitcoin is like nothing we have ever seen before, so identifying more systemic similarities may prove to discover hidden potential. How does the Bitcoin network compare to our neural network? Both networks are structurally similar. They consist of nodes in the form of computers or neurons that are connected to every other node in the network. This similarity may appear to provide more support of the Internet’s likeness to neural networks; however Bitcoin operates within the framework of the Internet. This framework of cables stretching the globe is similar to the axons that connect neurons. The Internet parallels the infrastructure of neural networks while Bitcoin parallels the neurotransmitters within the network. A Bitcoin is identical to every other Bitcoin much like a molecule of serotonin is identical to any other molecule of serotonin. Bitcoin and neurotransmitters are both used in node to node transactions.

What is the purpose of these neurotransmitters? If we can answer this question, we might be a step closer to answering the purpose of Bitcoin. We know that molecules like serotonin and dopamine are used to communicate between neurons and that a neuron can only communicate to another neuron when there is an axon linking them. This understanding of neural networks provides a distinction between neural networks and Bitcoin. Bitcoin uses a distributed ledger to broadcast a node to node transaction across the entire network. This would be similar to a neural network if neurons could send neurotransmitters to any node on the network, but they can’t. The blockchain then appears to be an evolutionary step in network communication because it circumvents the challenge of limited connectivity that  neural networks experience. Is Bitcoin the next step in evolution?

It’s impossible for a neuron to conceptualize the complex system of consciousness. Likewise, it may be a similar infeasibility for a human to understand the higher level of complexity produced by a network of people, not neurons."

621,"This is a long post, beware. I am using a throwaway account.

So, I had this idea that I would move some money I received in my US account to my Japanese account.  I live in Japan currently and have an online account and a CC in the US.  I wanted to post this to illustrate how challenging this simple task is to move money through bitcoin.

My experience is rife with error.  I had to try different ways of doing it before getting it right, so it took me even more time to get it all done.  I will describe my final process and then talk about all the ways I went wrong. 

Using my CapitalOne360 account, I established a connection to Circle.com to buy bitcoin in the US.  This was an easy connection to make through the Circle.com website.
I bought bitcoin through circle and waited 4 business days to confirm the transfer of money.  I moved the money to btcbox, an exchange that has a high volume of trades for JPY.  I sold the btc into Yen and was able to withdraw the money to my Japanese postal bank account within a few days.   That is the simplest description, but the reality is much more security ridden.

In oder to setup my btcbox account, I had to photograph my ID and deal with customer service a little to make sure my name and address matched exactly.  It was not as painful as Kraken, which has several """"tiers"""" of security and requires additional work for the security clearance.  It also doesn't have enough volume to trade Yen.

The US side, though was a huge pain.  I originally tried to use coinbase for this, but coinbase does not allow foreign customers to connect accounts (even if I have a US address and bank account).  I thought about using a VPN, but decided it was not worth it.
I then went to Circle and tried to connect my Japanese credit card to the account.  I tried twice and then, I tried to connect my US CC account.  All three failed to connect, and I was told that I had to contact Customer Service to do anything else.  So, I did, and they gave me one more possibility to connect (which I didn't want to waste).

I originally had my money in HSBC account.  They would not allow me to do electronic transfers or wire transfers without taking enormous security precautions.  I had so much trouble getting through their security boondoggle that I ended up opting to be sent their hardware security device.  I had to contact customer service twice, and I still could not get their security system setup until I was mailed the hardware.  It is just like Google Authenticator, but their own version.  I had to have it shipped to me from my US address.  This took way too long to get setup.
Once I had this setup, I tried connecting to Circle, but it would not take.  For some reason, I could not get the HSBC account and circle to connect so I had to open a new account with Capital One 360 to do it.
So, I thought I was going to have to contact Customer Service at Circle again due to too many failed connections, but I found that the Capital One 360 account connected without the need.
Finally, I was able to connect a US bank with Circle.com.
Then, the waiting started.  I connected my HSBC bank to the Capital One bank to do ACH transfer.  This connection took a few working days to finalize.  After that, I transferred the cash and this took another 4 working days to verify.  Then, I bought bitcoin on Circle, and this took another 3-4 working days to verify.
The whole process took a month or more of time.  A lot of that time was spent because I made some mistakes and had to redo some parts of the process.  A lot of the time was also spent because of high security checks and the ACH system of financial transfers.

In the end, now that it is setup, it is easy.  I can transfer money back and forth without hitch and I can beat the exchange rate with this because there is no exchange firm taking a cut.  I am happy with it, but it was a frustrating process to get it all set up.

I am posting this for those who may wish to do the same, but also for devs to see how they can streamline the process, or perhaps explain to the laymen easy ways to do it."

From: J Dawe &lt;ugliest@outlook.com&gt;
Subject: yyy email setup

Need old account inbox back.
Can you setup the email xxx@yyy.zzz for me? Will pay you if needed
----- Excerpt ends -----

I replaced some parts with xxx, yyy, and zzz. The """"From:"""" name and email address used by the attacker is the real one though.

The email was addressed to the mail server administrator, whom I know very well, so the scam did not work on me.

The purpose is clear. The attacker wants to make the email admin change the inbox setup such that now he, instead of me, receives the emails and can thus take control of the BTC-e account connected to the email address.

I would like to know how the attacker could learn the email address in the first place. It looks a bit like an inside job, like a BTC-e clerk who has access to some account data trying to subvert accounts through an outside helper or some such.

In any case, be warned. Make sure that nobody else can take over your email account by tricking your email administrator."

630,"The first item in [BIP 100's](https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/master/bip-0100.mediawiki) """"motivation"""" section is:

&gt;Long term, wean the bitcoin protocol away from any block size limit; let the free market establish a natural size limit equilibrium.

In Jeff's [PDF](http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf), there is a lot of rhetoric about the free market:

&gt;This change moves from centralized management of the fee market to free­market control, improving bitcoin’s governance by removing a hardcoded policy control from the software

&gt;A key goal, therefore, is to transition the speed limit from software control to market control. Remove the policy wedge. Let the free market decide the long term shape of bitcoin’s transaction fee market, level of security and level of decentralization.

The problem is that BIP 100 doesn't actually put the block size under free market control.

Wikipedia defines a free market as:
&gt;a market economy system in which the prices for goods and services are set freely by consent between vendors and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority.

In BIP 100, supply (of block space) is not free from intervention because it is being controlled by a cartel.

A free market would be a situation where there is no max block size at all, but this is likely not desirable because such a market has many externalities. 

First, miners don't bear the direct [costs to the network](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Against_large_blocks#Transactions_have_negative_externalities_which_higher_fees_keep_in_check) of including a transaction. They also don't bear the full [costs to decentralization](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Against_large_blocks#Decentralization) that large blocks could pose. Miners also don't bear the full [costs to growth](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/For_large_blocks#Growth) of blocks that are too small.

**TLDR: BIP 100 claims to put block size under control of a free market but puts it under control of a cartel instead.**"
631,"Hi! I'm very new to bitcoin. I don't really have much experience in it and am trying to get around the headache of using a wallet and get into this. Nearly every FAQ suggests CoinBase, but, CoinBase requires you to wait 7 days? 

Is this normal for Bitcoin, to wait seven days before you can use the funds for anything? Coinbase required me to use my bank account, won't even let me use a debit/credit card. I canceled at the last second because it told me my funds wouldn't be available until September 14th. I find this wait to be unacceptable.

Does anyone else have any other recommendations and any tips that are broken down for dummies, like me? 

Sorry! this annoyed me! I was trying to pay an invoice today! Guess, I'll use PayPal instead for it! Saw the merchant had bitcoin as a way and decided to finally try it. :/ Seven day wait does not seem worth it for a $10 item. "
632,"So today, I've been dabbling in bitcoin for the first time since 2012. I've noticed that a lot has changed over the past few years, e.g., if you use something like MultiBit (which I just did), you no longer have to download the entire block chain (which is nice!).

I'd like to try out my new MultiBit wallet, but another slight change in the world of bitcoin is that there are no longer any  faucets that *instantly* dispense infinitesimal amounts of bitcoin. They all have minimum payouts, and so would require a significant waiting period--and a fair bit of effort--before I actually saw any Satoshis appear in my wallet.

So I guess what I'm asking is this: Would any one be willing to send me a teeny-tiny amount of BTC, just so I can verify that my wallet is functioning properly? NOTE: I realize that, ideally, you'd get something in return for your mini-payment. So: If anyone is willing to do this, I will share a bitcoin-themed poem that I wrote.

ALSO: I'd like to buy about $75 worth of bitcoin, and I was hoping that it could be in my wallet by tomorrow at noon EST. Is this kind of speed possible? If so, how?"

I've purchased the domain Unbanked.xyz to create this resource. I intend it to be not only a one-stop place to learn how to live on crypto, but also to be a continuously publishing blog (think clickworthy posts like """"10 Reasons to Ditch Your Bank Account"""", """"8 Ways to Save Money Using Bitcoin"""", etc.) I'm a blogger, and so will write all the content myself.

I'm familiar with Wordpress and can certainly navigate it on my own, but I fear that its basic pre-built templates would be insufficient for Unbanked.xyz's navigational needs.

So here's my ask: would anyone here be willing to donate a handful of hours to customize a web design for me, which I can then populate into The Crypto Economy's Most Useful Guide? I'm also very open to just being pointed to pre-built templates which you think would serve the purpose.

Thank you. Please private message me."
635,"1.  Technologically, BTC is and has been stuck in the dark ages of the blockchain.  With 6 years and 101 BIPs, you expect some major bug fixes and improvements on the protocol.  But the developers haven't even fixed a major DOS vulnerability that even litecoin has fixed!  And the block size debacle is ridiculous.  The correct solution is to implement GHOST and improve the block generation rate to 3-15 seconds/block without sacrificing security, not to risk the whole system being bogged down by giant blocksizes or to risk &lt;51% attacks!  But nope... Major changes to the protocol have never been implemented by the dev team.  I got into Bitcoin because it was technologically superior to fiat, and now there are other coins that are technologically superior to Bitcoin.

2.  Your community sucks.  Drama everywhere.  Almost no discussion of core technology!  Long time faces getting up and leaving.  Censorship of discussion.

3.  Most of the infrastructure of Bitcoin is opensource.  It can and has been cloned by alt coins.  Bitcoin has 1, and only 1 advantage:  the number of users, which hasn't been growing very much."
636,"Let's say a whole new cryptocurrency evolves on a sidechain - let's call that s-coin for now. Does that mean s-coin only needs to be linked to a single Satoshi on the bitcoin blockchain? In other words, can 100m sidechains be created using 1 btc?

There's been far too much good press about the blockchain recently. My cousin works for a massive investment bank and has always been dismissive of Bitcoin, but even he is now saying its all about the blockchain - not bitcoin. 

I'd like to know what the possibilities are of the Bitcoin blockchain succeeding, but bitcoin the currency failing. Is there any type of scenario where this can happen? I'd love to be able to respond to my cousin and obliterate his argument. "
637,"First let me say that I admire Gavin. And I have no idea what to believe with all the gossip regarding Mike. I do personally believe that programmers should never make product development decisions. I've been really vocal about that numerous times.

Nevertheless, I do recall for the last four years, always being under the impression that if bitcoin wants to scale, it needed some way to do so without putting the core code at risk. 

The person who's opinion I value the most (Andreas)?  I remember him constantly talking about services being built """"on the edges"""". Being built on top of bitcoin. 

Where the protocol itself fell short, products and services built on top of the protocol is where it would shine.

That was the mantra for years and years. 

Then the question kept coming up: how are we going to do that? And then someone came up with a brilliant idea:  Side chains. 

I was one of the people shouting it from a mountaintop on Twitter back then. Finally we had our way to scale bitcoin and build endless products and services on top of it. 

Just like with the Internet. You don't continually enhance TCP/IP do you? You build Amazon.com for shopping. You build Etrade for an entire ecosystem of stock trading.  

Then this whole fight came about. And even I jumped the bandwagon. I thought:  whats with all the censorship? And I defected to the new Bitcoin subs.  Oh - and why don't the programmers want Bitcoin to succeed? Etc. etc. 

But then it hit me again recently: I thought we were going to make Bitcoin awesome with sidechains, on top of the protocol?  Just like the Internet. 

So what am I missing here? When did the dialogue completely change from the brilliant introduction of sidechains, to this talk fear of centralized services.  And where was all this fear about centralized services when sidechains came about, and we were suddenly able to build products and services on top of the protocol? 

And I could've sworn even guys like Gavin were on board with """"building products and services on top of the protocol"""" where the protocol fell short."
638,"I do have a knowledge of basic economics that prices are determined by supply and demand but I can't see why Bitcoin prices continue to fall day after day. Obviously the previous peak in 2013 was a bubble where Bitcoin was ridiculously overvalued however, surely after almost 2 years the price has recovered to a more suitable equilibrium. Thus if the price is not over or undervalued and more and more people are using it each day (increasing demand) what is driving the price continually down? Surely it's not an oversupply issue. And it is not an issue with strengthening currencies as Bitcoin is losing value against all currencies even the weak ones. I'm interested to see what people think about this. I personally remain long term bullish on Bitcoin prices but I just can't explain what's going on in the short term. Anyone have any idea?"
639,"I understand that long term, in the case of a deflationary cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin the one thing that will keep the system going will be transaction fees, and that they are there to somewhat curb spam transactions, but I believe under other rules it should be possible to have a 0 fee tx. cryptocurrency.

Email, despite being centralized, and despite the size in bytes of emails, and their attachments, and despite the petabytes of spam that are sent day by day is free.

how come we have to pay so much for ~255 byte sized transactions? (specially since those fees go around like a lottery for block solvers and they're not evenly distributed to all participants) Doesn't the value provided by the possibilities enabled by such an awesome system like Bitcoin merit the costs of everyone running their nodes? just like email service operators make money indirectly from their services, why couldn't professional network participants build atop Bitcoin and monetize on it to keep everyone's transaction fees free?"

644,"all we have right now are some short term loans, loans on bitfinex and polinex are swamped with supply because its literally the only financial product on the market. I can trade my dollars for stocks, securieties, bonds, and any number of financial products. 

i was excited for the overstock.com IPO because the owner was interested in using bitcoin to IPO. "
645,"Disturbing title? - Ok, I will explain what I mean, I think after that it gets clear that it is not as crazy as it looks.

Imagine for a while the Bitcoin protocol does not know any limits on the block size. How will the (Bitcoin-)world look like? Does it mean, a miner can mine a 1 GB block (assuming mem-pool is large enough) and get it accepted into the block chain? Probably not. Such a big block will not only take long to propagate and validate, so other miners are likely to find and successfully propagate a smaller block in the meantime, thereby overtaking the large one.

There is also likely a (secret or public) """"best practice"""" sort of non-binding but practically effective agreement between the big miners that they won't accept blocks bigger than what is no more reasonable (1GB / 300 MB / 100 MB or whatever). So, assume the 5 major miners announce via a signed letter to the community, they met together and agreed they won't accept blocks larger than 100 MB, what would happen if some (other) miner sends a 200 MB block (height = N+1) to the network? Well, this block, when passing through the network, will be rejected by those miners. I.e., these miners will still run their miners on top of block height N, and since they are the majority, the block of 200 MB size will have no chance to be incorporated in the longest chain - so it will orphan. Hence, all other miners (not only those 5 big ones who signed the letter) will also mine blocks &lt;100MB, unless they are stupid and like to waste profits.

Of course, there could be other, more implicit, agreements on what max. block size each miner is willing to accept. Instead of publicly announcing something, they can also each pursue their own strategy, and by observing how the others behave, can adapt. This would yield a certain orphan rate due to large blocks, because not every miner hits the right point.

There could also be a point in between, i.e. informal meetings between miner CEOs where they talk about their de-facto cut-off lines of block size, or some """"big-miner"""" mailing list, or some other means of communication. In that case, smaller miners who are not part of those discussions are of disadvantage because they lack a piece of information about what the latest accepted block size is. Hence more centralization tendency.

Whatever method we imagine - all methods have one thing in common: There is some sort of - explicit or implicit - agreement between a majority of miners on the de-facto max. block size. In best case, the most explicit case, they announce it publicly, and at what block height it takes effect. In worst case, there is no coordination at all or some secret agreement on secret communication channels. 

----

Ok, now what is voting on block size limit? Actually, what I described above *is* voting, it is a sort of voting, albeit not via the block chain. It is a tedious process of talk, writing, negotiations, meetings etc., before an agreement is reached, and that has to be updated regularly. And if no agreement is reached, we have this chaos with more orphans and more uncertainty.

The alternative is a voting procedure inside the blockchain. It effectively achieves the same thing, just in a more fair, more transparent way, and with less overhead and cost: Each miner simply announces in his own mined block his most preferred block size limit in a formalized way. Compared to the formerly mentioned method, this is utmost simple, most fair, fully transparent, and does not cost any particular effort whatsoever.

That's it, actually!

----

**Appendix**: What would be a most """"fair"""" voting &amp; blocks size limit adjustment mechanism? Is BIP-100 a candidate?

I think BIP-100 can be improved. BIP100 is coarse: It requires 80% majority for even the tiniest block size limit adjustment, but then can achieve adjustment steps as big as 20% per 2-weeks (i.e. multiply by 114 per year) with the same majority.

Why shouldn't we allow a stable 55% majority to at least increase the block size limit at a rate of 4% per year? (which is WAY below any technological growth curve), for example.

A generalization of BIP-100 is more reasonable, the exact parameterization of the following proposal is to be debated (BIP-100 being one particular sub-case), but in principle voting should follow this single simple rule:

**A small majority can adjust the block size limit slightly, a huge majority can adjust the limit by a bigger leap.**

Illustration:

     block
     adjustment
     per 2-weeks
     [%]

Concrete example:

* A 55% majority can adjust by up to 0.1% per 2-weeks (+/-2.6% p.a.)

* A 60% majority can adjust by up to 0.5% per 2-weeks (+13.8%/-12.2 p.a.)

* A 65% majority can adjust by up to 1.0% per 2-weeks (+29.5%/-23.0% p.a.)

* A 70% majority can adjust by up to 1.6% per 2-weeks (+51%/-34% p.a.)

* A 75% majority can adjust by up to 2.7% per 2-weeks (+100%/-51% p.a.)

* A 80% majority can adjust by up to 10% per 2-weeks (x11.9/-94% p.a.)

* A 90% majority can adjust by up to 20% per 2-weeks (x114/-99.7% p.a.)

647,"I was thinking, what were the earliest bitcoin mentions in the mainstream media. Any recollections?"
648,"Fellow Pirates,
I've an idea that will change the reinsurance industry and pave way to possibility of an insurance DAO in near future. Reinsurance is simply put insurance of an insurer. When an insurer needs to protect itself from an extreme event like an earthquake or hurricane they buy insurance from an reinsurer. Similarly reinsurer purchases protection from Retrocession which is insurance of reinsurer. Goes without saying that it is a very bureaucratic and specialized market where deals are executed behind closed door and corporate relationship is the linchpin to success. More recently there was a surge of ILS products where hedge funds are using derivatives backed by treasury to execute deals. The ILS markets grew exponentially over the last 5 years and it needs to be noted the regulations in this field is more relaxed than insurance or banking. I've been with the industry for 11 years and located in Bermuda which is a lead jurisdiction for reinsurance. There are a few characteristics which makes reinsurance an ideal candidate for crypto disruption:
1. ILS products are often index based which means an unambiguous claims settlement. However it is rather expensive and too many counterparties/third parties involved (e.g. lawyers, banks, brokers) that increase the cost significantly
2. Regulations are relatively lax and reinsurance have developed mostly in offshore locations
3. Contracts and structures more or less standard across the industry which rarely changes

My idea would be to take reinsurance to the next level where the reinsurance liabilities can be attached to a crypto coin and traded. DAO can be the final objective, however I know being in the industry that it will take time and further development of a underwriting suite (which will take 1 year atleast) to set up the DAO.

649,"I'd it possible for bitcoin to remain the settlement layer (the more valuable """"slow money"""") while anther crypto such as LTC (backed by BTC) takes the place of smaller transactions? This seems like a good way to allow innovations like lightning networks to evolve and still have a morning-coffee blockchain. Without risking real threat to decentralization.

I've been contemplating investing in BTC for a while now - not a lot of money, I'm a student, but maybe just buying around 2-3 BTC and hope they'll be worth more in  6-12 months.

Do any of You guys do that, and has it paid off? Would it be possible to buy a couple BTC using an exchange and then exchange them for dollars immediately when the price goes up? 

I'd also like to hear what exchanges You guys recommend. Hard to keep up with all the ones closing / getting hacked / not updating canaries.

Also, this idea might be very stupid, if so please tell me ;-)

Reload allows users to link a wallet or a LocalBitcoins account on one side with a selected bitcoin exchange on the other. It automates rebuying of sold bitcoins and provides insightful reporting -- both features crucial for successful and streamlined reseller business in a highly volatile market.

The service is anonymous and secure. API access on LocalBitcoins and exchanges only requires low-level permissions. Reload never touches users’ coins. It will re-buy bitcoins right after the release of a contact, when the sale and amount is confirmed. For now the Reload service is also completely free for use with no restrictions."
658,"Bitcoin is at a turning point. Early in its infancy the creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a block size limit (1mb), saying the project was too small to defend itself with bigger blocks.

The idea was in the future the limit would be increased, by a community consensus. But even then a few people caught on to the ramifications and protested. If bitcoin blew up and got mainstream, convincing an entire community that is growing daily would be increasingly more difficult.

Satoshi never responded to the complaints.

Fast forward to the present and bitcoin is faced with a conundrum: 1mb blocks cannot support enough transactions for everyone to use bitcoin. Bigger blocks are needed, HOWEVER, bigger blocks necessarily effect the security of bitcoin.

Bitcoin seemingly has a choice, have large blocks and become owned by a few large corporations

Or

Become a very costly to use payment network that is ultra secure but too expensive to be used for average transactions.

The community has learned they cannot have their cake and eat it too, bitcoin is to be either and only a coffee money, or a new digital gold (high value settlement lay), but not both...

My thoughts are that the major banks will never approve of the current distribution of coins where millions are in the control of unknowns. This poses a considerable liquidity risk; should they suddenly decide to sell. 

This leads me to believe there may be in the future a shared bank altcoin system for swift payment transactions. Obviously in this scenario the current instance of bitcoin is mostly a tool for black market trade. In any other legal scenario I can only see it to become monopoly money, or rather only valued by its market share. Which may of course be a billion or more, but not much more. 

So, do you think this current instance of bitcoin is purely a proof of concept? "
661,"I've been using circle for some time generally purchasing between 2 and 3 bitcoins every other week to avoid bank fees for using atm's in the country I am working in.

662,"Here are some thoughts on solving an issue with price stability which could in turn have benefits in getting more people interested in Bitcoin.

The problem as I see it is that Bitcoins price is being controlled by a handful of exchanges that lack sufficient liquidity to provide price stability by themselves.

What Bitcoins needs is a way to pool liquidity of all the exchanges so that Bitcoin is being traded on any given day within the same pool like the Forex market. The fact we can still have an episode where a rogue exchange like we saw with MtGox run Bitcoins price up or down on nothing but hot air is an issue that needs addressing.

We have wash trading going on in China, we have spreads that go as wide as a full $10, think the Btc-e vs Bitfinex spreads we have margin cascades that run havoc with price we have thin liquidity to an extent that a person using very little funds and margin at their disposal can do as they please. 

Because liquidity is so thin on these independent exchanges the price is being moved around more like a penny stock pump and dump than a currency or commodity. I realize there will be episodes like in any currency or commodity where you see strong price movements but this will be done so in a way that is not exchange independent. 

There simply isn't enough liquidity at the moment for loosely regulated independent exchanges who offer margin products to dictate the price of Bitcoin. Trading Bitcoin day in day out can be a total snooze fest, I wouldn't see this as a problem if we pooled liquidity. 

Personally I can't believe the miners and the exchanges have not gotten together to address this problem which would not only benefit the Bitcoin ecosystem by attracting more users to Bitcoin by way of price stability and legitimacy. What I'm calling for is the centralized processing of orders so that price is being traded from the same page and not independently.

I read a lot about the price of Bitcoin about how to get more people to use it and how to stabilize Bitcoins price which seems to be one of the biggest hindrances for people considering adopting Bitcoin.

The price of Bitcoin is in the hands of fully independent thinly liquid exchanges offering margin products, well this for me is a serious issue that if solved will get a lot more people on board.   "
663,"All i read is bitpay reduced his staff, and the arguments that the payment processor bitpay failed. (Some are even telling us that the retail market for bitcoin payments has failed - because bitpay failed *facepalm*)

You are all ignoring the fact that bitpay is not just a payment processor - take a look at https://github.com/bitpay - tell me who was developing all that free software? - Yeah indeed its software developed by bitpay developers!

Bitpay tried to give something back to the bitcoin community with all that software they developed out of their own pockets, with their own developers. FOR FREE!

And now it looks like they (at least the management of bitpay) is not happy anymore with the """"give it for free"""" plan. - That's why they need much less staff.

In my opinion its a rational business decision based on profit and costs - their payment processor model has likely almost nothing to do with this decision, the payment processor will generate revenue even without the developer personal, the free developing stuff in contrast will cost much money and will not bring any profit in the near future, at least not if its for free.

-&gt; so they tried to expand their business to bitcoin software development and someone in management is not happy with paying all the developers without any revenue coming from their tasks. so why not just reduce staff? - what has that to do with the payment processor itself? Please enlighten me."

668,"Its about energy, or rather the cost to produce some commodity. All this time we gain effeciencies until our social construct changes, evolves, adapts...and then we pour over into the next paradigm.  Spilling over until the damn breaks.

Energy changes depending on our views, our wants and our needs.  Efficiency then is subjective too, and then so is the cost of production. 

Bitcoin uses electricity, and thus a stable money would have a function relatable to this. But of course as miners migrate to more cost efficient areas, and electrical energy evolves towards its pertinent limits, there arises alternative sources of mining energy.

To make an ideal money we want some form of a predictable decay in issuance that matches the predictable declining costs of production.  So what then, is fueling our social reality?  In other words, how fast are we going, evolving, adapting?  How efficient are we becoming?

What is the predictable rate that we can use to predict an ideal money supply?"

683,"Everytime I raised the topics about Qiwi/Yandex.Money/Sberbank.Online/WebMoney - you supported this.

But I still don't get, why there's no Bitcoin companies who cares about International market?

And I raise this question, not because I dumb and think that Russia is the only country on our planet. But because this community has 0 intentions on speaking real user language.

80% of you located in U.S. And I know that you know that there's other countries exist. But it doesn't means that other countries payments work the same way like U.S. payments.

Here in Russia only tiny % of Internet users use Visa/Mastercard. We already got our own """"Bitcoin"""". You want Russian audience to learn to speak """"Bitcoin"""" language? That's a very selfish. Russia has no problem speaking Qiwi/Yandex.Money/Sberbank.Online/WebMoney language for already decade now, almost since the beginning of the Internet in Russia.

I've read recent article on why remittance services in Bitcoin aren't cheapest yet. That guy said that there's an important concept of **last mile** (term comes from telecommunication business and existed for describing role of intermediaries who communicate with customer)

So let me give you example. I'm sitting here in Russia with my friends, and trying to show them new features on how to use these services: Purse.IO, Lawnmower, Leet, Provistor, soon I will show them OpenBazaar, WatchMyBit, ShapeShift, FoldApp, etc and many other awesome services. But most of them use Qiwi/Y.M./Sber/WM - they would be glad to try some new financial apps, but all they got is these 4 systems. And instead of enjoying user experience, I have to explain them how to sign up on LocalBitcoins, how to wait 3 confirmations to do what? To use some service? Come on. This is not worths it. It gives bad impression to people, because process gets complicated.

Payments systems are like language. Okay, I know you want to show everybody importance of using Bitcoin. But its the same like importance of teaching everybody of speaking Chinese and explaining benefits of such ancient language.

So at the end of 2015 (almost 2 months before 2016) I don't know even 1 bitcoin company that works with Russian systems.

Lets consider reconsider money properties again with http://moneyandstate.com/role-bitcoin-money/ article based on famous Erik Voorhees Bitcoin scarcity introduction video:

~Erik Voorhees: *So how does this relate to Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s value as money needs to be understood like gold, which comes not from legal force, but from its specific attributes. Bitcoin’s attributes make it an amazing form of money and it was engineered for just that purpose:*

- *It is easy to divide and recombine* - okay but keeping rubles in Qiwi is also divisible enough, most Russian customers will agree with me, because they can basically send such small amounts as 1 ruble without paying fee to anyone, while in Bitcoin most of the time miner fee is 2 ruble

- *It cannot be counterfeited* - Qiwi also can't be counterfeited

- *It is highly durable, so long as certain precautions are taken* - I wouldn't trust storing for 10 years large amount of funds to Qiwi and Yandex.Money, but I would trust storing them to WebMoney, Sberbank.Online - because of their established reputation (+many people already did that)

- *It can be sent anywhere, instantly, at near-zero cost* - yep you can send rubles anywhere in Russia, instantly, at zero cost (without any """"nears"""" its completely free)

- *If you were going to make a super hero currency, this is one of the traits you would give it*

- *Can’t do that with gold due to physical constraints, or dollars due to legal constraints*

Also I can add from myself, that Qiwi/Sber/WM/YM is **Instant**, **without fees**, **irreversible**, almost **anonymous** and currently have way better **UX** than Bitcoin (sorry, but that's a sad truth, we still got plenty space to grow). But most important is that those systems are **recognizable** by 90% of Russian population. Seriously, I can pick 5 random our-local-craigslist ads with people selling an iPhone or computer or whatever, and 4 of them is going to accept Qiwi/Sber/WM/YM as a payment! It works just like Cash!

Yes I understand that inflation will eat my rubles at the rate of 15% or more per year.

Yes I understand that Bitcoin can be sent globally, I love it.



I am myself perfectly fine with Bitcoin. But 99% of users in Russia don't have the same opinion as me. They don't get Bitcoin most of all, because Bitcoin companies doesn't speak our language. And because Qiwi/Sber/WM/YM is still more superior than Bitcoin because it has 90% user adoption.

And by our language I mean exactly taking as payment those 4 providers.

I'm not sure if this applies to other countries, but I tried to research that and found out that Malaysia also have internal online banking apps which works better than Bitcoin for them.

I don't know what to do exactly. But maybe we need some sort of payment gateways for Bitcoin, which would specifically work with third-party payments systems to give user smoother user experience. This doesn't betrays Bitcoin idea, because in this case we serve people - otherwise they wouldn't get such services.

It never did. I watched it climb and climb until I finally bought back in around $100, netting me 8 BTC.

On September 29th I created a Coinbase account using a referral link while their bonus program was for $75 to the referring party.  I immediately initiated a qualifying balance transfer from my bank and received a notice that my Coinbase account should be funded the next week.  Of course, no referral bonus was paid out until the funds cleared my account – not a problem.  When the bonus was finally paid out however, I received $10 and the referrer received $10 as well.  Turns out they changed their referral program on the 30th.  That doesn't matter to me, though.  I accepted an offer on the 29th, they changed the bargain on the 30th and in turn are costing me money.  

They claim that they can change the terms of the program at any time.

Like any other write-up it likely contains personal biases, although I try to stay as neutral as I can.  
There are no decisions being made in these meetings, so if I say """"everyone agrees"""" this means everyone present in the meeting, that's not consensus, but since a fair amount of devs are present it's a good representation.  
The dev IRC and mailinglist are for bitcoin development purposes. If you have not contributed actual code to a bitcoin-implementation, this is probably not the place you want to reach out to. There are many places to discuss things that the developers read, including this sub-reddit.

[Meeting minutes by meetbot](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-dev/2015/bitcoin-dev.2015-10-15-19.01.html)


Main topics discussed where:  
  
Mempool limiting   
sendheaders BIP  
versionbits  
dev/discuss list policy  
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY  



**Mempool limiting**

- background  

When a transaction is relayed across the network it is held by the nodes in memory, until it gets into a block. All these transactions that sit in memory are called the memorypool or mempool for short.  
Like we could see during the spam-attack if there's a big back-log of transactions that couldn't make it in the blockchain this mempool can get pretty big resulting in nodes crashing.  

To stop this from happening devs are trying to find a way to limit this mempool, so a mechanism to reject and/or remove transactions from the mempool. The hard part here is to make it so nodes can't be attacked by abusing this mechanism.  
So far the devs are going with TheBlueMatt's proposal of [throwing away the cheapest txn and setting the min relay fee to it](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722)


- meeting comments

While testing, sipa encountered transactions that took 200ms to be accepted into the mempool.  
As it's the first time he has benchmarked this and the pull-request shouldn't make an impact on these times it likely doesn't have anything to do with this. However, such times are bad either way.  
The average time in sipa's tests is 4ms. (After the meeting Morcos did some [benchmarking](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722#issuecomment-148874040) and confirmed it was not specific to this PR, and pointed out the outliers come from CheckInputs and HaveInputs (as you might guess, having to do with checking the inputs)  
Question on why we should revert the minrelay (minimum fee for nodes to relay a transaction) back to 1000 (it has been set to 5000 to quick-fix the mempool issues), sipa thinks it should be floating as well or the dust limit becomes ineffective.


- meeting conclusion  

Review PR 6722 [Limit mempool by throwing away the cheapest txn and setting min relay fee to it](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722)  
Morcos/sipa will do some more benchmarks and comment on the PR ( [morcos' benchmark results](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722#issuecomment-148874040) )


**sendheaders BIP**

- background  

[send headers BIP](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bips/blob/add-sendheaders/bip-sendheaders.mediawiki)  
Copy/paste from the BIP:  
Since the introduction of """"headers-first"""" downloading of blocks in 0.10, blocks will not be processed unless they are able to connect to a (valid) headers chain. Consequently, block relay generally works as follows:

1. A node (N) announces the new tip with an """"inv"""" message, containing the block hash   
2. A peer (P) responds to the """"inv"""" with a """"getheaders"""" message (to request headers up to the new tip) and a """"getdata"""" message for the new tip itself  
3. N responds with a """"headers"""" message (with the header for the new block along with any preceding headers unknown to P) and a """"block"""" message containing the new block  
However, in the case where a new block is being announced that builds on the tip, it would be generally more efficient if the node N just announced the block header for the new block, rather than just the block hash, and saved the peer from generating and transmitting the getheaders message (and the required block locator).

 

- meeting comments

Question on how to move forward. How to let the nodes know you want the blockheader instead of the blockhash.  
Options:  

1. Extend the [version message](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#version).  
2. Have an """"options"""" message that can send flags.  
3. Send a """"sendheaders"""" message early when connecting so the way peers want their block announcement is immediately known.  
4. Send a """"sendheaders"""" message at any time, changing the way peers want their block announcement from hashes to headers.

No one likes to extend the version message further.  
There's no strong advantage to have an """"options"""" message over a """"sendheaders"""" message.  
Having the message being sent early on might be too constraining. Possible usecase from morcos: """"its entirely possible some future optimization may say, i want to send sendheaders to these peers b/c they announce a lot of new stuff to me and not these others b/c they don't"""".  
Most people like this to be enable-only, so no message to get back to receiving blockhashes. Which is how the BIP was drafted.  

 
- meeting conclusion

sdaftuar does a pull-request for the BIP to get a number assigned and proceeds with the BIP as drafted.



**versionbits**

- background

[BIP 9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki)  
Currently softforks have been done by the isSuperMajority mechanism, meaning when 95% of the last X blocks has a version number higher than Y the fork is deployed.   
A new way of doing this is currently being worked on and that uses all bits of the version number, appropriately being called versionbits. So instead of a fork happening when the version is larger than (for example) 00000000011 (3), a fork happens when (for example) the 3rd bit is up (so 00100000011).   
This way softforks can be deployed simultaneous and independent of each other. 

- meeting comments

copy/paste from IRC, since I don't know what this specifically means:   
CodeShark: so right now it's just a unit that implements the versionbits logic but does not demonstrate its usage   
I thought it would be better to actually integrate in a separate PR, but I can add a demonstration   
sipa: separate commit, same PR - i think we need something that's mergable as a whole, to be able to see whether the whole thing easily backports

Codeshark (who's implementing versionbits) had some more remarks but no one present had seemed to reviewed it, so not much use in discussing things further.


- meeting conclusion

review [versionbits implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6816)


**dev/discuss list policy**

- background

The bitcoin-dev mailing list is intended for technical discussions only. There's things that don't belong there but need to be discussed anyway.  
Now this is done in bitcoin-dev, but the volume of this is getting too big.  
There's recently also an influx of really inappropriate posts, level [kindergarden](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg02539.html).  
For the things that don't belong on bitcoin-dev, but need to be discussed anyway there's a new list being created namely bitcoin-discuss as well as clear policies and moderation for both.

- meeting comments

Bitcoin-discuss was created, but the admin password wasn't distributed to jgarzik who's willing to guide the moderation.  
Seperate moderation-proposals have been done meanwhile.  
People just want it to move on.

- meeting conclusion

Since none of the people who proposed a moderation-scheme are present we'll let them discuss it among each other and post their decisions publicly.


**CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY**

- background

CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) repurposes the nSequence field (nSequence are 4 bytes intended for sequencing time-locked transactions, but this never got used). However, there's no way use these values in a bitcoin script.   
CheckSequenceVerify (CSV) makes this field accessible to bitcoin scripts.  

EDIT: [Turns out this is not entirely correct](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3pcinz/bitcoin_dev_irc_meeting_in_laymans_terms_20151015/cw55n6q) as it is [relative locktime](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) that repurposes the nSequence field. 

- meeting comments

CLTV is pretty much done.  
Check to see maaku moving one of the bits to allow for other implementations to have better granularity has any objections.  
As long as we're using as few bits as possible the exact semantics are less important for most people.   
sipa points out a possible [bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6312#discussion_r41899674) that influences the wallet.   
CSV is not on target for the end of of the month, although a lot of work and progress has been made.  



- meeting conclusion

Review and ACK/NACK of 6312 [BIP-68: Mempool-only sequence number constraint verification](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6312)   
Review and ACK/NACK of 6566 [BIP-113: Mempool-only median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566)

712,"Hello,
I am writing this with hope that someone else was in similar situation and found a solution.
So since I will go to college next year I decided that I should test my luck on betting sites and hopefully make a little bit of money. After some research I concluded that Cloudbet was the best site to bet one due to its bonus. So I deposited all my bitcoin to the site, but sadly It took very long for it to get confirmed and now that is been more than 24 hours since I made transaction(its completed now) and my cloudbet wallet is still empty. I wrote to support 7 hours ago and I havent received   answer yet. So yea all my bitcoin is gone (0.24069347 BTC)
It may not be much for most of you, but for me it was all I had in bitcoin and that amount of money is equal to 1/6 of minimum monthly wage in country where I live so thats definitely not nothing to me.
Anyways heres transaction details if that even matters Status: 78 confirmations

However, I also realize that there's a vast swathe of people out there who know far less than me, and have a desperate *need* to be informed about this stuff by an 'expert'.

Hope you can clear something up with me.

Originally I started buying bitcoins from Coinjar which are based overseas so apparently you don't have to pay GST when you purchase from them.

After a while I moved to BTC Markets because generally I could get coins cheaper from them.

The problem is BTC Markets are based in Australia which I believe means I am liable to pay GST on any purchases I make with them even though they don't actively collect the payment themselves.

Is this correct? Could the ATO chase me up down the track for not paying GST on these ealier purchases from BTC Markets?

If that is the case I may just stick with Coinjar and not worry about that happening.

Thanks in advance"
726,"I live in Colombia and my business has a software provider based out of Canada who suggested Bitcoin as a payment method. The idea was to eliminate the hassle of wire transfers and save a lot of money from currency exchanges. 

Never having used Bitcoin before, I sought help from someone I knew through Twitter who got me through the process of opening a wallet and getting set-up. Everything was very quick and very easy.

When I went to try purchase Bitcoins though...forget about it. My only option locally was through localbitcoins which led me to some well reffered users who had a mínimum fee of 25% per transaction. Trying to go through Canadian exchanges (CAVIRTEX) meant I had to provide ID, Passport, Utility Bill and a personal photo with the ID. 

I was quite disappointed. Everything I had heard about Bitcoin was so positive and easy. Anonymous, international...seems extremely far from the truth. It is an absolute nightmare to try get my hands on these and then I can't imagine how much more difficult it will be trying to get rid of them.

Has it always been like this, or have things tightened up? I realize my location likely does not help me, as I am unable to open accounts or access many of the big sites. Even with a VPN I am screwed because I don't have the numerous documents needed.

I forgot about the wallet.... then in 2013 I did the massive old hard drive plug-in spree trying desperately to find it... etc. No luck. I know the drive has drill holes through it and is in a landfill today. Honestly, no big deal.

I own some bitcoin today, as a curiosity, but I'm not particularly knowledgeable. I've always believed, and continue to believe that bitcoin price will go nuts, and stay nuts for a long time after the 21m event occurs, providing nothing terrible happens between now and then. I just assume between now and then, legitimate investment will cull out any leftover questionable bullshit tactics and operations and bitcoin will be a really cool thing forever.... so that's that.

But, I've been wondering - how many wallets are """"gone""""? How much of this digital currency is simply gone, as if paper money were incinerated? What impact will this have, and is it meaningful? Does bitcoin make any accommodation for this?  My assumption naturally is that more and more of this will happen for folks that don't use something like coinbase - I assume it's unavoidable.

Thoughts on this? Any interesting articles that look at this in-depth, etc? Just curious.

742,"It seems to me that as long as there are two or more uses of BTC, it will continue to have value. (Also, it would have to be *all* governments banning it.)

If BTC were used on some darkweb site, the sellers of drugs already have drugs so when they get BTC they want to be able to spend them and so there would have to be one thing you could buy with BTC other than drugs. That could be the services of escorts (many of whom use drugs, just like non-escorts.) And since both groups of sellers also receive fiat with which they can pay rent, I think BTC would continue to have value.

I think that this very limited use scenario would limit the value of Bitcoin and we are far from it. But if the goal in banning Bitcoin is to stop drug sales and prostitution, I can guarantee that it would not since both things predate BTC by centuries, even millennia."

They have $30 Million of funding but aren't engaging the community and I feel like they don't take us seriously - like they've reached this status of """"World's most popular Bitcoin wallet"""" and feel like all their work is done? I feel like they have a real big problem because anyone who knows of Blockchain.info doesn't really trust money with them. The only new people who are using them are people who haven't had the chance to be warned. I'm not trying to be mean by saying that, it's just the reality.

755,"I think many or most peoples wil be uncomfortable with this but I think that it needs to be pointed out.  Bitcoin as it stands today is set to evolve much like a religious movement that I must think any scientist or sincere human must detest.  The leader behind the movement is perfectly comparable to the story of Jesus or anything other religious leader in that there is a lot of lore and not a lot of facts.
And so unbeknownst to the innocent yet deceived community the true history of bitcoin is somewhat and quite shrouded in mystery and even deception. 
I myself have asked many times recently if I should be the one to try to code a p2 poker project (I'm clearly not capable), but I always feel uneasy because I still cannot know definitely that one person or a small group CAN change the world. 
I guess all in all what I mean to say is that although many people are quite comfortable with the true peoples and origins of bitcoin remaining a mystery, I myself do not want to live in a world where such accomplishments are necessary to go unclaimed.
Somebody, or some people did something AMAZING, this world should be talking about it and not which terrorist organization should receive what airstrike."
756,"It might have taken me some time before I could present a coherent argument and yet recent policy announcments by the poker industries status quo site (monopoly!) have shown thewealthofhips to be somewhat prophetic (although claiming to be scientific).  I myself came to understand bitcoin and the revolutionary changes we are witnessing in our global financial system through a series of lectures and papers entitled Ideal Money by John Nash.  I am still not always confident at all there can ever be shown a relationship between bitcoin Satoshi Szabo and Ideal Money, but it was Nash that got me thinking about the possible different and superior evolutions of money.

Straight up the introduction to Ideal Money suggests we have failed to understand money as a telecommunications. 

To me this is all quite relevant and significant because I think it can be shown that games necessary evolve out of the socio economic and technological level of their times. Nash proposes in Ideal Money a solution to our global financial problem known as the triffin dilemma. The basic point is that governments or central banks can't rationally serve the interests of the peoples. 

Nash proposes a solution to this problem he feels will levate a global standard of Ideal Money, and I do tend to agree with him.  But what is seemingly more urgent and important is that I feel I have shown that poker has inherited this same problem of the triffin dilemma, for what should be seen as a natural evolution. 

Then there are some important points to be extrapolated because I think in regards to massive reform and superior strategies of the peoples I think it is quite rational to suggest that poker will move and change first and be the first community to implement what is the suggestion and revelation of Nash's in regards to bringing about what will ultimately lead to Ideal Money.

In specific regards to poker and comparability of the problem the community faces, poker sites are increasingly seeking to make the game not skill-full by managing the profitability of it, while of course the poker professional will disagree with such policies it might be easy to see why the ignorant players might applaud such socialistic practices. 

I don't know if we understand what I mean to point out here about how such a collective group of game theorists will be the first to out game their Keynesian rulers. Cooperative strategies and solutions, brought about by the competitive nature and evolution and technology."

We were a part of the 2013 Bitcoin Black Friday campaign. It was a fun experience seeing the effective impact that campaign had on the value and understanding of bitcoin. Not only did it bring awareness to bitcoin but it strengthened my company's sales and essentially saved my company. With this first hand experience I have proudly become a bitcoin advocate, even naming our company dog [Bitcoin](http://i.imgur.com/TrZmaoZ.jpg?1).

Many things about bitcoin have changed since that time. Our retail sales with bitcoin have slowed down (A LOT) and its USD value dropped to a price that wasn't nearly as impressive as it was on Bitcoin BlackFriday 2013. Regardless of btc value my excitement for bitcoin has not slowed. The big picture for my company is that we can cut out financial middleman that cause our vendors (tea farmers) around 12% in fees due to the international movement of money. These farmers are already disadvantaged having to [compete in a commodity market](http://www.tching.com/2015/10/tea-is-our-lifeblood/). I also look forward to learning how the blockchain can help us facilitate things like certification of transparency and quality, traceability, and food safety.

It shows that bitcoin has been legitimately adopted by a significant population and there is value in this community. I hope [Bitcoin Black Friday 2015](http://bitcoinblackfriday.com) will be even more successful. But that also relies on you guys in the community.

&gt; Bitcoin with $20 fees would be a **failed experiment**, a brilliant idea corrupted by greed and economic stupidity. Its like someone inventing electric cars and assuming they could use them for a taxi service charging 10X or 20X normal rates.

66 * $0.30 = $19.80

If 66X more people adopted Bitcoin, assuming a current Bitcoin adoption level of 500,000 then 33,000,000 more people will have had to adopt Bitcoin before fees hit $19.80 assuming a 1MB block size and no deployment of Lightning or voting pools.

But today's average fee is closer to $0.03 than $0.30. And adoption levels are of course higher than 500,000.

When striving for fairness, it would take roughly 700X more people adopting Bitcoin for fees to rise to $20. For example, we can reasonably expect an influx of **700 million more people** before fees hit $20 - this is at 1MB blocks no Lightning."

Later that summer the BIG crash happened and it kinda blew my mind how much this video predicted it in ways...

Emergence implicates that all ideas are eventually updated, changed or eradicated.

So i contact customer service and get sorry we don't know why the order didn't finalize. Now as I stated above I got an order confirmation email showing it was fine and I watched the BTC leave my wallet and get accepted on their end. Now here's the kicker they won't refund my BTC and my choices are to either give them another $400 or get a refund in a Newegg gift card . So basically they have ganked my BTC and are forcing me to do business with them since they wont return my BTC to go elsewhere with my money and on top of that I have to wait for the gift card refund days possibly . Now I really would not care had they said ok here's your BTC back I'd take my business somewhere else but they are holding my funds hostage as we enter a holiday weekend where sales are galore and forcing me to buy from them when i finally do get a credit to my account . Anyone else see a problem here. This is not the first issue I have had with buying something with btc from newegg but it will sure be the last of me buying anything in any form of currency from them. They seem to want to straddle the fence on making the process smooth and painless while their agents know very little about BTC at all .

Once I noticed that gyft didn't reward me with my 5% points on my very large Amazon gift card purchase, I contacted the gyft support.

785,"back to $400 or another crash? wonder if this had something to do with black friday and how tomorrow being cyber monday will affect price. then again, there wasn't much black friday sales at all that accepted bitcoin so what gives?"
786,"I could be wrong.

I could be naive.

I could be suffering from irrational exuberance.

Bitcoin could end up a fad. A speculative bubble. A failed experiment in the
technological annals of the 21st century.

But I don't think it will.

I could try to convince you of the same. I would start with its technical
underpinnings, for example, mining and the blockchain. From there, I would
venture into more nebulous concepts such as trust and decentralization. I may
wave my hands during this part of the argument to keep you on board. Finally, I
would hide my meager understanding of monetary economics and show Bitcoin to be
a viable alternative to fiat currencies. Superior to the Euro, the Yen, or at
least the Zimbabwean Dollar.

But I'm not going to do that. You've heard it all before.

Instead, I'm going to jump to the next chapter. What if Bitcoin succeeds? What
if it becomes the currency of the Internet? A distributed, worldwide, digital
currency. Since I am convinced that Bitcoin will succeed, this is the chapter
that excites me the most.

At first glance, it all seems predictable enough. Bitcoin's value rises. And
rises. And rises. Its early proponents strike it rich(er). Those crazy
crypto-anarchists were right. Bitcoin takes a seat at the table of the world's
major currencies -- with the Dollar, the Euro, the Renminbi. Central Banks
diversify their holdings to include this new upstart. A """"pay-by-Bitcoin"""" option
appears on our mobile phones. The next James Bond villain is a Bitcoin early
adopter.

""""Off course this excites you"""", I hear you say. You have skin in the game.
Everyone dreams of striking it rich some day. The only difference is the means
by which we do it.

And I concede. You are right. I do have skin in the game. My wealth rises and
falls with the value of Bitcoin. But this is not what keeps me awake at night.
This is not why I am writing these words. The trouble is, if Bitcoin succeeds,
the future I describe above is not the one I foresee.

Do they want to increase the mining fees?
Do they have a threshold of fees that below it they will just generate empty block?

Edit:
I am not talking about the regular case where they generate a block few seconds after the previous one. They generate empty blocks 4 or 5 minutes after the previous one.

792,"Hello guys,

I am new to this bitcoin thing and never actually bought any. Recently my friend told me about a free market called openbazaar which is due to open soon. 
As an online vendor i find this project very appealing so much that i really wanna learn about bitcoin.

I was looking at the ways for my customers to buy bitcoin 
but could not find somewhere to buy them at market price without any additional fee.
I registered on coinbase but their instant credit card option does not work in my country and i guess their is a fee for that. So if i want bitcoin i need to send coinbase an international wire transfer which will cost me money and will take up to a week to be credited.
National bank transfer in my country UK are instant and free but i couldn't find any site like coinbase in the uk.
So my question is can buyers in UK buy bitcoin instantly without any fee?

796,"I'll keep it brief.  Learn the culture. That doesn't mean learn Chinese. Yesterday ALOT of folks rushed the stage after the panel and blew us up with questions and it became overwhelmingly obvious that the west doesn't get the culture. In general everyone's intentions were awesome, but the sheer excitement led to a big turn off by my brothers in arms. Top tip, be cool, reserved, non confrontational, and most importantly listen. Developers in the west have a hard time with that. When you suggest something, you need to be open to counter point. And not just open, but take it into account. Many folks are open but don't change their tune once a concern with a certain proposal has been suggested. The facts are, devs are better equipped and generally more skilled and making good core changes. Devs do not understand mining business models. Mine is different from Alex's and Alex's is more different than WuGang. These are my thoughts. I welcome counterpoint."
797,"So I decided to go **inform** a few local merchants of the new service they offer in my town, and of the 4 I visited, one actually looked at what he was being shown, followed the simple instructions on the screen, and then took my money and gave me my receipt. I went outside and sat down in my car and used the LibertyX App to redeem the PIN.

http://imgur.com/OtF89RO

This is a composite of the paper receipt I received, the transaction log on the LibertyX website, and the confirmed and completed deposit into my Coinbase account, with sensitive details redacted, but also with the timestamps highlighted.

3 minutes. I received my receipt and in 3 minutes had a confirmed bitcoin transaction added to my account. I lost around 7 bucks in the exchange from LibertyX to Coinbase with fees included, but I'm not sweating that at all. I would loved to have bought yesterday before the mini bull run in the evening, but such is life.

I think this is a great service, and it's about as easy as it gets to buy BTC. No deposit slips, no bank tellers, no fuss.

The three that I struck out on:

1) a girl of about nineteen that barely spoke English and was at work after dark by herself on the edge of a rougher neighborhood, and she just looked scared. She was unfamiliar and I just decided to go back when someone less worried would look up the Merchant in their system.

2) An old Hindi Grandpa running his son's store for the night who looked to have been pulling on a bottle for most of the day. He at least took a look at the terminal menu before saying he didn't have it in rough English. I think the more likely scenario was that he was too drunk to see straight and didn't want to fuck something up. Cool. I can dig it.

and

3) Some good ole redneck boy who was about twice as wide as he was high and took one look at the instructions in the app and said they hadn't updated their keypads to that model so he wouldn't even look. I'm guessing had he it would have been easy to find, but he was probably just too consumed in thinking about some hot dogs and donuts with a bowl of mayo.

All in all, this service is simple and straightforward, so much so that 3/4 Sunday PM shift attendants are terrified that it will get them fired, and one is totally stoked that the random neighborhood whitey just showed him where to buy his Bitcoins for his...party favors...

Give them a try, folks. You will not be disappointed, as long as you find an attendant that knows how to read and look at pictures. "
798,"One thing in life is certain and that is this simple fact: Things change.

""""meh, isn't that money for used for bad things online""""....... yeah but it can be used for mundane things as well and it's a much better store of value than the greenback in the cash register...""""meh, next""""....

I am conflicted whether #opsecfail or #opsecwantedtofail. The extortion evidence leans towards a simple fail (likely in trusting humanity).

807,"Just bought my lunch using menufy.com which takes bitcoin. 

Had a nice conversation with the pizza joint owner when I went in for pickup. He told me that when ordering online that you get charged an extra ($1.25) and that I should call it in. I told him I paid with bitcoin, so calling in wasn't an option. He tried to tell me they take all credit cards on the phone, so had to explain a little bit, that this wasn't the same thing :)

Anyway he was pretty happy that he got a new customer because of bitcoin, and we shook hands and I left (chicken grinder if you want to know). I don't mind paying a bit extra for the bitcoin experience.

I do wonder what will happen with RBF though, will places like menufy have to delay when they send the order to the merchant/vendors? Or will they just take the risk?"
808,"The Chinese Yuan is being devalued consistently since the IMF inclusion announcement a few days ago.

As more onshore and offshore yuan gets devalued, I'm assuming it's going to have a positive effect as more Chinese traders decide to hedge with Bitcoin.

There's a zerohedge article that came out days ago that was the first to show the trend. 

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-08/something-snaps-china-bitcoin-takes-out-stops-soars-higher

So, if the trend of devaluing the CNY against the USD continues to grow, I think the price of Bitcoin will keep growing at a steady pace.

Also, the sudden devaluing of the CNY back in August, indirectly caused the US stock market to crash. If they're playing a game of a """"stealth devaluation"""", which I think they are, chances are it's going to start a currency war that'll have far reaching consequences.

809,"When I was younger I was well-invested in the internet, I knew of everything ranging from UG to Very mainstream.


 Because of the extensive amount of time, I spent on the Internet, I was 'in the loop'. Some of my online friends advised me to buy some BTC, in which I did. I ended buying 9BTC which, at the time, they were going for 5/each. I never had used them, and to be honest I forget about them, until the BOOM happened. The moment I saw the price chart reach $700 I immediately looked for the password I had for my wallet. Luckily I was able to remember it and all was great. I as someone who was 15-16 at the time knew nothing of the miracle that, that price hike, was, nor did I know anything about financing and investment. Because of the child that I was I told myself that id let them sit until they reached $1,500+ (They where priced at around $1,000 at this time). This became a mistake as, unexpectedly, when the time passed the price plunged (This was when it was at $1,200) and I lost to opportunity to be a kid with 10K. 


I, after a while did not touch my bitcoin as I thought it would all work its self out. The time passed to months, then a year. Which was when I decided to use my BTC on Gift Cards and unnecessary items. 


The reason for this post is because, Today I am 18 years old and I am seeing the hike in BTC price and want to give this a try, the correct way, and invest 5-8K on BTC. Is BTC going to be stable enough to allow me the time to know whats to come or even sell before it plunges as it did before?

814,"I regularly use tinyurl, and tinyurl itself is not a distributed database, of course its a centralized service.

I saw many ideas of coinurl or whatever Bitcoin-accepting / Bitcoin-earning on shortening-links.

There is no practical usage from seeing ads while visiting your own shortened links, this is just dumb, okay? Because I can go to tinyurl and do it for free without any ads, and I don't care earning anything from shortenings when it consumes someone's time.

Basically what I want is simple: URL shortener with ability for people to make as many entries as possible, **for free**, with no registration. And I don't care if my shortened url will look like Bitcoin-address. I think its time to create uncensorable united blockchain-solution which you can install on any computer connected to the Internet - and this computer will turn into URL-shortening web-server.

What is the purpose? This is backup ability for you to have a permanent, censorship-resistant address on the Internet, without going through complex stuff like paying / mining your own domain (like its done in namecoin). 

Just navigate your browser to any node, make an entry or visit shortened link, since all entries stored on distributed database synchronized between nodes - you don't care if your closest node goes down, because you can navigate to thousands of others where records stored and visit any global links.

And if you have the whole blockchain on your computer, you don't even need an Internet-connection to see where someone's shortened link points to.

Is there anyone interested in collaborating on GitHub for creating such project? I can code php, but would need someone with C++ / bitcoin nodes design experience to bootstrap this opensource project."
815,"I have a spare laptop and spare bandwidth so I decided I would run a full node and help the network.  I am not stupid but not very technical either.  

It took two days to download the full blockchain.  Why is that?  I have a fast 50 MB fiber connection.  50 gigs on bittorrent would take just a few hours.  I had to wrestle with getting ports open and working so all in it took me about three days to get up and running.

So here I am the proud operator of one of only 5,000 full nodes, doing my bit to help bitcoin but the experience is very disappointing.  On my screen I have a large white area that is empty.  It looks like a wallet, because of course it is that as well.  At the bottom of the big empty white space are two tiny icons which if I mouse over one I get a notification that my copy of the blockchain is up to date.  The other one shows how many users are connected to my node.  This is in tiny text that disappears after a 
few seconds.  Other than that, nothing happens that can be seen.

Here's my problem.  There is no reward for running a full node but a definite cost.  We rely on the goodwill of the community to run this essential service without which bitcoin would grind to a halt.  Can't we make this at least a bit more visually interesting.  How about a flashing light every time someone connects to the node, some on-screen statistics regarding how many blocks have been served to other nodes, value of transactions verified, how many other nodes are on-line, what percentage of the processing power I am providing. How about a scrolling bar saying """"Thanks for supporting the bitcoin network"""". What about a simple block explorer allowing you to dig into the details of the blockchain you are so graciously hosting.  If the internet is disconnected, nothing happens so if your network plug falls out you won't even know.  What about a big green light saying online and some indication of the level of traffic passing through the node.

I want to bring my friends up and say look, here's a full bitcoin node making the network run.  I am part of it and you could be too.  However showing a laptop with a blank white screen does not engender much excitement. It does reveal a failure of imagination.

I know, none of this helps the network or is in anyway essential.  It would however make people running full nodes perhaps a little prouder to be doing so and give them something to show off.  To me this points to a fundamental problem with the powers that be in bitcoin.  Yes we are decentralized but we all know now that the core developers wield a lot of influence.  Coders are not blessed with a lot of imagination and tend rightfully to work on making sure everything is technically correct.  Vary few successful companies are run by coders (or accountants for that matter).  Academics are usually terrible business people.  The frilly bits matter and good business people understand that and act accordingly.

I have seen a lot of discussion on how essential full nodes are.  Even the never ending blocksize debate keeps regurgitating the fact that full nodes are dwindling and centralization is a risk.  Very esoteric (and frankly stupid) discussion on increased resource requirements forcing full nodes to close down.  

Come on!  Make it sexy and interesting to run a full node and lots of people will do it. Yes provide an off switch for the frilly bits so serious coders can steer at a blank white screen but give the rest of us a bit of excitement."
816,"Hello, I was just wondering about paying taxes on my mined bitcoin. I know I have to pay Capital Gains, if I was trading it, but what if I was merely mining it? One could argue that digital currency mining is like a lottery or syndicate, and that every time some was mined into my wallet, I won the coin, which is tax free in Canada. How do I file tax for this, its not much, about $200 worth, but is not yet in Canadian Funds."

Basically, the country i live in has a [strict currency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Foreign_Commerce), which is currently paralyzed for natural citizens unless one owns a business, leaving me no other choice but to use the black market exchange. So i decided that i might as well use the bitcoin market since it's technically in a """"grey"""" area of the law (they can be classified as """"goods"""" rather than currency).

What i want to do? get bitcoins (already have some in surbitcoin so done), buy a credit card with them and use it in aliexpress.

I'd like to buy some USB 3G dongles in aliexpress and sell them here. That way i can start a business and obtain Dollars using the Gov. Exchange.

I've read up on services, and found Neteller and Advcash. The first disabled the ability to load the card using bitcoins and the second says that it isn't available in my country (and i'm not sure if its good enough to use a proxy). So I'm out of options.

To compliment this service i've decided to build a website which will act as a free advertising platform for local businesses, musicians, artists and charities that accept bitcoin.

I will make it clear that i am not selling bitcoin, offering investment advice, and that i cannot be held responsible for anyones loss of funds due to human error (by asking them to sign a disclaimer to that effect). I'll also make it clear that i don't work for Coinkite, Mycelium, Blocktrail, Bitpay et al they are just the services i am most comfortable using and happy demonstrating. 

There will inevitably be many questions from people and i imagine i will be allaying a lot of fears e.g. 'Is bitcoin legal? Am i supporting terrorism?' I'm aware of how the general public perceive Bitcoin and how much misinformation there is so i hope to to show off it's strengths. Anyway! this post is twice the length i intended it to be. If you have any good advice, have a bitcoin related product or service that i might not be aware of please let me know.

823,"From the Scaling Bitcoin conference details are emerging of an agreement between large holders and the major mining pools.

Holders that represent up to 20% of sellable coins have agreed not to sell at any price below $400.

Miners representing up to 70% of hashrate have also agreed not to sell below $400.

This is the primary reason why the price has been 'range bound' the last few weeks. 

Those in the know will be discussing details after Christmas regarding this new development.

Miners will come in selling anywhere between 450-500."

I have downloaded mycelium and it shows my address (a jumble of letters and numbers) to recieve bitcoin, but how would my private key be stolen from this app?

I don't really understand how bitcoins can be stolen, unless someone sends the bitcoin from my phone to another address?

2) How safe are the bitcoin ATMs, are they able to be used for scamming/theft?

3) It doesn't matter if my phone is online or not, the bitcoins will be on the blockchaion, so the next time I am online my wallet will update with the amount in there?

4) How are private kets kept safe if you need it to make a transaction, which has to be done online?

5) Is it not possible for app that initially makes the private key be record and steal information?

For bitcoin payments however, it seems like transaction IDs should be mentioned. There is no way I can associate an address to someone. If I claim to have spent 0.1 BTC on a purchase, how do I prove that the transfer of bitcoins as visible on the blockchain was actually to the recipient? Heck, most businesses that use Coinbase et. al use new addresses for each transaction.

I can show a transaction of 0.1 BTC from me to some other person for a tablet I bought online as the transaction for a phone I buy online. Isn't it ambiguous that there is no public table of whose address is whose?

837,"TL;DR--Have the network render some small percentage of presumably """"lost"""" coins unspendable each year and """"reissue"""" them as """"bonus"""" mining rewards.  This would help ensure that coins are never permanently lost, that mining rewards are higher than otherwise and continue indefinitely, and that the market has more information about the true bitcoin money supply.

--------

One concern that many have expressed about #Bitcoin is the issue of """"lost"""" coins--coins for which the private key has been lost.  Currently it's impossible to know how many bitcoins actually exist in circulation since the private keys to an unknown number have been lost.   For instance, does Satoshi really still have a million bitcoin hoard, or did he destroy or lose his key?

The potential of lost keys introduce uncertainties and inefficiencies into the system, especially into the price discovery system.   

On a different but related note, others have expressed concern over decreased mining rewards and its potential impact on securing the network or development of a fee market.  

Couldn't we partially solve both of these concerns with a """"simple"""" change to the Bitcoin code that would work something like as follows?

The Bitcoin network would actively monitor the frequency with which coins are """"spent"""" from each address.   For any address from which coins have not been spent in over say...ten years...the network would begin to completely disregard some set percentage of those coins each year, maybe 1 percent or so, making the disregarded coins """"persona non grata"""" on the network.  While such coins would still technically exist, in the since of being accounted for on the network, they would be permanently ignored by all nodes and miners and rendered unspendable.  

Since we would then know with certainty that such coins were rendered permanently unspendable, the network could """"replace"""" the now disregarded coins, via additional or """"bonus"""" mining rewards, without fear of exceeding the hard cap of 21 million bitcoins actually in circulation.  

For instance, let's assume that Satoshi mined all 1 million of his coins in 2009 and hasn't spent any since.  Then, under my proposal above 1 percent of his coins (or ten thousand per year) would be rendered permanently unspendable starting in 2019 (after ten years), and eligible be """"reissued"""" as mining reward, unless and until he spent at least some nominal amount of these coins to another address. If Satoshi's private key is truly lost, then those coins would effectively be returned to the system over a hundred year period via mi ING rewards.   

However, if the key is not lost, then whoever controls it would either make sure to spend the coins from one address to another at least every ten years, or else would almost certainly begin to do so after losing one percent of their coins for a year or two and recognizing the problem.  Any remaining coins in the address that had not been already flagged and disregarded by the network could be freely spent by the private key holder at any time, and spending even a small fraction of them to a new address would reset the 10 year clock.  

I suppose a completely clueless person might never notice that they were losing 1 percent per year, and therefore lose all their coins over a hundred year period, but the wallets could be designed to alert them to this fact and, if they ignore or never get those alerts, because they simply never check their wallet or whatever, then the loss is simply on them.  In percentage terms, the loss would be quite small, and in purchasing power terms might not even be a loss at all (since the loss of a small percentage of coins could be more than offset by increased purchasing power of those that remain spendable). 

This approach would help ensure that coins are never permanently lost, that mining rewards are higher than otherwise and continue indefinitely, and that the market has more information about the true bitcoin money supply. 

Potential problems with this idea:

1). May be technically unfeasible. 
2). May limit Bitcoins usefulness as a means of storing and transferring non-monetary assets or for other non-monetary uses (though I expect there are fairly easy workarounds for this). 
3). Others?

EDIT:  The presumption that lost keys benefit all holders by making the surviving coins more valuable isn't exactly true. The reason is that the market can currently never really know whether keys are lost or not.  

Were I to ever lose my key, I'd much prefer my coins to be reissued as additional mining reward over time than to have all or even a portion of that value to disappear from the Bitcoin economy forever.  "

840,"For a long time I avoided moving away from blockchain.info. 

Why? Because I don't want a HD wallet. I see no real advantage because multiple addresses that confuse me but 'protect my privacy' is not really an advantage for me.

I tried Mycellium.

2 problems.

1. No web interface
2. The seed doesn't seem safe at all. Why can't I have a password too?

I liked the old BIP0038. Private key and password.

Someone said to export the Mycellium seed, clear all data on Mycellium and then import backup but select the 'I have a passphrase' and just pick a passphrase as a completely new wallet will emerge. The old wallet will still exist as a decoy.

This seemed like... a good idea. And it seems to work.

I wonder what are the compatibility implications for this as opposed to getting my coins out through another wallet.

I'm actually also wondering what the Mycellium team thinks about this."

842,"The most important aspect of Bitcoin is decentralization and resilience in the face of government/corporate regulation, DDOS, and other attack vectors.  

There is so much being worked on in Bitcoin Core.  People who are still complaining about a blocksize increase in Bitcoin Core **need to get over it**.  

I originally supported BIP101, but then I changed my mind because I think **it's more important that we come together on the issues we can agree on**.

Everyone knows that increasing max_block_size will increase TPS.  That's not the priority right now of Bitcoin Core devs.  The priority is improving and scaling Bitcoin in a way that will not open Bitcoin up to government or corporate attacks.

Andreas Antonopolous recently said that Segregated Witness marks a turning point for Bitcoin.  I completely agree with him and I am far more interested in seeing SegWit implemented than a blocksize increase.

843,"Coinbase alone claims 3 million users: http://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ye8zv

Even if only 1/3rd of them hold a balance, that means if suddenly half of the block space was to be consumed by Coinbase withdrawals, it would still take several days for all 1 million user's withdrawal requests to be processed (due to block size restriction).

Then add all the block space demand for withdrawals from each exchange (e.g., BitStamp, BitFinex, OKCoin, Huobi, BTC China, BTC-E, Kraken, ITBit, etc.) and custodial wallet (e.g., Coinapult, Circle, Coinbase, Xapo, etc.) and you have a traffic jam miles and miles long.

What withdrawals, you might ask?

The withdrawals from users when they realize that their coins are held in an exchange or wallet service that won't be sharing the """"failed hard fork dividend"""" with them.   What's the """"failed hard fork dividend""""?   

A successful hard fork is one where essentially all mining on the original chain ceases.  If, after the big blocks hard fork begins, there is mining that continues on the original chain (even if it is just 15% of the pre-fork hashing capacity) then that is the definition of a """"failed hard fork"""".   When this happens, pre-fork bitcoins are spendable on both the original chain as well as being spendable on the hard fork chain.   

The """"failed hard fork dividend"""" then is the ability to realize the purchasing power from spending (independently) on both chains.

So if a BTC (bitcoin / original chain) fetches $100, and a BTX (Bitcoin-XT coin / big blocks chain) fetches $250, those who hold pre-fork bitcoins themselves can take some action (tainting of their coins) allowing them to spend the pre-fork bitcoins on both chains and realize the $350 of their pre-fork bitcoin's purchasing power.     

But if that user had that pre-fork bitcoin with a custodial wallet or exchange, it is likely that a big blocks hard fork would result in those services simply substituting the hard fork coin for the user's bitcoin balance.    If that happens, then the user only gets the purchasing power of that one coin (e.g., $250, using the price guesstimate for a BTX given in the paragraph above).

But that remaining $100 doesn't disappear.    It can be realized by the custodial wallet service.   Those custodial services still have those bitcoins that can be used in transactions on the original chain (presuming they took the action to taint their pre-fork bitcoins such that they can be spent independently from the BTXs/big block fork coins).

Even if these custodial services give a """"two week notice"""" (at the point that the 75% mining threshold on Bitcoin-XT occurs), it just isn't anywhere near enough time for most users to get their withdrawal transactions into the remaining block space before the two weeks is up and the user's withdrawal request is honored with BTXs (big block/hard fork coins).

This isn't some warning about some distant future condition.   The hard fork could happen [Edit: in a few weeks, if starting now 75% of the hashing ends up on BItcoin-XT.]

Are people who use a custodial wallet service aware that they lose this """"failed hard fork dividend""""?"
844,"Hello Bitcoin community.  “Heygodard” and I “medicinebottle” are pre-launching our Korean shopping agent service, “Koreanbuddy.” **[Koreanbuddy.com](http://koreanbuddy.com)**

**Gavin Andreson, Jeff Garzik, and Mike Hearn Are Non-visionary Hacks**

- Gavin Andreson basically laughed while he thought that bitcoin would never reach $40.  Gavin gave away his role as lead bitcoin developer.  Gavin initially gave high praise to the company Blockstream.  Gavin is a nobody except for the fact that he was Satoshi's first assistant.  Gavin worked for SGI which is worthless as a company and eventually went bankrupt.  Gavin is a founding member of the discredited Bitcoin Foundation who paid him a salary.  Gavin leaves the Bitcoin Foundation in shambles with little to no money.  Gavin invents nothing.  Gavin is not a visionary.

- Jeff Garzik is only a Linux developer who has worked in a corporate environment for decades.  He worked for BitPay and then he got laid off.  Jeff foolishly starts a satellite company to relay bitcoin transactions from space (good luck with that).  Jeff invents nothing.  Jeff lacks vision.

- Mike Hearn has worked on failed bitcoin projects such as Lighthouse.  Mike Hearn was never an active developer for Bitcoin Core, only for the Java based bitcoinj.  Mike Hearn now works for R3 which is the ultimate enemy of bitcoin.  Mike Hearn lacks vision.

852,"This week Charles Hoskinson posted a thoughtful post on the Bitcoin Foundation and his idea that an audit would help the organization break from the past.

I'm happy to support an audit provided someone can lead it and do the work involved and/ or support the costs of one.

I do remain skeptical of the value of an audit.  We all know that a lot of money was wasted and lost - I detail the basics of the 2014 spending below -- it is unlikely worse than imagined as all the funds are essentially gone.  I don't think much can be done about past mistakes, the people involved are no longer with the organization.

Also this week, someone on an anti-Bitcoin sub posted this data from the 990 forms and was afraid it would be censored if posted on r/Bitcoin.

I'm happy to post it for them, minus the color commentary and a couple of minor factual inaccuracies.

They also implied that some people would want to not have this information brought to light.  I'm more than glad to.  I don't defend these financial decisions as I had nothing to do with them.  I also had thought the 2014 990 form with this was posted once completed this summer.  At that time we were going through a website and server change and I was also recovering from a car accident, so if it was posted it wasn't in the proper place.  For not having the 990 form posted in the correct section a few months back , that's on me and I'm sorry.   

The bigger matter is the financials themselves.

I don't defend these financials, I certainly don't apologize for them or attempt to justify them.  I had nothing whatsoever to do with these decisions.

As you can see the spending / loss was caused by: 

1) a large drop in Bitcoin value costing millions of dollars - the peak foundation assets were calculated based on a Bitcoin price in the $800 range -- so, had they simply held those coins it would have seen the $6-7 million fall to $2 million or so

2) ridiculously wasteful and reckless spending

3) reasonable and legitimate expenses such as Gavin and dev salaries

I have not been presented any evidence of any theft, criminal act or similar wrongdoing but would be *happy to pay a bounty of at least 10%* for anyone with information and evidence of any such act leading to recovery of any funds which were misappropriated or stolen.  Those who imply that there is any wrongdoing at the foundation now or by those involved now should come forward with evidence or at least a solid and specific accusation.  If presented with any such evidence I would work to have justice done.

It seems strange that so many make an effort to tie those involved now to the sins of the past.

This is the point of a turnaround;  to take what an organization has and make it as useful as possible.   Many people think that the change in management and new focus, combined with a new mission statement can help the organization to help Bitcoin more.

I wish that the foundation hadn't had so many problems.  I did think it was worthwhile to try to help the organization.


Here are the finances:

Salaries

Gavin Andresen: $147k. Chief Scientist. Salary down from $209k (salary was higher in 2013 as it was pegged to BTCUSD)

Jodie Brady: $141k. COO of the Foundation, who also served as CFO at CoinLab (Peter Vessenes' affiliate company). 

Jon Matonis:  $137.5k through """"THE HOLE OF ROY LLC"""". Salary up from $31k. Jon Matonis acted as Executive Director up to October 2014.

Patrick Murck: $115k. Executive Director of the Foundation (as of November 2014). Salary up from $57k. 


Contractors:

""""LOCAL PRODUCER"""" was paid $790k to host Bitcoin 2014 in Amsterdam. 

Apple Fundraising Consultants were also paid $123k for activities related to the aforementioned conference.

THEPOLICYCOUNCILCOM INC as the Foundation's 'Global Policy Counsel', paid $114k for about 9 months of work in 2014. 

And the breakdown of the functional expenses, oh, so many expenses:
Office Expenses: $39k up from $8k in 2013.

Information Technology: $158k up from $67k 

Travel: $159k up from $69k 

Occupancy: $18k up from $7k.

Accounting: $50.5k up from $9.1k. 

Legal fees: $220k up from $161k.


Other: $653k, consisting of: 

Professional services: $307k

Public relations: $93k

Executive Directory Compensation: $137.5k 

Professional event expenses: $115k

Other salaries and wages: $471k up from $72k 


Revenues :
Membership dues: $335k down from $358k
Conference revenue: $584k up from $337k
At the end of 2014 not much was left: $366k. 


2015

The beginning of 2015 still had many expenses similar to the above.  At the time I came aboard those costs reduced dramatically.  There were still high outstanding legal and accounting bills as well as the bitnodes funding and Bitcoin.org funding and other previous obligations that were paid.

Current spending is in the $8k / mo range 

Current expenses:

Board salaries: $0

Executive Director salary: $0

All reimbursements for travel:  in the range of $3000 - primarily for three speakers airfare and hotel (me, Gavin and Andreas) to DevCore, $600 in pizza for the attendees etc.

Aside from one economy flight to DevCore and the hotel I have personally not been reimbursed for any travel.  I have paid some costs from my own credit card for web hosting etc which were also reimbursed - this is also a small amount, perhaps in the $2000 range

Current salaries include one part time bookkeeper and one almost full time ops director.

I'd love any feedback about what the organization can do to break from the past.  We could close, sure.  I'm not convinced that is what's best for Bitcoin and 8/10 top voted candidates from the last four elections don't think that's what the members want.  What else can an organization do to move forward?

I have [released the source code](https://github.com/kamronk/AtHomeWallet) of the project, and have [written a blog post](http://kamronk.com/bitcoin-wallet/) with deployment instructions included.

I'm bringing it to everyones attention so that if there is something I can do to make this more useful, it will be pointed out to me. With the recent popularity of the 21.co device, I thought this may be of use to a number of folks as well.

It can work for any cryptocurrency that utilizes the [standard JSON-RPC interface and functions](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list) found in the original bitcoin source. The list of cryptocurrencies that don't support this interface, is much shorter than the list of them that do. So, it can work with **almost** any altcoin, as well as bitcoin.

The web app is designed to be ran from a micro-PC that already has the cryptocurrency wallet daemon installed and running. It is also meant to **only** be used on trusted networks, such as at home or at a private office. The UI and the backend are all password protected, but you are still better off safe than sorry.

There are also some screenshots of the UI [here](http://imgur.com/JCXWqSE,1jBOmj8,vfm1Smo,MY2FYpB,VvmDq0x#0)

Enjoy :) Let me know if you :

* have any questions
* have any recommendations
* notice any issues with the code"
857,"Some /r/bitcoin posts drew the analogy between """"bitcoin goes big"""" and """"linux on the desktop"""". 

There are many smart people here, what do you guys think of it?

It was speculated in the early 2000s that Linux would """"go big"""" and replace Windows as a desktop/laptop OS. Linux is big today, for a usecase that wasn't widely understood at the time: powering mobiles and the cloud.

If today's understanding of """"bitcoin goes big"""" is buying a coffee with your bitcoin wallet, and this doesn't happen just like Linux never replaced Windows as a mainstream computer OS, what are the new usecases that aren't widely understood yet?"

People say 75% majority is too small to force a change like a block increase.

So why don't we simply make 2 different code bases with the same code, one that has a roadmap that it will increase block-size, and one that says it won't. but without an actual implementation of the block-size increase. Just the block marking.

This way miners can pick which roadmap they like and install the software from that codebase.

This way bitcoin core will be able to find out which percentage of the hashing power wants the block increase and which percentage does not want it. 

It can then decide based on that outcome of the hash-power vote"

884,"Some thinking together. 

The argument the halvening will bring great value to bitcoin's price is for some based on valid logic I think for others a misunderstanding of economics.  In other words I think it is somewhat true this halvening will raise bitcoins price, I believe the theory and """"belief"""" by knowledgeable players is that the value of bitcoin in relation to its monetary supply is such that it's """"price"""" SHOULD rise gradually over time.

That is to say since the markets are well aware of the inflation schedule for all time they are able to immediately adjust to it and so there should not be such an immediate change on the day of halvening. Players in the great game should be able to speculate the increased pressure on the bitcoin's price and so speculators will begin to buy bitcoin slightly before this event.  And so of course some smaller savvy part of the population is expected to invest earlier and so on until present time.

However, in its infancy I think that bitcoin is susceptible to what people will often refer to as types of speculation attacks.  In this regard we would be looking at an attack on its price stability (even though stability includes a gradual upward trend).  When bitcoin is mature we should expect it to be free from manipulation and hype in this regard.  So in the beginning halvenings might likely have a greater effect than the later halvenings in its monetary supply's life cycle.

This is important in relation to our global financial system as the real price discovery of bitcoin occurs.  Again there is optimized theoretical conjectures in regard to optimally decentralized mining pools, fairness and equality in the cost of production, perhaps fungibilty, and other contributing factors that might change or not be ideal for consideration and study in bitcoin's infancy. 

My basic point is that what we are seeing today is a very interesting phenomenon with respect to our national money systems.
 
As bitcoin's value in relation to its cost of production is discovered, it must be that any national fiats that take a dive vs bitcoin while other fiats hold steady or a reasonable relation to each other and bitcoin, MUST have lost their quality. 

bitcoin cannot reasonably decrease or increase in value for say a Canadian dollar if the Canadian dollar stays on par with the rest of the world currencies while the world currencies simultaneously stay on par with bitcoin.

As the exchange markets for fiats/bitcoin grow we should expect this phenomenon of the markets highlighting the quality of each currency to grow.

For this observation it seems to be that we are in the infancy, not necessarily of the adoption of bitcoin as a world currency, but rather a new gold-like standard in which all of the national fiats are now necessarily measured in relation to.

896,"Can we make the assumption that we all long for truth? That we all might crave it, or move to it, or adore it if we could know exactly which content is “true”? Do we know the direction of infallible logic? Do we know what is false doctrine so we might avoid it?

Can these things be sorted out with reason?

I think perhaps we sometimes make the mistake of believing that science levates an objective truth, and that by being blindly peer reviewed, the minimized bias creates a likelihood of truth that is so unrivaled we call it the ultimate objective.

I am not so sure.

We inherit this belief perhaps from our democracies or some other inherited belief system that the majority must rule (rather than perhaps simply (today) the majority does rule) in regard to what is socially acceptable or deemed “truth” (obviously worse would be if an elite minority ruled).

Its easy to see and say one might not want to argue with “social rule” in regard to say a stop light, or a police officer that wants to pull you over for running it, however I think we should not try to extrapolate a corollary that suggest that social rule is the most objective or “truthful” (or scientifically accurate!).

So here I think I have levated a question, that creates a division which I think might be “socially” useful, “Is there an objective truth?”

Firstly we can note that we have broken from the notion that society is the provider of the objective truth, since it should be quite easy to show that at least in the past, society has been the proponent of very subjective truth (perhaps such as the world is flat etc.).

Science claims to be on the pursuit of this, but again it is subject to the whims of social order regardless of its rigorous method and system.

Yet if we can imagine some possible objective truth, perhaps only what god (that might not exist) would know, we might then see this process as a game in which the ultimate strategy is found based on the ultimate objective truth.

Balance then in some sense could be said to be optimal in this regard, but the search, pursuit, and application of balance would of course be futile without a center point (like targeting a corruptible metric!).
"
897,"Ayn Rand taught our natural rights are such that ‘I am free to pursue my own happiness provided that pursuit does not encroach on the rights of others’. It is difficult to argue such a point intelligently or perhaps rationally and it lays the grounds for that which a governing body may or may not enforce rule over.

The crux of this understanding is that we are all born here, and we have not yet found an undeniable purpose for our existence, if there can ever said to be one. Without such instructions or a foundation for logic and rule of law, there is left the difficultly of finding or optimizing social order.

In other words we are all here, and we must either get along or not, and it cannot be otherwise easily argued that one group should have control of another groups freedoms without good reason.

What is good reason?

Some of the greats successfully argued that SOME law and governance is needed to allow for the greatest possible freedoms for the general or average individual man.

Locke argued that governance then should be founded on the principle of least authority. Essentially the only valid governance is governance that NECESSARILY encroaches on the peoples rights, to ensure a greater freedom.

Now, what laws are necessary? This is the great dialogue. It is the crux of how modern society was formed and evolved.

The great evolution progress in relation to technology. That is to say the advent of a technology may render the security or purpose provided by a certain law unnecessary, then society must or should adjust accordingly."

904,"First, I want to point out that I'm not trying to argue from authority in this post. In fact, I want to try to explore the reasons *why* Satoshi did what he did when it comes to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.

Before you read any of my post please read this entire thread. It's only 11 comments, so it shouldn't take too long. I'll wait: 

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=994.0 (THREAD #1)

OK one more thread:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1314.0 (THREAD #2)

Last one, I promise (don't read the whole thread, just first 2 or 3 pages):

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347 (THREAD #3)

Ok these are in chronological order (September 7, 2010; September 29th, 2010; October 3rd, 2010).

When did Satoshi lower the effective blocksize limit from 32 MB to 1 MB by introducing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE limit? July 15th, 2010 - 2 months prior to those threads.

http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/103/


Please note, the commit log only lists this: """"disable minimize to tray on Linux because it has too many problems including a CPU peg bug""""

Hidden in this commit is something that has caused so much pain and misery, yet it was introduced with no fanfare whatsoever. Why? Theymos explains in prior /r/bitcoin thread I found while researching this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3giend/citation_needed_satoshis_reason_for_blocksize/ctygzmi
&gt; Satoshi never used IRC, and he rarely explained his motivations for anything. In this case, he kept the change secret and **told people who discovered it to keep it quiet until it was over** with so that controversy or attackers wouldn't cause havok with the ongoing rule change.

Why would someone that was developing open source software be so clandestine? There's only a few reasons that makes sense: Sabotage (unlikely as this was Satoshi's own project) or security^1 (very likely). There's been a few other times (that I know of) where devs have kept things quiet until after a fix was published. One example: BIP66 fixed a problem that could have caused a hardfork if deliberately triggered. Sipa did not disclose this bug to the public until after BIP66 enforcement was in place. So why was it so important that Satoshi get this into the code without there being a public debate on it? I would posit for very similar reasons.

I'm going to hold off speculating too much what was in Satoshi's head at the time of this commit. I do think linking to his profile at that time helps give context though: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3;sa=showPosts;start=340

&gt; The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain.  In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks.  **It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself.

&gt; The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node. 

&gt; I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less.  It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in.  The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.

&gt; At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.


This particular comment was July 14th, 2010 (a day before the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE commit). Interestingly, he also discussed the runaway CPU fix in the next comment (July 16th, 2010). 

&gt; OK, the undocumented switch """"-minimizetotray"""" which re-enables the option.

&gt; I uploaded the change to SVN.

To further complicate things, the """"slashdotting"""" (analogous to the reddit hug-of-death) occurred on July 11th, 2010.

To summarize:

* Slashdotting July 11th, 2010
* Comment about """"never be more than 100k nodes, probably less"""" = July 14th, 2010
* Forging of the one ring... I mean MAX_BLOCK_SIZE commit = July 15th, 2010
* Jgarzik's 1st thread = Sept 7th, 2010
* Jgarzik's 2nd thread = Sept 29th, 2010
* Jgarzik's 3rd thread (tries to destroy ring with his axe... I mean remove MAX_BLOCK_SIZE from the code) = October 3rd, 2010

**The journey through Mordor... or how to destroy the one ring**

I'll hoping to make another post in a few days that will be a little more... expository and speculative.

**^1** I'd like to make an aside here. To me, transaction spam is a DOS attack on the Bitcoin network even if unsuccessful or unintentional (much like the reddit hug of death). Satoshi spent a lot of time (especially after the slashdotting) trying to plug DOS vectors. In fact, his last public comment was talking about how many DOS vectors still existed. Funny thing is, we aren't finished... SigOps exhaustion and the quadratic verification times for high input transactions still exists. I'm sure there are many more.

Edit: Thanks for gold and the tips."
905,"This was my first ever use of Bitcoin.  The experience was great.  I sent 20$ worth of Bitcoin, it was instantly available to be picked up at a local business and the money was automatically converted to pesos.  Just want to share that Rebit works as smooth as could be!  "
906,"UPDATE site is DOWN:
Just got an email from LoanBase saying they were hacked. Here is a paste of he email:

Loanbase Security Breach

We've discovered that there was a security breach, which resulted in the loss of roughly around 8 BTC. At this stage this is an estimate based on the confirmed breach of 4 user accounts. The maximum amount which may have been lost does not exceed 20 BTC. We detected that the unauthorized access of the user accounts occurred early in the morning on February 6th and continued throughout the day. For more information, please see below.

Here is what we know about the hack at this stage:

4 accounts were confirmed to be compromised.
The accounts compromised did not have two-factor authentication enabled.
The hackers did not gain access to the Bitcoin wallets.
The breach occurred via a security hole in the WordPress blog (we will provide more details later).
The hackers did gain access to our SQL database, this means that sensitive user information may have been leaked, such as: e-mail addresses, phone numbers, names, etc.
Will the funds be reimbursed to those that had an unauthorized withdrawal?
Yes, we will return all the funds of the users who have had an unauthorized withdrawal.

What's next?
We're going to take the following steps:
We've taken down the website for a security update.
All of the passwords have been reset.
Any withdrawals which were approved, but not processed yet, will all be rejected.
We're going to implement additional security procedures, which will help with an earlier detection of such breaches.
Once we bring the website up, we will request that our users change their passwords and update their TFA.
When will the website be up?
Our team is working overtime, so we hope that it shouldn't take us more than 24 hours. We'll keep everybody posted via e-mail, Twitter and Facebook."
907,"I only used BitGo a couple of times a while ago. There was no need at that time for a second password when sending BTC, but they added this in the meanwhile so when I tried withdrawing my 0.1 BTC, the site requested a password that I've never had and which does not match my current account password. Also at the time of deposit there was no warning """"Please check you still have the key of your account"""" or something that should make me aware of the extra added security. After contacting support, they agreed that there's nothing I can do anymore and I should assume the money is gone.
Fortunately I lost only 0.1 BTC but it's enough to put me away from BitGo services.

They probably are a secure service but not for everyday users.
Be careful!"
908,"So let me start off by saying ive never used bitcoin before so this is a beginner experience.

Facts are, i need .5 BTC so i download bitcoin core since some website said its the best, i get an address for .5 btc boom done.  I then realised this synchronizing shit and im like wtf?  So i say fuck that and download eternum and drop another addy and send it to my friend.  Well my friend sent the bitcoin core addy to the bitcoin seller and he transferred the coin to the unsynchd wallet.  

What can I do?  Am I fucked?"
909,"Parabolic movements in any asset prices -regardless of its merits- are usually followed by a sharp correction. Right now we are seeing such a movement in one of the altcoins, and normally this wouldn't concern me. What is concerning though is that right now this parabolic movement is associated with a controversy in our community. These exponential events can turn things around in a  very short time leaving the decision makers clueless to what just hit them (plenty of examples in the history). As someone who has studied human psychology for a bulk of his life, I urge everyone in the community to recognize this very real and powerful phenomena and to urgently come up with a decision that soothes the market temporarily. Much sooner than you think, you may have everyone left, and finding yourself arguing amongst yourselves.             

ps. don't interpret this post as a sign that altcoins are going to the moon. Rather, pegged value to bitcoin means if bitcoin goes down everything goes down (in value, not in adoption), and as a community of believers in decentralized money, we'll all be likely set back for a long time. "

Sure people trust gold, but in order to do much with it you need trusted intermediaries. If we have to rely on gold, but we don't trust the system, then most of the complexity in the world will disappear, along with most of the people.

Bitcoin is a product of the last financial crisis. Satoshi realized that without something like Bitcoin, the inevitable worldwide financial crisis would create a new dark age.

Gold will thrive along with Bitcoin because people understand gold, and Bitcoin will allow the trusted value in gold to be put to work. As this plays out, gold will become less important and the value entrusted to gold will be transferred to Bitcoin. 

In the past, the value entrusted to gold was transferred to government bonds, fiat currencies and financial instruments, produced and controlled by inherently un-trustworthy intermediaries. 

This time we have Bitcoin.

I found Bitcoin-Ex listed as a PayPal-friendly merchant for folks in the US on this wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_To_Buy_Bitcoins_With_Your_Credit_Card

Went through the process of purchasing $100 worth of btc, paid with PayPal, and within an hour the merchant accepted payment. Order confirmation e-mail states that the order would be processed within 48 hours after payment confirmed. Well, over a week later, I continuously checked my order - every time the status was """"Waiting for payment."""" I used the contact link on the order page to inquire about the holdup. Three days, no response. Finally I went back to my order and cancelled it, and sent another e-mail asking for refund. 

A few days later, still nothing. No response, no refund, no bitcoins. I say """"screw it I'll dispute the transaction with PayPal"""". Well, I can't! They sneakily set their """"Pay with PayPal"""" option on the order page to automatically use """"Friends and Family"""", so the transaction can't be disputed. 

I'm not 100% sure this is the right place to post or whatever, but I figured this needed to be said. I searched up and down for reviews on this particular merchant and found approximately squat. Hoping maybe this will allow other bitcoin noobs to avoid this issue. Also, that wiki needs to be updated and Bitcoin-Ex placed in the scam section.

[http://www.bitmex.com](https://www.bitmex.com/register/byORFD)

*(Opens tomorrow)*

Arbitrageurs and market makers are necessary in order to create a liquid market. Bitcoin futures contracts are relatively easy to market make and arbitrage because the underlying is Bitcoin and anyone with an internet connection can trade Bitcoin. Market making or arbitraging futures contracts with China stocks as the underlying is more difficult.

A few years back, the Singapore Exchange launched a USD quanto futures contract on the FTSE CHINA A50 Index. I was trading the SGX A50 futures contract when it first listed. Recently, the SGX A50 futures contract has become a flow monster and is the only liquid way for investors outside of China to go long or short the China A share market with leverage.

To jump start liquidity, BitMEX has copied the contract terms of the SGX product. This allows traders with access to the SGX to easily market make and arbitrage the BitMEX China A50 futures contract."

941,"in reference to [reddit!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/47t2io/how_this_old_timer_secures_his_bitcoin/)

ONZITAM METHOD:

I created  my wallets using the Custom Seed,  Encrypted wallet with coinb.in which I downloaded from github on an offline machine.

Here is the neat part (at least to me)

The seed and password are stored in file like this:

[Pastebin] (http://pastebin.com/TVkjx2sJ.)

The text can be  generated with KeepassX password generator  or any online service. 

All you need to remember:

* 1st short string like """"08D"""" - **""""the mark""""** . 

* 2nd  **the length of the seed / password** for example 88 characters. 

So """"08d"""" appears few times in the text. Locate it by using """"find"""" function in your browser starting form the beginning of the text and use the first appearance to  get 88 letter string that starts right after """"08d"""" as seed.  Then repeat the search  to  locate """"08d"""" second time and use the 88 letter string that is right after """"08d"""" as password to generate  the wallet. 



Variations:
The mark can be the first letters of uour name, or birthday as 8th of Dec, or just anything you never forget. Once u have  a """"mark"""" you can improvise. You can use for example third and firth appearance, different length of password and seed. text left of  the mark or text on right of the mark an so on.

945,"(JFN Ideal Money)
&gt;The label """"Keynesian"""" is convenient, but to be safe we should have a defined meaning for this as a party that can be criticized and contrasted with other parties. 

&gt;So let us define """"Keynesian"""" to be descriptive of a """"school of thought"""" that originated at the time of the devaluations of the pound and the dollar in the early 30's of the 20th century.  The, more specifically, a """"Keynesian"""" would favor the existence of a """"manipulative"""" state establishment of central bank and treasure which would continuously seek to achieve""""economic welfare"""" objectives with comparatively little regard for the long term reputation of the national currency and the associate effects of that on the reputation of the financial enterprises domestic to the state. 

Since the definition above was created before the advent of bitcoin I think it should be updated, since it is quite possible and likely that the Keynesian attitudes that are espoused by so many will pervade the social movement that bitcoin fuels.

How did we arrive to support a system that is so detrimental to its own peoples, when the systems that create them are founded on democracy and by the will of the peoples themselves?  I think it cannot be but from our own ignorance and our attempts to control and persuade things we do not understand.

Blockchain Keynesian:
&gt;A """"blockchain Keynesian"""" would demand an authority of some kind (any kind), manipulate the parameters of bitcoin to serve ones own wants and needs, without proper considerations to the long term ramifications of such authority and manipulation. A """"blockchain Keynesian"""" believes that there can be some group of people that might be able to intuit the future of something that cannot be intuited and thus espouses the belief that arbitrary decisions are not arbitrary.  Specifically put, the blockchain Keynesian wants to manipulate block-size in order to serve a purpose that is detrimental to the society they wish bitcoin to represent.  A block-chain Keynesian wants the block-size to be manipulated."

But the past few times this has happened empirical evidence has shown us that users adapt to these situations and things get back to normal.

I understand that the current problems would not be acceptable in the long run. But while code improvements are still on the roadmap and being developed, why not wait and see how much load the improvements take off the system?

In my own experience, having built a global enterprise software solution, I found that scaling should first of all involve exhausting all possible software/coding related improvements, such as caching, intelligent placement of elements, lazy loading, etc., before buying additional servers and space. Intelligent coding can achieve absolutely phenomenal exponential improvements while adding capacity tends to be rather linear. (Not sure how relevant this experience is to bitcoin, I'm not a core dev or anything like that).

So to me the only reason to add capacity (increase the block size) at this very moment would be if the sky was indeed falling down.

What's the impending disaster scenario and what empirical proof does it rely on?"
949,"Bitcoin currently has a huge transaction backlog, which means transactions with low fees simply don't get confirmed.

If your wallet isn't estimating fees properly, ask the authors to fix it, so this won't happen again."

967,"[Rein](/r/Rein) is a decentralized freelance platform that uses Bitcoin auth, microhosting servers and two kinds of multisig escrow contracts to facilitate programming gigs, graphics jobs, basically anything that can be delivered via email or a link to a download. This evening, marking the culmination of several months of work, the first transaction was completed end-to-end.

The process started after three users enrolled with two Bitcoin addresses, contact and other information. A job was posted via a signed document which was bid on by the second user who submitted a signed document including their payment information, bid amount, and a (rather terse) timeframe for completion.

After the bid was reviewed, the job was awarded with the signing of a Rein Offer and two [funding](http://blockr.io/tx/info/0f79ee1cb1f0d4ae2b40e5d69a8ebcdf63e6cb558f78586cc45d76b179f07f4d) [transactions](http://blockr.io/tx/info/1191586118d42939e276e901597c164c03645f6bd61d7df8d29b8b3ede1e36a9). The work had been in process for the past few days and was delivered and accepted about an hour ago. When the delivery was accepted, payments to the worker (mickmarona) and the mediator (bitspill) were signed and placed in the final signed document of the transaction.

From there, it was up to the worker and mediator to countersign their payments and broadcast to the Bitcoin network. Both payments were confirmed a short time after broadcast effectively completing the transaction.

**tl;dr** New trustless decentralized freelance platform [Rein](http://reinproject.org) completes first transaction. 

If you'd like to try out the platform, here's the [client howto](https://github.com/ReinProject/python-rein/blob/master/doc/HOWTO-setup-rein.md).

968,"Yes I know what is going on with the new #1 alt coin. But I also know that unlike Bitcoin, it has never really been tested and it is very complicated. The rush to this coin is actually a form of temporary insanity.

Yes I know that many people are upset that the block size for the Bitcoin blockchain has not been increased. But despite all the crap thrown at it, Bitcoin is still functioning very well and the transaction rate is adequate for right now. For those who want to abandon ship, you will find that large transaction loads may cause BIG problems for the above mentioned alt coin.

Yes I know that things are moving slowly on the Bitcoin code, but I'm not sure that that is a bad thing at this point in Bitcoin's life-cycle.

As a Bitcoin holder I am feeling the immense FUD. As a trader, this is the feeling that I know I have to fight in order to buy when everyone else is in a panic. I'm looking forward to the chaos which will erupt when those rushing in to the #1 alt recover from their temporary insanity.

I am looking for a device, Something Pi or Arduino based, all i want it to do is display the balance of an address i set on the LCD screen, Something like a desktop clock but just displaying a BTC balance. Does anybody know of any such item already or is it something that I am going to have to have made and programmed? I am not a coder myself nor have i ever messed with a Pi or Arduino so I need a near turn key solution. "
972,"I see there are lot of people here claiming the Core devs are paid by Blockstream and that Core = Blockstream and similiar accusations. I would like to say first, that i am not fan of Core or r/Bitcoin or Classic /r/btc...I am still not decided which team of developers i would choose if i had to...


However, i found out that the claim Blockstream = Core is quite false and there is a lot of FUD flying around... As you can see easily on the Blockstream website, there is a list of members working for Blockstream:


https://www.blockstream.com/team/

To the comparing i used credits/ list of contributors, who contributed to the latest Bitcoin Core 0.12.0. release.

You can find it here:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.12.0.md#credits

The true is that some of the Core developers really ARE working for Blockstream. On both lists i have found:
Matt Corallo Mark Friedenbach Gregory Maxwell Gregory Sanders Patrick Strateman Jorge Timón Pieter Wuille

7 coders are on both lists...

I counted that to the 0.12.0 Bitcoin Core release contributed 94 coders...

So 7 coders out of 94 coders are employees of Blockstream...

I think also important fact is, that to the 0.12.0 Bitcoin Core release contributed also Gavin Andresen, who i see personally as most trustworthy person in bitcoin development.


So when people say Core = Blockstream, you are forgetting the rest -&gt; 87 coders...You are forgetting that there are 87 coders out there who are working on code to make your/our bitcoin network better and safer and who must take all the negatives and critisicm from community. It is really thankless job and i kind of feel for them.

Once again, please check the list of all contributors to Bitcoin Core releases before you get your opinion that all Core devs are working for Blockstream, because it is simply not true...
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.12.0.md#credits

I am not saying you should choose Core over Classic or Classic over Core...I just wanted to share this, because i don't think proper """"research"""" on this FUD/claim was done yet."
973,"It looks like most of the major wallet services like Coinbase require government-regulated verification of government-issued identification. We can't declare our own identities and find private ways of verifying, according to these services. It makes me extremely uncomfortable because the most valuable part of BTC is its security - in being anonymous and independent from government. 

Coinbase solves one anonymity issue by changing your BTC address every few months or every transaction. And they never reveal this info to others. But I also found the site bitlaunder.com, which completely disconnects your identity. 

The only issue beyond that is the fact that the place where my precious BTC is stored is tied to my government-issued identity, which makes it all too easy for the government to plug in and extort money or steal it. 

Do we have alternatives? This makes me really angry that the first popular and fundamental services would do something so dangerous and irresponsible for their community."
974,"Is there anyone working on either a decentralized deep learning algorithm, or a consumer facing app that uses AI to help people diagnose themselves?

My wife was just diagnosed with CVID a couple of weeks ago, it's like AIDS except it's not Aquired, it's part genetic and part environmental - but it's a rare primary immunodeficiency disease.

She's had this her entire life. She's 33 years old, a wonderful mother to our 5 year old daughter, and beautiful singer, actor and writer. She was misdiagnosed 3 or 4 times, most recently she was eating gluten free for the last 8 years because she was diagnosed as celiac disease.

She's lost most of her hair over the last 6 months and has been in the hospital 3-4 times this year. It turns out, she never had celiac, she has always had CVID.

**Where Deep Learning fits in.**
My wife should have been diagnosed in her childhood years, in fact, all it would have taken was a simple blood test to measure her antibody levels, and an Immunologist appointment.

With all of her symptoms, her medications and blood test results - a deep learning algorithm would have been able to suggest a proper diagnosis in a few minutes instead of the 30 years that it took for her to get properly diagnosed by just letting doctors do their thing.


**The problem with diagnosing rare diseases:** 
CVID affects 1 in 25,000 - 50,000 people, it's a rare disease where patients present with a myriad of symptoms and autoimmune problems. It's hard to get a correct diagnosis because a patient typically sees many different doctors to treat the different types of symptoms, and they don’t typically share information efficiently - nor do they have an incentive to properly diagnose her.

There should be a visually appealing, easily marketable app that combines machine learning and crowdsourced input from app users to give the """"hot/cold"""" direction that will greatly improve time to diagnose these """"zebra"""" cases.

The average lag time for CVID diagnosis is 6-7 years. This is common with most rare diseases. If my wife was diagnosed even 2 years ago, she would not have lost all of her hair.

The treatment for my wife’s condition is IVIG every 2-4 weeks, and it greatly improves quality of life and life expectancy. The earlier a rare disease is diagnosed, the better the quality of life.

**The problem with doctor-facing AI solutions:**
I see that there are some machine learning startups, but they are mostly targeted towards health professionals. There’s resistance from doctors to adopt AI. 

The problem is that this technology needs to be available for the patient, not just doctors, and not just specialists at John Hopkins or the Mayo Clinic.

Nobody is going to be as motivated and investing in someone's health as the person and their loved ones. Quite often, patients with diseases become more knowledgeable than the specialists treating them for the disease.

There’s a lot of knowledge to be tapped into there from the 'zebras' themselves.

**Potential barriers to a centralized organization providing this solution:**
The FDA and drug companies are resistant to technologies that allow users to diagnose themselves. 23andme ran into issues with this. They just finally got FDA approval in October to start helping people agian (http://www.popsci.com/23andme-gets-fda-approval-for-direct-to-consumer-genetic-tests)


**Some existing projects:**
A friend who sold his company to Salesforce for 70 million dollars introduced me to this TED talk shortly after my wife was diagnosed, where Jeremy Howard explains how deep learning works, and it’s potential applications:
https://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn?language=en

^Jeremy's company Enlitic is using deep learning to help doctors come to a proper diagnosis faster, currently only focusing on radiology. Again, it's just doctor-facing.

www.findzebra.com is a search engine that you can input your symptoms, it uses something similar to deep learning to suggest possible health issues, but it doesn’t use AI. It crawls and indexes only curated medical sources.

Jeremy Gardner &amp; the Augur guys introduced me to www.crowdmed.com which is a great solution for diagnosing rare diseases, but costly.

CrowdMed is a site where you tell your story, and then it uses crowdsourced knowledge to come to diagnosis suggestions. You pay a monthly fee of $299 - $749 a month, and then “medical detectives” investigate for you, and their predictive market algorithm ranks what the detectives submit.

Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum told me about www.numer.ai which is a competition that uses homomorphically encrypted machine learning to let people try to predict the stock market. It’s a way to anonymize data, to alleviate some concerns about people’s medical data being publicly available.

Xprize even has a $5 million dollar prize up with IBM Watson for AI http://www.xprize.org/ai

There's also openai.com, with names like Elon Musk &amp; Sam Altman attached, it's a non-for-profit with a billion dollars committed, but they haven't yet released what their focus is.

**Potential solution to being blocked by FDA etc:**
Decentralized deep learning on a blockchain, where users are rewarded tokens for providing the hot/cold and running the network. Think ethereum, bitcoin, etc.

In my limited understanding of machine learning, it seems that for a deep learning algorithm to learn, humans need to give it hot/cold inputs to the correlations it comes up with as it compares datasets (Jeremy’s ted talk video explains that)

My theory is that a decentralized deep learning algorithm on a blockchain could be built where the people giving hot/cold inputs are awarded with a token for doing the mechanical turk style work. When consensus is achieved, the people who were correct get rewarded. Similar to how Augur’s reporting system works, or bitcoin’s proof of work.

If users are rewarded for giving correct hot/cold inputs to help the deep learning AI learn about subjects, there’s a financial incentive to keep the network running.

Companies, individuals, universities, etc could tap into the algorithm to use it for whatever purpose they want - and they would pay to use it.

IE I want to build an application that uses deep learning to help diagnose rare diseases so people like my wife don’t have to suffer going undiagnosed and untreated their entire lives. I would pay to have the algorithm learn about the human body, how it works, diseases, treatments, etc. The users of the network get paid to """"train it” with hot/cold inputs.

Is there anyone working on anything like this, whether it’s centralized or decentralized?"

977,"Personally I think payment will be integrated in every sort of structure where I can currently send someone a text message, so in every form of messenger. 
Global payments from a fraction of a penny to millions of dollars will be transferred instantly and for free.
Most online businesses with subscription fee models will become pay with 2 clicks for what you want to get. Most ads on the internet could also probably be replaced with small Bitcoin payments. 
Mining chips will be in every device, making money a computer system resource. Through this, machine to machine payments will introduce to world to an economy where a network of servers will be able to run simulations by receiving micro payments if someone needs more computer power.
Similar example of this principal (21: ping): https://21.co/learn/ping21-earn-bitcoin-by-monitoring-uptime-and-latency/

With ananomous micropayments the distribution of illegaly copied movies/softwear/music/ etc. without many malware will become profitable. 

Machine to machine payments will allow things like mesh networks, therefore the use of the internet will be possible by simply charging a given device, since we said mining chips will be in every device ;).
Or given wifi spots could sell their bandwidth (think airports/railway stations).

TV ads could also be skipped by paying with Bitcoin.

Since a person simply has to have an internet connection to instal a wallet and receive payments, billions of people in poor countries will have access to financial services all of a sudden. This will unlock the knwoledge of these people into the global economy.
Think this way: Lack of Education/skills are by far not the only reason why some countries are less rich than others. For example bad institutions, lack of infrastructure, opressive regimes, lack of legal protection, corruption etc. Therefore if these people would come to countries with better possibilities to be productive, these people would earn much higher salaries. With Bitcoin these skilled people can sell their productivity (or export) to richer countries.


remittances...

These are some quick thought about the future
Any other ideas?
I would like to concentrate on use cases for Bitcoin the currency, since it's much easier to understand.

&gt; There are other virtual currencies besides bitcoin, however bitcoin's blockchain is the most mature

&gt; – It has a critical mass of followers and capacity, which creates that self-regulating functionality that allows for skipping intermediaries, says Anna Felländer, digitalisation economist at Swedbank.

&gt; You get a machinery of trust without central banks or intermediaries, she adds.

&gt; Felländer is enthusiastic as she describes what can become reality in a few years. The blocks, containing information, can contain so much more than payments. They can contain all sorts of financial assets, injected into the chain.

&gt; – It might be a credit commitment, a power of attorney or a piece of land, she says.
