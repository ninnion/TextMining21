2009,"The next big company in the crypto space, will be the one that makes it easy to get into Fiat when needed, as fast as possible. Unless banks offer this soon, they will be made redundant, which of course is preferred IMO.

People will need, and do need, to get into Fiat to pay bills etc. There really isn't that much info out there at all. I know I shall be needing to change some of my Btc into Fiat this year - for the first time - as I am going to need the money to live on. Hence the post really. I have been trying various ideas out, while looking for crypto friendly banks, but although some of them are mega, the Fiat side not so much.

I want to be able to cash out some Btc, and have it available as Fiat in my bank account. Or better still, a crypto bank that does both. I could just sell a little Btc, the Fiat goes into my account, and I can pay bills etc. I get that coinbase do a visa card, but that leaves a horrible to sort out tax trail in my mind.

Just putting it out there. I have always hoped that I would eventually not need to get out of Btc and pay bills in Btc, but not yet. I won't be cashing out anymore than I need to as obviously compared to the dog that is Fiat, it's a no brainer. Been hodling Since Jan 17"
2010,"Not investment advice.

The people most at risk are late 20s-mid 40s. I'm talking rekt financially in general.

For those 30 and under, they have only experienced working life of everything goes up, good economy, and easy credit. For the older ones, those who avoided getting rekt in the 08 housing meltdown actually benefited. This benefit shows up in the mid 30s to mid 40 year olds who have multiple properties and/or massive homes with significant equity. Many at the time (myself included) did not realize the game they were playing was stacked in their favor.

I think we are halfway through the run. I've never seen a market like this. Retail, institutions, the halving, money printing gone crazy, and supply shocks of commodities and products from covid.

I'm starting to see friends who have tons of cash wake up-they've lost 10-20% of real value. A house that they wanted is now out of reach...my guess in many cities it will be permanently out of reach. The days of 30% of income going to a house are over-you can do that, but you better have some rich parents or equity."

2012,"I wanted to share a story of my relationship with Bitcoin which started in early 2017. A coworker had first introduced this idea of bitcoin to me in our hallway chat and I ultimately have him to thank for being the type of person that could explain this to me really in-depth. Mind you, we are engineers so this type of nerd-tech is very appealing to us, at least more than the average joe. After he explained to me the significance of bitcoin and its potential use case, I was enthralled by its beautiful simplicity and used of computational mathematics to allow people to share money peer to peer. I remember watching YouTube videos and trying my best to understand how transactions were verified and what exactly the value was of this digital code in cyberspace. I'll be honest, it still is quite challenging to fully understand, but I think superficially I can understand its basic operation. Anyway, that conversation sparked an interest in me and I subsequently learned about exchanges and this new idea of a digital wallet. I promptly opened an account on an exchange and bought my first BTC, ETH, and some LTC. I remember watching my wallet like a hawk and even took some profits after what was probably a quick pump. Woohoo, I made $2k on that first position. I thought I was a fucking baller and for reference, BTC was probably around $1k at that time. I then do what all crytpo noobs did an invested those gains into other shitcoins and ICOs. Oh, the ICO craze of 2017. A lot of people learned lessons that year. I think I ended up only slightly in green after that entire fiasco. I had not held BTC all the way to $20k either. I just couldn't allow myself to buy something that parabolic. Then, I watched the market quickly crash and go into its bear cycle. I saw how low the demand was, FUD was at an all-time high, and not one peep about bitcoin in the mainstream media. For the newbies, when you don't hear about bitcoin -- FYI you're in the bear market. I ultimately forgot about BTC and thought all of the HODLers who's posts I read on reddit were fucking crazy. I decided to stay away for the time being because I didn't understand.

Now let's talk about how to lose big with opportunity costs.

Fast forward to the pandemic-induced crash of 2020. I knew the stock market had a nice juicy dip. I had been saving a bunch of money from salary pay and was just patiently waiting for some type of crash to occur, so I promptly opened up a robinhood account with $5k and acquired a variety of discounted stocks. However, I also noticed that bitcoin was hovering a price of $4500 or so. I thought wow, we've come a long way from that $20k rally in 2017. I used the leftover money in the RH account, about $200, and put in in. I thought eh, why not. BTC has been so sideways and now at $4k I figured it wouldn't hurt. I still wasn't a believer. 

Fast forward to end of Feb 2021. BTC rallies to $60k. Even for the past few weeks, it has yet to even dip below $50k. I now have been stacking sats more than ever before in my life. I watch a bunch of YouTube videos, hangout in the clubhouse rooms, listen to podcasts...the whole nine. I kick myself for waiting SO FREAKING LONG to just HODL and believe in this technology. With the money I had in a savings (pftt a fiat savings account, what a fucking joke), had I invested most of that into that delectable price of ~$4k, I would have been a millionaire this year. A fucking millionaire. However, as the great Michael Saylor said, """"You buy bitcoin at the price you deserve it."""" Truer words cannot be spoken. I deserved to buy at $47k. You know what though? I am more convinced in the revolutionary power of bitcoin at $47k than I ever was at $4k. I think that is the most important thing about becoming a bitcoin convert. When you don't believe, you stare at a price of 4 thousand dollars per bitcoin and think, """"meh."""" Most of you who have just started your crypto journey are probably on the fence too. I have a theory that it takes people a whole bull/bear cycle to finally take this seriously. It took me getting into this space in 2017 to understand what it’s like to lose faith, and then to have it restored in the bull run. Yes BTC can go to $20k, $40k,…$100k and beyond? YES. Even when this run comes crashing down, I'm HODLing my precious coins. So, I just wanted to share this story for those of you who might not understand yet. The maxis, the hodlers, the methodical sat stackers ... were all part of the ecosystem built on the hardest currency that has ever existed in our lifetime. 
TL; DR
It took me a whole bitcoin cycle to come to terms with how powerful and meaningful bitcoin is for our generation. I was not convinced in 2017, but now I'm bullish as fuck and HODLing for life. 

I have some quick tips to share, just keep in mind I am in no way a financial advisor or financial expert. I'm just a guy who wants to make life changing monetary decisions for his family.
1)	Take BTC seriously now, don't wait. Chances are you have residual income sitting in a savings account. Unless you have an immediate need for it, invest it in bitcoin. Keep enough fiat to have a safety net in life incase you lose your job or whatever, but always stack sats. 
2)	Try you best to learn from as many different sources as you can. Get different opinions. Talk to people. Read. Find what you believe in and make sure you can explain it to someone clearly. For me, BTC is king.
3)	Set up a reoccurring payment on cash app. This will help you dollar-cost-average your way into bitcoin. They also have an awesome boost on their debit card that rewards you in BTC. 
4)	Hold your own keys. Stop leaving BTC in an exchange. You never know when you’re most vulnerable. Stay safe and don't get rekt.
5)	Tell everyone you know about bitcoin to the point it makes you annoying. Wealthy people who own mass amounts of fiat would like to keep you poor, to hide their secrets to wealth. Bitcoiners want everyone to participate and share knowledge. As the network increases (nodes and hodlers), so does the power of bitcoin. We’re in this together. 
6)	Never underestimate how messy it can be to sell during the blow off top. You might think you’re going to cash out in the high six figure range. I’m here to warn you that everyone else thinks that too. How are you going to sell when Coinbase crashes due to too many users selling at the same time? Either figure out how to efficiently take profits, or adjust your expectations. After all, we all rely on pretty much a handful of exchanges. Expecting them to perform under the most burdensome load is not realistic. 
7)	Be happy. You are staring at the opportunity of a generation. You are not late. If you’re here right now, you’re still early. No matter what, if you just HODL you will come out on top."

2016,"I'm considering using a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger.  Yet, I have a big question.  What happens if I transfer Bitcoin from an exchange to a Trezor, and then the Trezor fails or gets destroyed?  What would happen in that case?  Would it be better to keep Bitcoin on an exchange?  Thanks!"
2017,"I find it very strange that a lot of people keep posting about the person who bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins in 2010.  They then go on to praise Laszlo for using bitcoin as it was intended and """"helping"""" bitcoin adoption and other nonsense.

He did neither of these things by selling Bitcoin for 2 pizzas.  In doing so he signaled to the market that 2 pizzas are worth more than 10,000 bitcoin.  If you believe this helps bitcoin's adoption or economy, I ask that you kindly take your economic ignorance and get the fuck out.  Perhaps you and your shitty Keynesian ideas would be better suited in /r/Economics.

What is almost never mentioned is the person who accepted 10k bitcoin for 2 pizzas.  THAT guy used bitcoin as intended and helped grow the bitcoin economy with his foresight that 10k bitcoin is worth more than 2 pizzas.  He should be praised and honored for without people like him Bitcoin would have never become valuable."
2018," 

When discussing the regulations about defi you may believe it only applies to altcoins. This is deeply wrong and misguided. First of all there are platforms being developed that use unwrapped native bitcoin. Second of all, any of these laws against DeFi in general will absolutely destroy the future of bitcoin as an independent government free tool. It will be fully controlled by KYC, globally, in every single area except private wallet to wallet transactions. anything that so much as looks like Local Bitcoins will be KYC'd with extreme prejudice. You will have no real fundamental freedom from the government. Microsoft is even developing bitcoin layer 2 smart contracts that have built in KYC. 

Chainalysis will be used against you with extreme prejudice, very little bitcoin will truly be fungible, and it will be dangerous to acquire. 

What the bitcoin community tries to convey as a antithesis to altcoins, to me really comes across as an antithesis to layer 2 solutions. 

Bitcoiners do not want to deal with the regulations that will fundamentally dictate layer 2 and lightning network, yet if the western governments get their way, none of these layer 2 functionalities will ever exist without KYC and mass surveillance, ergo you will never see the separation of money and state. 

This is why the definition of non entities, non companies, non custodians as vasp is a mortal threat to liberty and the values of bitcoin. It's why the travel rule is so bad. It prevents any real freedom from this state intrusion. 

You as a community need to realize what layer 2 is, what web 3.0 is, and defend it, because it is the most important cultural battle of our lives."

Yesterday, CME released that they want to start a micro BTC contract for .1 BTC. That is a 50:1 difference in contract amount.

I first became aware of CME group through Silver pricing mechanisms/manipulations. With Silver a CME contract is 5000 ounces and a micro contract is 1000 ounces, 5:1 difference.

2029,"White paper should be called an accurate and comprehensive report. In other words, white paper (white paper) or white paper is a convincing, credible and in-depth document on a specific issue that states a method and solution. Only in the field of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies does the term white paper use a lot as well as ICO.

2030,"Just thinking out loud.  Tell me how dumb all of this sounds.

Current mining:

&amp;#x200B;

*  fee is added to every transaction.
* miners sift through the transactions and poach the most profitable ones (based on fee) to include in the next block.
* this leaves transactions out of blocks when the size of all incoming transactions is greater than the allowed block size for the next block.
* during times of high activity, this causes fees to rise.  Rising fees causes more investment in mining.  BUT, not more throughput into mining is accomplished.
* during times of low activity, the older transactions are cleared.
*  if a transaction becomes old enough without getting mined, it is forgotten entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

The above is based on a single decision, the fixed block size.  But, what if we had variable block sizes that were allowed at certain times?  What if we had classes/grades/tiers of transactions?

For instance, let's play around with the idea:

*  Three tiers of transactions are declared possible.  The first tier equates to the the bell-curve of the middle X% of transactions at any given time based on fee included in the transaction.  These transactions basically behave (are treated like) as they do today.
*  As a transaction is created, the software responsible for building the transaction should set the fee (based on user input), but also classify the transaction (this is new). 
* As a transaction is created, the software responsible for building the transaction should examine the mempool to determine which rates will trigger which classifications for this transaction.  

1.  If a chosen fee on a transaction would result in that transaction being within the bottom 15% of the mempool (based on fee average), then it can be/is to be labeled as a 'bottom tier' transaction before getting added to the mempool.
2. If a chosen fee on a transaction would result in the transaction being minable with in the next half-block (or some %), then it can be/is to be labeled as a 'top tier' transaction before getting added to the mempool.
3. Otherwise, transactions are labeled as 'standard-tier'.

* Top-Tier transactions are given priority over transactions of other tiers.  Full Stop.  As too many people try to create premium tier transactions, they'll end up having to have them labeled as standard-tier.  This means that during times of high demand, you'll know, during transaction creation, whether or not you can expect your funds to transfer during the next block.  You can up your fee accordingly.  It also means that only so many will/can get in.  During times of rapidly changing demand, there can be some top-tier transactions that have lower fees than standard-tier transactions!  This is different from the behavior today.  Today, every block is evaluated based on every transaction's current status regardless of the state of the mempool when the transaction was first created.
* Standard-tier transactions are processed much as they are today.  Premium transactions come first, but premium transactions are limited to a percentage of the block size, so some standard transactions will always be processed in every block.
* Bottom-tier transactions are guaranteed to clear within two weeks (ish).  Every x number of blocks (based on a week), a bottom-tier clearing is enforced on miners.  A single larger block is mined with transactions consisting of premium-tiers + standard-tiers + every bottom-tier transaction that is older than 1 week.  This block can be of any size necessary to clear the queue of older bottom-tier transactions.
* Standard-tier transactions are guaranteed to clear within about a week.  Every x number of blocks (based on a half-week or thereabouts), a standard-tier clearing is enforced on miners.  A single larger block is mined with transactions consisting of premium-tiers + every standard-tier transaction that is older than a half week.  This block can be of any size necessary to clear the queue of older standard-tier transactions.
* Bottom-tier transactions created one day earlier will have to wait until the next week's clearing.  In this manner, you must wait between one and two weeks for a bottom-tier transaction to clear.  But it is guaranteed to clear.

1. Standard-tier transactions created one day earlier will have to wait until the next half-week's clearing.  In this manner, you must wait between a half and a full week for a standard-tier transaction to clear.  But it is guaranteed to clear.

* We end up with a system where people who NEED immediate bitcoin transfers can get them into the next block reliably with a positive understanding of the fee necessary to make that happen.  This is, for the most part, possible today, but it formalizes the process and guarantees that it happens.
* Standard-tier transactions will end up working a lot like they do today.  However, there will be a guarantee that they will clear in a relatively soon amount of time.  This amount of time will be less than bottom-tier transactions.
* In the end, pricing can rise or fall based on demand just like it does today.  Mining profits can rise and fall based on demand just as it does today.  But, most importantly, everyone understands what cost is required to provide a level of service and transactions are guaranteed to clear rather than be dumped from the mempool.

I think this might be a decent compromise?  For instance, every \~10 minutes, people with a need for a nearly instant transaction will have the tools necessary to make that financial decision.  In practice, they are bidding on their right to enter the next block.  If they can wait (and most can, let's be honest), they have two other tiers to play with.  Bottom-tier transactions will probably always sit at 1 sat per v-byte.  But so what?  People who don't care to wait, do that anyway (I did earlier this year).  Within the standard-transaction tier, pricing still matters as higher fees will still result in shorter wait times for getting included in a block.

&amp;#x200B;

Ramifications:

* Someone could try to spam the mempool by including terabytes of transactions.  But they'll have to pay ***something*** to do so, so miners that can successfully pull those blocks off will still reap those rewards.
* This will remove many headwinds against people spending bitcoin on smaller transactions.  There will still be a lower bound (if 1 sat were $10, then you wouldn't buy a $0.35 piece of candy with bitcoin), but micro transactions can be handled by lightning, or some other solution).
* Businesses, in general, won't really care to wait on standard-tier (or even bottom-tier in certain cases) transactions.  There isn't an expectation of immediate payments now, in business, so floating something before payment arrives is acceptable already today.  If a business knows that a standard/bottom tier transaction is \*in\* the mempool and has a idea of when it is guaranteed to clear, then that will open up their ability to use bitcoin for customer transactions.

\----------

So, this is a very amateur pass at a thought experiment around variable block sizes (limited to certain reliable conditions).   The specifics in this post aren't the point.  The number of tiers, percentages used to determine which pier, time to wait, etc. are all fluid.  This is just meant to stir a conversation.  And, for all I know, there are alts that already do this.

This coupled with legislation to remove capital gains taxes on smaller transactions would go a long way toward making bitcoin truly adoptable for most everyday transactions.  It sure would be nice if our law makers could work in concert with bitcoin developers to perhaps formally define which types of transactions ***would*** be susceptible for capital gains.  Imagine capital gains, for instance, only people applied to certain tiers.

“The EVERYTHING Short

My fellow apes,
After writing Citadel Has No Clothes, I couldn't shake one MAJOR issue: why do they have a balance sheet full of financial derivatives instead of physical shares? Even Melvin keeps their derivative exposure to roughly 20%...(whalewisdom.com, Melvin Capital 13F - 2020)
The concept of a hedging instrument is to protect against price fluctuations. Hopefully you get it right and make a good prediction, but to have a portfolio with literally 80% derivatives.... absolute INSANITY.. it's is the complete OPPOSITE of what should happen.. so WHAT is going on?
Let's break this into 4 parts:
 1. Repurchase &amp; Reverse Repurchase agreements
 2. Treasury Bonds
 3. Palafox Trading
 4. Short-seller Endgame

Ok, 4 easy steps... as simple as possible.
Step 1: Repurchase &amp; Reverse Repurchase agreements.
WTF are they?
A Repurchase Agreement is much like a loan. If you have a big juicy banana worth $1,000,000 and need some quick cash, a repo agreement might be right for you. Just take that banana to a pawn shop and pawn it for a few days, borrow some cash, and buy your banana back later (plus a few tendies in interest). This creates a liability for you because you have to buy it back, unless you want to default and lose your big, beautiful banana. Regardless, you either buy it back or lose it. A reverse repo is how the pawn shop would account for this transaction.
Why do they matter?
Repos and reverse repos are the LIFEBLOOD of global financial liquidity. They allow for SUPER FAST conversions from securities to cash. The repo agreement I just described is happening daily with hedge funds and commercial banks. In fact, the submitted amount for repo agreements today (3/29) was $40.354 BILLION. This amount represents the ONE DAY REPO due on 3/30. So yeah, SUPER short term loans- usually a few days. It's probably not a surprise that back in 2008 the go-to choice of collateral for repo agreements was mortgage backed securities..
Lehman Brothers went bankrupt because they fraudulently classified repo agreements as sales. You can do your own research on this, but I'll give you the quick n' dirty:
Lehman would go to a bank and ask for cash. The bank would ask for collateral in return and Lehman would offer mortgage backed securities (MBS). It's great having so many mortgages on your balance sheet, but WTF good does it do if you have to wait 30 YEARS for the cash.... So Lehman gave their collateral to the bank and recorded these loans as sales instead of payables, with no intention of buying them back. This EXTREMELY overstated their revenue. When the market started realizing how sh*tty these """"AAA"""" securities actually were (thanks to Michael BRRRRRRRRy &amp; friends), they were no longer accepted as collateral for repo loans. We all know what happened next.
The interest rate in 2008 on repos started climbing as the cost of borrowing money went through the roof. This happens because the collateral is no longer attractive compared to cash. My favorite bedtime story is how the Fed stepped in and bought all of the mean, toxic assets to save the US economy.. They literally paid Fannie &amp; Freddie over $190 billion in bailouts..

A few years later, MF Global would suffer the same fate when their European repo exposure triggered a massive margin call. Their foreign exposure to repo agreements was nearly 4.5x their total equity.. Both Lehman and MF Global found themselves in a major liquidity conundrum and were forced into bankruptcy. Not to mention the other losses that were incurred by other financial institutions... check this list for bailout totals.
But.... did you know this happened AGAIN in 2019?
https://preview.redd.it/9htr7vn8g9q61.jpg?width=912&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25995c33d0056f6108471baa373d1a371b5d0cd5
Instead of the gradual increase in rates, the damn thing spiked to 10% OVERNIGHT. This little blip almost ruined the whole show. It's a HUGE red flag because it shows how the system MUST remain in tight control: one slip and it's game over.
The reason for the spike was once again due to a lack of liquidity. The federal reserve stated there were two main catalysts (click the link): both of which removed the necessary funds that would have fueled the repo market the following day. Basically, their checking account was empty and their utility bill bounced.
It became apparent that ANOTHER infusion of cash was necessary to prevent the whole damn system from collapsing. The reason being: institutions did NOT have enough excess liquidity on hand. Financial institutions needed a fast replacement for the MBS, and J-POW had just the right thing.. $FED go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
\""""but don't say it's QE..\""""

Step 2: Treasury Bonds
Ever heard of the bond market? Well it's the redheaded step-brother of the STONK market.
The US government sells you a treasury bond for $1,000 and promises to pay you interest depending on how long you hold it. Might be 1%, might be 3%; might be 3 months, might be 10 years. Regardless, the point is that purchasing the US Treasury bond, in conjunction with mortgage backed securities, allowed the fed to keep pumping unlimited liquid tendies into the repo market. Surely, liquidity won't be an issue anymore, right?
Now... take the repo scenario from the Lehman Brothers story, but instead of using ONLY mortgage backed securities, add in the US Treasury bond: primarily the 10-year. Note that MBS are still prevalent at 19.1% of all repo transactions, but the US Treasury bond now represents a whopping 67%.
https://preview.redd.it/t5jkjj5bg9q61.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8add42402770ffcb76f2cfcb56e4f28196a42e96
For now, just know that the US Treasury has replaced the MBS as the dominant source of liquidity in the repo market.

Step 3: Palafox Trading
Ever heard of Palafox Trading? Me either. It's pretty much meant to be that way.
Palafox Trading is a market maker for repurchase agreements. Initially, they appear to be an innocent trading company, but their financial statements revealed a little secret:
https://preview.redd.it/8w7uhymcg9q61.png?width=723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2350bca6b44c8d470904525dc7dfca914cc7f7a
Are you KIDDING ME?... I should have known...
OF COURSE Citadel has their own private repo market..
Who else is in this cesspool?!
https://preview.redd.it/ah5775qdg9q61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad4ab23bdee3739d06f4443e97da4c6172199590
I made this using the financial statement listed above, showing all beneficiaries of the GFIL
Everything rolls into the Citadel Global Fixed Income Master Fund... This controls $123,218,147,399 (THAT'S BILLION) in assets under management... I know offshore accounts are technically legal for hedge funds.... but when you look at the itemized holdings of these funds on Citadel's most recent form ADV, it gives me chills..
Form ADV page 105-106....
https://preview.redd.it/ho4j0oghg9q61.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=147c10a38cfc2857b4b2691fe70f088a88e83091
Ok... ok.... let me get this straight....
 1. The repo market provides IMMEDIATE liquidity to hedge funds and other financial institutions
 2. After the MBS collapse in 2008, the US Treasury replaced it as the liquid asset of choice
 3. Citadel owns 100% of Palafox Trading which is a market maker for repo agreements
 4. This market maker provides liquidity to the Global Fixed Income Master Fund LTD (GFIL) through Citadel Advisors
 5. 80% of its $123,218,147,399 in assets under management belong to entities in the Cayman Islands
Ok.....I tore the bermuda, paradise, and panama papers apart and found that all of these funds boil down to just a few managers, but can't pin anything on them for money laundering... However, if there EVER were a case for it, I'd be extremely suspicious of this one...
The level of shade on all this is INCREDIBLE... There should be NO ROOM for a investment pool as big as Citadel to hide this sh*t.... absolutely ridiculous..
The fact that there is so much foreign influence over our bond &amp; repo market, which controls the liquidity of our country, is VERY concerning..

Step 4: Short-seller Endgame
Alright, I know this is a lot to take in..
I've been writing this post for a week, so reading it all at one time is probably going to make your head explode.. But now we can finally start putting all of this together.
Ok, remember how I explained that the repo rate started to rise in '08 because the collateral was no longer attractive compared to cash? That means there wasn't enough liquidity in the system. Well this time the OPPOSITE effect is happening. Ever since March 2020, the short-term lending rate (repo rate) has nearly dropped to 0.0%....
https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/treasury-repo-reference-rates
So the fed is printing free money, the repo market is lending free money, and there's basically NO difference between the collateral that's being lent and the cash that's being received.. With all this free money going around, it's no wonder why the price of the 10 year treasury has been declining.
In fact, hedge funds are SO confident that the 10 year treasury will continue to decline, that they've SHORTED THE 10-YEAR BOND MARKET. I'm not talking about speculative shorting, I mean shorting it to oblivion like they've shorted stocks.
Don't believe me?
Hedge funds like Citadel Advisors must first locate the treasury bond in order to swap them for cash in the repo market. It's extremely difficult to do this with the fed because they're tied up in government BS, so they locate a lender in the market. Now who would Citadel know that's an asset manager?
Perhaps the SAME asset manager that they borrow shares from - BlackRock. It's now obvious why BlackRock was tapped by the US Government to purchase their treasuries.
https://preview.redd.it/d83rby6mg9q61.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13f248c705140dade0d286a2108b1807f3b3ea6d
So BlackRock purchases a sh*t load of treasuries and keeps them on reserve for hedgies like Citadel to short. Citadel comes along and asks for the bond, they throw it into Palafox Trading and collect their cash. So what happens when they need to pay for their repo agreement? Surely to GOD there are enough bonds floating around, right? Not unless hedge funds like Citadel have shorted more bonds than there are available.
Here's the evidence.
There have been 3 instances over the past year where the repo rate dipped below the """"failure"""" rate of -3.0%. On March 4th 2021, the repo rate hit -4.25% which means that investors were willing to PAY someone 4.25% interest to lend THEIR OWN MONEY in exchange for a 10 year treasury bond.
This is a major signal of a squeeze in the treasury market. It's MAJOR desperation to find bonds. With the federal reserve purchasing them monthly from the open market, it leaves room for a shortage when the repo call hits. If an entity like BlackRock hasn't purchased more treasuries since lending them out, hedge funds like Citadel simply cannot cover unless they go into the market and PAY the bond holder for their bond. It's literally the same story as all of the heavily shorted stocks.
Still not convinced?
At the end of 2020, Palafox Trading listed $31,257,102,000 (BILLION) in GROSS repo agreements. $30,576,918,000 (BILLION) were directly related to repurchasing treasury bonds....
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
But what about their Reverse Repurchase agreements? Don't they have assets to BUY treasury bonds?SURE.. Take a look..
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
SeE tHeRe? I tOlD yOu ThEy HaD iT cOvErEd..
Yeaaaah... now read the fine print.
I know the totals are slightly different than the balance above, but they're both from 2020. It's just how they are presented. Check for yourself. (https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170)
So no, they don't have it covered. Why? Because our POS financial system allows for rehypothecation, that's why. It's a big fancy word for using amounts owed to you as collateral for another transaction. In the event that the party defaults, SO DO YOU.
This means that the securities which Palafox is waiting to receive, have ALREADY been pledged to pay off the bonds they currently OWE to someone else.
Does this sound familiar? Promising to repay something with something you don't already have? Basically you need to wait on Ted, to repay Steve, to repay Jan, to repay Mark, to repay you, so you can repay Fred, so Fred can.... Yeah, REAAAAL secure..
OH, and by the way, the problem is getting WORSE.
Here's Palafox's financial statements in 2018:
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
And 2019:
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170
The amount in 2020 is STILL +100% greater than 2019, AFTER netting (which is even more bullsh*t).
https://sec.report/CIK/0001284170

All of this made me wonder what the FICC's balance is for treasury deposits... For those of you that don't know, the FICC is a branch of the DTCC that deals with government securities.
Just like the updated DTC rule for supplemental liquidity deposits being calculated throughout the day, the FICC also calculates this amount as it relates to treasury securities multiple times throughout the day.
Would you be surprised that the FICC has $47,000,000,000 (BILLION) just in DEPOSITS for unsettled treasury bonds? $47,000,000,000!?!?!?
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW ASTRONOMICAL THE ACTUAL MARGIN MUST BE?!
https://preview.redd.it/zrkpzdb1h9q61.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f6b10aca2566bcf9b5d560967af3715104b839

There is TOO much evidence, from TOO many separate events, pointing to the imminent default of something big. That's all this is going to take. When Ted can't repay Steve, it means the panic has already started. Just look at how easy it was for the repo rate to spike overnight in 2019..
We are already starting to see the consequences of the SLR update with Archegos, Nomura, and Credit Suisse. This is just a taste of what's to come.. and now we know the bond market represents an even BIGGER catalyst in triggering this event.. and it's happening already.
With that being said, things finally started to make sense... Citadel doesn't NEED shares if their investment strategy to go short on EVERYTHING instead of going long. Why bother owning shares? BlackRock and other asset managers simply lend them to you when you need to pony up a margin call for stocks and bonds..
Their HFT systems allow them to manipulate the market in their favor so there's NO way they could fail.... unless.... a bunch of degenerates all decided to ignore taking profits...
But that would NEVER happen, right?
...wrong...
we just like the stonks

2048,"&gt;The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

TLDR: Bitcoin Institutional FOMO Hype train is still ongoing and so is the Bull Market!!

2053,"I tries posting this in /BitcoinBeginners but it kept saying the moderators removed it.

I have a question with regard to transfer fees and coin movement.

I recently decided to move my portfolio from eToro to Coinbase Pro and BlockFi. Unfortunately there was no way to move directly from eToro without using the eToro wallet. So I requested my BTC be transferred to my eToro wallet. After it arrived I attempted to make a deposit into my BlockFi account.

This is where I ran into an issue. The eToro wallet said I had an available balance and gave an estimated Blockchain fee. So I requested a transfer of my available balance minus the transfer fee to my BlockFi account. It was rejected shortly after saying that I requested more than my available balance due possibly due to the Blockchain fee. I kept trying to lower the amount in tiny increments until I finally was able to get a successful deposit. But just as I had feared when I went back to my eToro wallet there is a small amount  orphaned there. Now it looks like I can't move that tiny amount because the fee is higher than the value of that balance.

How can I get this last bit out of my wallet?

Also, how can I avoid this in the future moving coins between my cold wallet and Coinbase Pro/BlockFi? I searched all over for Blockchain calculator but was unsuccessful.

 ***A longtime Bitcoin bull and the founder of Galaxy Digital Michael Novogratz*** [***spoke about Bitcoin's future.***](https://news.bitcoin.com/boomers-adopt-cryptocurrency-trillion-dollars-bitcoin-novogratz/)

He explained that as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, rich baby boomers will be the next generation to come to the bitcoin market.

&gt;*“It could be as much as a trillion dollars comes over the next year from that giant group of wealth."""" - declared Novogratz.*

Baby Boomers are those who were born around the end of World War II until the mid-1960s. They were the main beneficiaries of the massive stimulus packages that pumped asset values ​​in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Many of them see bitcoin as an asset that can significantly increase its value, as well as protect their savings from inflation caused by the massive printing of money.

&gt;*""""If you’re worried that the U.S. is printing too many dollars … you’re going to shift some of your savings into bitcoin.""""*  
*- Michael Novgorats.*

If the CEOs of JMP Securities and Galaxy Digital are not wrong, then in the coming months, huge amounts of money will begin to flow into the bitcoin market, and by the end of the year, their inflow will amount to $2.5 trillion. Now the capitalization of the first cryptocurrency is $1.2 trillion. If you add these two sums, then the capitalization of BTC by the end will reach $3.7 trillion, hence the price of bitcoin will be $177,754.

But since in free circulation, according to Glassnode, at the beginning of the year there were only 4.2 million bitcoins, a reasonable question arises: *what exactly are the listed groups of investors going to buy?* Everything that is available to them on the market today, taking into account all the bitcoins available on exchange wallets and in OTC, is a maximum of 4.2 million BTC.

If we subtract from the total emission of bitcoin, which is 18.6 million today, belonging to the class of illiquid 14.5 million, then the estimated price of bitcoin will be **$711,000 by the end of the year**. And this is without taking into account the money of other buyers, who, of course, are present in the market and their number is growing all the time. It is worth adding an element of common panic buying that can arise against the backdrop of the rapid rise in the price of BTC.

Last year alone, Grayscale Capital and other funds bought about 1 million bitcoins on the market. Under the above-mentioned scenario, no more than 1 million BTC will remain in free circulation by the end of the year.

**Turns out, “To The Moon” is much closer than expected.**

Thanks to Michael Novogratz for the tip."

2084,"The bitcoin network does \*not\* transfer money.  


What is the ontological status of a bitcoin?  
Bitcoins are proofs that computers performed a series of pointless math calculations.  


These proofs are \*not\* monetary instruments, securities, bonds, obligations. They have nothing to do with finance. A bitcoin does \*not\* entitle its holder to anything whatsoever. A dollar while subjective in value allows me to pay objective tax obligations. The dollar itself has \*no\* value, what has \*value\* is that which labor power created. Dollars just allow us to organize labor power in more complex interactions. That is \*all\* money is.  


Comparing to Visa is completely meaningless considering that visa process payments of actual dollars. Visa \*shifts\* dollars between balance sheets. Bitcoin does \*not\*.   


The ownership of bitcoin may change based on who holds the private key but that is \*not\* the same thing as transferring money.  


Just because bitcoin has the nominal word COIN in it does \*not\* make it money. Names reflect \*essences\* that are \*knowable\* however inprecisely to us. They are real.  


So lets stop it with the claims that the bitcoin network transfers 'billions'. It transfers the ownership of a proof that computers performed pointless math problems.   


What is the \*economic value\* of these proofs? To determine that we ask, does bitcoin improve the efficiency of energy transfer? Do I get more output with less input? The answer is no.   


So the economic value of bitcoin is zero. If bitcoin mining \*does not\* locate a power source which is near free, the entire network will collapse."

He immediately  introduced me into this crypto space (started with Bitcoin) but couldn’t understand much about investing in it; I was just following what he was saying without much  idea of what I was doing. Though excited when my first investment rose with the rise of Bitcoin value, I only got frustrated when it dipped from $67k to $54k within a month.

2102,"Hey there, still learning my way around crypto (as will become evident), sorry if this post somehow breaks the rules.

Tl;Dr: I had a large amount of crypto stolen from me and I'm seeking experienced opinion on CNC Intelligence who claim to have experience in asset recovery, among other things. I'm not looking for other security tips or to be reminded of how I could have better protected myself, I just need help with discerning the legitimacy of this company.

Please try to resist posting if you don't have relevant evidence or specific experience dealing with CNC Intelligence; It's been very difficult to come to peace with what happened to me because I've had a hard time discerning palpable evidence into the legitimacy of this company who claim to be capable of helping in crypto retrieval. My scam-alarm is ringing at high volume, so I'm looking for legitimate, experienced feedback to help me decide whether to proceed with their services.

I had BTC / ETH stolen from me last week, and in a bid to try and recoup some of the lost cost, after contacting police and the brokerage I held the coin on, I reached out to numerous 'crypto asset recovery' companies after long and panicked googling. 

CNC Intelligence / CNCIntel have been the only ones to respond; I've exchanged communications with a representative, they've ostensibly examined the TxIDs and determined that 'something' can be done to get the coin back. 

I'm aware that BTC and ETH transactions are irreversible. Thus, the only way I'd naively understand to get anything out of this would be to either convince the current holders to return funds (I guess a bribe would be involved) or to serve as expert witnesses to police. Both seem to have incredibly poor success rates on the face of them.

In researching CNCIntel / intelligence, it's very difficult to find much of what I would perceive as a legitimate footprint online. No one is talking about them, they have a very dubious trustpilot page and a handful of puff-piece articles written by the company themselves to promote what they claim to be able to do. They seem to have created a similarly dubious subreddit about two weeks ago.

Not a good sign amongst any of it.

They certainly seem to be an actually registered company, both in Washington and Israel, but I'm going to assume this is not too difficult to setup. They're either a scam, or are terrible at creating a reassuring image for themselves; I would be too, but I'm also not claiming to be a company that can help people in desperate hours of need.

So. Does anyone have any legitimate experience with the company, any of its known staff or at the least experience dealing with similar 'asset retrieval' firms? I'd made peace with the idea that my money was gone, but I'm in turmoil again because I can't get enough of a bearing to know that I'm in safe hands here or not.

2110,"Last week i was gutted that i didnt have funds available to buy when it was considerably cheaper. I now have a few thousand that i can put in.

This is crystal ball stuff i know, but do you guys think I should i drip this in over a few days/weeks, or YOLO it in now?"
2111,"I was looking into how the community feels about BlockFi and been reading your comments about it I’d just like to clear something up I believe a lot of people are not understanding about this.

I kept reading something along the lines of “why risk your BTC which appreciates on average 100% a year (in fiat) for an extra 6%” and that’s is just _incorrect_  on all fronts, let me make a case for it.

First of all let me mention about the “risk” which is completely overblown. BlockFi did not shutdown withdrawals even during the March dump of 2020, so short of a complete market collapse I don’t believe they would have any problems with liquidations. Furthermore, people lose cold storage BTC everyday and yet BlockFi has _never_ lost a single BTC so they’re way safer statistically speaking than cold storage.

Second let me mention the interest, the big point that a lot of you are missing is that interest is paid out IN KIND, you earn 6% not on your fiat you earn that on your BTC. So the argument about risking it all for 6% is just not valid.

Let’s say to make it easy that you deposit 1.6 BTC - at the end of the year you would have 0.1 BTC more than you had before so 1.7 BTC total. If BTC increases 100% thats 100% that you missed out, plus this interest compounds so it should be even higher than that once all is said and done. I’d say that returns like this are definitely worth the risk but that’s just me, I like small risk high rewards situation and this is one of those.

Lastly I’d urge you to stop thinking about fiat, that 100% price appreciation is meaningless, if you’re talking about stacking sats which is the only important thing you can do right now, BlockFi is the _best_ place to do that, you’re literally stacking sats passively without any action from you. Don’t miss out on this because of not your keys not your coins."

I tried using this address to log in my wallet but it says it's invalid.

It’s a very long episode, but I have to say I enjoyed every bit of it. Balaji is a proponent of Bitcoin, and talks about various considerations for the future of crypto. Note it covers other things too like the future of warfare, but it’s all worth a listen.

Founded 1729.com. Newsletter paying people in Bitcoin for a wide variety of tasks or interactions. (recent was Proof of Workout, send in a workout themed picture or video and top 100 received $10 in Bitcoin). $25 in BTC for “Ascending the world” examples based on description he gave.

Most interesting I found relating to Bitcoin was discussing the threats of China/US/India.
China - The Great Firewall - Potentially blocking miners from the outside world. Could open and close to create some havoc as the chains merge. Could create a cat and mouse game between China/Bitcoin.  Outright ban, coupled with asset seizure to really kill it within the country.
US - Regulations, which could complicate it for businesses. No substantial impact, but it would slow growth.
India - Not sure how effective a ban would be, not nearly to the level China is in regards to firewall and enforcement. On the flip side could benefit greatly by embracing it.

He discusses Miami and their Mayor vs California. While cities/states are spending big to attract businesses, he’s tweeting and potentially redefining their future by being pro-crypto/tech.

2130,"Hypothetical scenario. Let’s say I take a $25,000 loan out on 1 BTC (assume currently at $50,000), with an entry price of $10,000. The loan is set at 50% loan-to-value and the bank holds custody of the bitcoin with an automatic liquidation on the collateral set up for -40% from the current price (say this is at $30,000 where it will liquidate). 

If I have the $25,000 cash from the loan, and we have a flash crash where my bitcoin is liquidated with bank taking 100% of the $30k proceeds, will I have to pay taxes on the gains from the theoretical $20k in gains on bitcoin ($30k - $10k)? Similarly, can I claim a capital loss on the bitcoin investment of $10,000 to apply to offset another capital gain in the future?"

2141,"The best advice you will ever receive on any crypto subreddit is #1 -- """"Use a Passphrase with your Seed"""".

This is important for a number of reasons, such as.... If a friend, family, maintenance man, hardware wallet manufacturer (or malware spoofer), or even hacker who found your screenshot of your seed (even tho you were told not to screenshot your seed) gains access to your seed, then it's as good as gone.

Even a $5 wrench attack could beat your seed out of you, which could point to a """"dummy"""" wallet with 0.002 BTC or whatever in it. Little would the attacker know that you could be using MULTIPLE passphrases with that seed, each providing access to a completely unique wallet.

This is another benefit -- organization. You can have a main wallet passphrase you can occasionally disperse smaller sums to your wife, kids for spending money or what have you. All of you share the same seed, yet only the """"master"""" would really be able to gain access to the master wallet.

Such an easy, easy thing to do to protect your coins with what is essentially a mostly memorable passphrase. I know that people don't want to talk about """"collision"""" possibilities of 12 and 24 word seeds, but if ONE person or app in 100,000 years were to randomly generate a seed that points to a wallet with a substantial amount of coin in it... and there were no passphrase... that coin is also as good as gone.

Protect yourself with a passphrase, and for the love of God, PLEASE stop saying """"seed phrase"""". That shit is so confusing when there is a seed &amp; a passphrase. Perhaps passphrase should be renamed to password, which many apps also use... but until then... Use a passphrase WITH your seed."

In my opinion Bitcoin and its' four-year cycle is the best example. The main event of the cycle is halving (halving the rewards of mining the Bitcoin ), which is causing supply-shock and aftermath in the form of speculative bubble.

I strongly believe we are about to see a supercycle in Uranium in the following years. Spot price of that commodity is right now under-valued to such an extent Cameco ( one of its largest global providers) is buying it from the spot market in order to meet the contracts and keeping some of its mines closed (waiting for the prices to rise). Currently there are about 440 active nuclear reactors and 50 being constructed (more than 10% of the actual number) mainly in China and India (respectively 16 and 6 as of March 2021). Interesting pair, isn't it? If the rest of the world does not want to stay behind they will have no choice but to follow that direction.

Therefore your return on investment is the same as well, because the ratio is always kept no matter the initial amount of zeroes for a unit (1 BTC).

However, the unit bias aka our instinctual need for completion puts us off buying because we cannot obtain 1 full BTC now as easily as we could have years ago.

However, investing now is as fruitful as it was the last few years and the next few years for the sole reason the ratio or ROI stays more or less the same regardless of the initial price.

I wanted to make a payment via bitcoin so i made an etoro account and bought some via paypal.

when i tried to transfer them to my wallet etoro told me i cant do that , i have to wait 60 days because i bought them via PayPal. So i just sold them again and took my money back.I was wondering if i could just do the same again but instead with bank transfer to be able to transfer them without any delay. They said there is no delay when you are paying with bank transfer but the examples they list in the FAQ make me confused.

 

Here are some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your first deposit was $200 via credit  card. After a month, you made a further deposit of $1,000 via bank  transfer. You opened a Bitcoin position with $1,200, but now it is only  worth $800. You can transfer the position now because the current value  of the position is lower than the amount deposited via bank transfer.  
 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You are a Bronze user and your first  deposit was $400 via bank transfer. After a month, you made a further  deposit of $600 via credit card. You opened a Bitcoin position with  $1,000. You can transfer the position, but only after 60 days have  passed since your first deposit (because you are a Bronze user and a  credit card was used to deposit).

(1) Let's say somebody bought 1 BTC a year ago.  Transfers it off exchange to his own wallet.

(2) Just yesterday, this person decides to buy $100 of BTC every Monday, but keep these DCA investments on the exchange to save on multiple transaction fees.

MY QUESTIONS.....

(1) Now that the FIFO and LIFO transactions are technically separated (First In is in personal wallet, Last In is on exchange)... If said person spends from either wallet or exchange, is this coin really distinguishable??   Because if they were in the same wallet they wouldn't be....  So would one need to make sure to spend, sell from one account or the other, or do all your coins just need to be recorded correctly / consistently as wholly owned by you? 
 Hope this is understandable....

(2) Which method would be better for this person if they want to keep as much BTC as possible, with as little fiat as possible... But *might* need to pull some money out in a few months??

I would think FIFO, because that way you don't have to pay short term capital gains, right

But OTOH, I was just thinking about this.  If this hypothetical person puts in $100/WK for 10 weeks, then needs to pull out $1,000... Even tho he'd have to pay more capital gains tax (10 weeks definitely short-term), his gain would be a lot less if he would need to withdraw some, since he's obviously riding a tight rope keeping 99% in BTC and only 1% or even less of possible in fiat.

As users utilize this as a payment method for millions of merchants, other application and established institutions are sure to follow suit.

I have been talking about bitcoins for the better part of a decade. I'd often have conversations with friends and family and coworkers about this subject (including my, now boss, but then co-worker years ago). For a while when bitcoin was in the news my coworkers knew I was the 'bitcoin buy' to talk to about it. Back in early days people would ask """"How many bitcoins do you have?"""" etc. Luckily, I never answered that question.

However, now with the price movements over the last several months and the just the general amount of press it has received, I am starting to realize people's attitude toward me has started to shift. In 2017, I mentioned perhaps after too much wine, that we had """"made"""" like 10k in one day to my mother-in-law and then the other day I said something was expensive and she replied to the effect of """"what does price matter to you?"""" and so on. Coworkers same story. In a meeting the other day my boss introduced me """"the guy that's just working for fun, because he is a bitcoin millionaire"""". Of course I joke it off.

I do not want to flaunt my wealth, and I think that in another world, if I had made a ton on general investing for instance, sure I might have discussed investing with friends, but they wouldn't have known I had made this much because I wouldn't have done much to show it. Maybe take an early or partial retirement, but I am keeping my same car and house and what not and I'd prefer for lots of reasons, mainly that people are really weird about money, that anyone but especially friends and family don't know exactly to what extent our net worth has grown (obviously the taxing authorities in our country would have some idea when and if I sell for fiat).

My wife and I have adopted a 'steer the conversation away from bitcoin' strategy for now. But I \*do\* want to talk about them. 

I'm thinking some here are the same boat.

I would theoretically be having the BTC sent to my mobile wallet, but I'm not sure how I would exchange this into real money - and I was wondering if it would be possible to link my wallet to CashApp (or just send the money to the CashApp wallet), sell the $5000 worth of BTC on CashApp, and then withdraw from a linked bank account. Or, is it possible to simply exchange the $5000 BTC to PayPal without going through an actual exchange service like Coinbase or Paxful? If neither of these are very good, in the future I would probably make a Coinbase account and just use that.

2218,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a complete noob in this area. I invested in bitcoin back in 2017 with some spare money I had and I've been holding since.

Now I don't need that money so I won't be selling anytime soon but I've been thinking. What's the end game here? When does one actually sell? Will that time even ever come? 

I've heard of many stories and I'm sure you all have as well about people selling ridiculous amounts of bitcoin for a pizza or something similar and how those are worth in the millions now. Will it ever truly reach a point where it holds its same value long enough for people to not find it a waste to spend it? 

Like I personally have thought about selling a bit here and there to buy a few things in the past but there's always been that thought in the back of my head telling me I'd be making a huge mistake... and it turns out it was right, because its gone up since. 

Seems to me like we're stuck in this endless loop of buying and never selling, for the most part, and it will continue rising even if very slowly at times, so it will always be a waste to sell. 

Please let me know your thoughts about all this and maybe help me understand some misconceptions I might have here!

I'm trying to learn here more than anything, please be kind.

2233,"It is no doubt ideal to hold real bitcoin when you want to be secured by a the worlds strongest decentralized blockchain. However, if you are also trying to speculate on the price could GBTC have gone from being a terrible deal to a great deal?

As you likely know GBTC has gone from high premiums to steep discounts. As of close yesterday GBTC closed with a 8.2% discount to assets. GBTC does have a very high annual fee of 2%. However, I think it is very reasonable to think that over the next two years GBTC could transition into an ETF eroding the discount. Not many exchanges will give you a discount on Bitcoin. 

Of course there are many limitations such as you can't easily transfer it, lend it, or have the keys. However, I think it is not completely unreasonable to think that the discount on GBTC could actually become a benefit for owners of it. 

To be clear I own shares of GBTC and trade it in client accounts. So I have a vested interest in it doing well. I would certainly hold real bitcoin if that was something available in the environment I work in. I also hold real bitcoin too."

2237,"So lets say the worst happens and some of these big funds are forced to liquidate their holdings as they're over leveraged on cheap margin (during the past year the banks increased their lending to increase liquidity during the pandemic, that money went to funds who bought in at market lows causing the stock market to rise). The people who lent them money are afraid of a downturn in the market that would lose them their principal, and are now trying to get it back at .75 or less on the dollar and not end up as bag holders who didn't get any of their loaned money back. When the lenders liquidate the funds to get their money back they'll sell the funds holdings at a discount (this is the cents on the dollar), tanking the markets in large block sales (ex: Viacom, Discovery).

During the housing crash the Government jumped in to bail out the banks (the bagholders of junk housing bonds), the DTCC (rule 2021- 004) said they're not planning on doing that (bailing out the bagholders). Leaving the Government as a possible lifeline. 

If the government tries to bail the lenders who didn't get their money out, they'll make the dollar less valuable and force even more printing causing a downward spiral leading to hyperinflation and a weak dollar with very little buying power.

If the government doesn't bail out the bagholding banks they could fail, also tanking the market. This would lead to a downturn in the market until those with cash reserves will buy in at huge discounts (&gt;90% in some cases).

Does this mean Bitcoin is the savior in either situation here? Laws of supply and demand say no. How many large institutional investors would cash out their bitcoin to USD to cover their other assets? Unless the DTCC starts allowing you to buy shares in companies directly with bitcoin, this event could also bring Bitcoins value down at least in the short term. 

There are some BIG assumptions here.

2241,"Net worth across today's all asset classes:

Gold + coins/notes + electronic bank ledgers = $10t + $10t + $80t = $100t USD

Real Estate = $200t USD

Equities = $100t USD

Bonds = $100t USD

Gold + coins/notes + bank ledgers  are all directly replaceable by Bitcoins as a store of value and a medium of exchange, so we will assume a **30% conversion rate** from these to Bitcoin. Think of it as people selling  their fiat for Bitcoin and HODL (which is what we all do here on this forum)

Real Estate, Equities and Bonds are different asset classes in comparison to Bitcoin but they still have store of value function baked in their prices, so we will assume a modest **5% conversion rate** from these to Bitcoin. These are from the people selling their houses, stocks and bonds to put into Bitcoin, might involve institutional purchasers like pension fund which is swapping out highly priced stocks and low yielding bonds to buy Bitcoin.

$100t x 30% + $400t x 5% = $50t, that's the market cap for Bitcoin after having absorbed the value from all other asset classes

There is one fact which annoys me a lot: So BTC was published earlier, around 2009.

Or just normal normal people
Who mined a couple thousand btc’s when they were still worthless. These people are super rich now compared to people who are jumping in now since it got more awareness. 

This is just unfair. A lot of people missed the train. Therefore, I am somehow not okay with that. Also I am not okay with institutions buying bitcoin. I wish an altcoin like ethereum would be the ‘new’ bitcoin but then i thought, that the same thoughts i just applied on bitcoin might apply to ethereum in 10 years.

I’m still keen on this solution. But then...

I stumbled across Ledn.io and after a fair bit of due diligence they seem to check out using Bitgo as custody and very open about how they make money whilst securing (not insuring I know) their clients money and I was satisfied. I can even see my Bitcoin on the blockchain with their proof of reserves so I know it’s not been misused. I really like that the CEO is such a public figure on YouTube so if it all goes wrong we know who to blame. But he comes across very well. And the business model is pretty low risk assuming Bitcoin doesn’t go to 0 but at that point it won’t matter.

I’ve done a reasonable amount of research, and yes I’ve heard the saying ‘not your keys, not your crypto’. But the other-side of the coin is that exchanges, Ledn, Blockfi etc spend a ton on their security right? And Mount Gox was a long time ago.

Anyhow I’ve put all my Bitcoin in Ledn.io and wanted to sense check it against some more experienced levelheaded coiners. So please let me know what you all do?"

2271,"Hello to all,

Is there a way to properly export the private key of the entire HD wallet generated through Bitcoin-Qt?

I tried both like this:

1. `getnewaddress`
2. `dumpprivkey` *step1-key*
3. `importprivkey` *step2-key*

&amp;#x200B;

Which like this:

1. `dumpwallet`
2. Make Blank Wallet &gt; Yes
3. `importprivkey` *Master\_Private\_Key\_ (from\_ """"dumpwallet"""")*

&amp;#x200B;

The result of the first method was that the imported wallet reported """"*HD key generation is* ***disabled***""""; while the result of the second method was the error message: """"*Invalid private key encoding (code -5)*"""".

What am I doing wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

To make you understand better, I would like to understand what is (how and where to find it) the private key that in the future allows me to import my current SegWit wallet, generated through Bitcoin-Qt, always into Bitcoin-Qt, making sure that it maintains the same functions that has now, but without having the backup file available but only this alphanumeric code.

2285,"I've read a good bit about Bitcoin, but there is one question that bothers me a lot: 

**""""Bitcoin fixes inflation"""" &lt;- is this really true?** 

*1. Fed conducts monetary policy*

In the economy as it is right now, the federal reserve controls the money supply using open market operations (monetary policy). If it wants to increase the money supply, they buy bonds from banks (gives banks more money) If it wants to decrease the money supply, they sell bonds to the banks (takes money from banks). 

AFAIK, This is how the Fed """"prints"""" money. By buying bonds from banks. Not using a printing press. 

*2. Monetary policy helps mitigate recession &amp; control inflation*

AFAIK, we need this monetary policy because it helps control unemployment and inflation throughout the business cycle. There's a classic explanation from Ray Dalio's youtube vid on economic machine. Businesses need loans, banks give out loans, the leverage stimulates growth, economy expands. At some point, businesses need to pay back loans, and business growth stifles, economy contracts, potentailly to recession or panic.  

If businesses and banks start using unsustainable amount of loans. They increase the interest rate (reduces incentive for taking out loans, therefore reduces money supply, reduces inflation) and limits expansion. The fed can also stimulate growth in a recession by lowering interest rates (increases money supply), and mitigating the contraction. 

*3. Currently, we equate growth to inflation* 

As we've seen, growth comes from loans. loans create 'new money' that businesses can use for growth. Creating this 'new money' inevitably increase the money supply, and leads to inflation. 

AFAIK, the only way economy grows with deflation is if the country's production, usually through some innovation, creates more goods than is demanded, and purchasing power of the currency increases. But this is an ideal scenario, usually is not the case in a lot of countries. Most times, businesses need loans to grow. 

*4. Bitcoin is deflationary.* 

Yes, you can't create bitcoin out of thin air like the fed buys bonds from banks. The increase in supply will asymptotically reach an end, and there will be limited supply. 

Limited supply + demand in the money(btc) market  = deflation. 

**Expanding money supply is needed for economic growth, but Bitcoin has limited supply...**

5. Bitcoin as a """"solution"""" to inflation (ignoring the tech or commodity view, just currency)

It's true that bitcoin is not deflationary. But this deflation seems different from the natural positive deflation the economy wants. The 'positive' deflation comes from the ecnomy's growth in production, and where businesses produce so much that they start lowering prices and increasing purchase power of the currency. On the other hand, Bitcoin's deflation is from its limited supply unrelated to economic growth.

Yes, current inflation sucks because increase in money supply devalues currency while appreciating asssets. This reduces purchasing power of the lower income class that owns less assets and enriches the upper class that owns a lot of assets. This sucks. Bitcoin does prevent this from happening which is good. But if money supply can not expand, how could the government stimulate economic growth? 

***6. Central question:*** *can there by economic growth without expanding the bitcoin supply?* 

There will inevitably be a period of economic slowdown where production slows and unemployment rises. If there is no way to incentivize loans in the bitcoin system (unlike the fed who can lower interest rates), there will be no solution to recover from a recession. 

**Conclusion/TLDR:** In a decentralized system of wallets and bitcoins with no banks, and where there is no way to incentivize increase or decrease of money supply, there will be no business cycle of expansion and contraction. If we cannot create credit, economy cannot be driven forward. Then how can bitcoin be sustainable as a global currency?"

2290,"Not investment advice. At all.

There's three main reasons I've determined people hfsp. For those that don't know, this means have fun staying poor. This is not ONLY money...this is also a state of mind.

1. Risk avoidance. You can have hfsp in $, but you can also hfsp in friends, dating, health, and overall happiness. I have 2 friends who literally refuse to make any real attempts at dating, and then wonder why they don't have relationships. I don't hate to break it to you-life has risks. Any surefire or easy bet is a fast path to the poor house. You know who I think buys bitcoin when it's """"safe"""". The people at $500,000. In this climate of massive prin$ing, I believe saving tons of cash is a sure fire way to poverty. Avoiding all risk is the biggest risk of all.
2. No real plans. Do you have a plan? I sure as hell don't for much of my life. I better write it down. You know why gamblers lose? Because their real plan is to leave the casino with no money left. Write your goals down. I'm over the bitcoin maximalist stuff coming from people who try to shame those who sell. Some people in crypto have $10,000,000 and no family-they can take the massive swings. Other's can't. Whether your goal is to get to $10,000 or $100,000,000-write your goals down, and how you expect to get there. Most of my friends who have not bought homes have not done so because of lack of $-in fact, they have the highest paying jobs, the most saved, etc...they have no plan.
3. Don't be a victim-educate yourself. Do you think you are smart? I'm sure as hell not. Most of us are average, and many below average, thinkers. You want to make $? Go after the people that have real $$. Understand what it took. Ask questions. Don't be fake. Ask real questions. Go on twitter. Look up videos on youtube. Look at the pros and cons. Don't try to be a smart ass....try to educate yourself.

And maybe...you don't have to be HFSP."

Ok ladies &amp; gents,

To some, this recent pull back might look like a repeat of the correction after Elon's candle but it's not.

Here's why:

1. Adoption is increasing (Visa, MasterCard, Tesla, Square, PayPal, JPM, GS, BNY, BlackRock). All of these companies don't mess around and are all taking action towards adopting crypto.
2. Inflation - Do I really need to explain this? Go look at the M2 money supply or the price of any commodity over the last year and you'll get the picture
3. Interest rates might be increasing but they can't go that high. Look up Operation Twist for more info, this is a can of worms I don't want to open right now but basically short-term rates are going up for the near future and long-term rates will go down incentivizing long-term investment in the economy. This will balance out over time and people worrying about rates jumping shouldn't because it would literally break the entire world economy if you don't believe me refer to #2
4. The price is being manipulated right now for either institutions (most likely) or whales to accumulate at a lower price

Proof:

This is called a sell wall. To newbies, this may look like someone trying to offload a bunch of BTC so they can get out but this is an extremely common tactic seen in both the traditional financial markets as well as cryptocurrency markets. It works particularly well in crypto because volume is so low. The idea is (relatively) simple. Pretend you want to buy a bunch of BTC without pushing the price up too much. You can't buy it all at once so you need to spread it out over time. But hang on, doing that will cause a bunch of green candles in a row and everybody and their mom will jump in on the action so what do you do?

You pretend you're selling a bunch for more than what you want to buy it for. This will scare people into selling at or below your sell wall, allowing you to buy up all their BTC for the price you want. Once you have what you want, you take away the sell wall (prepare for launch) and buy up until people join in (to the moon) . This is what happening literally right now so if you're selling stop. My guess is there will be an announcement soon about another company investing in BTC or an investment bank/hedge fund just got they're trading desk running.

TL;DR - Always buy the dip."

My question is, will there always be some kind of lending market for Bitcoin out into the future? And if so, is this likely to be the primary way most people generate some kind of passive income from their Bitcoin hodlings?

As the market grows and more players get into the game, my suspicion is that interest rates for Bitcoin lending will go lower and lower as more and more people and institutions realize how pristine of an asset Bitcoin is. Does it ever get to the point where the rate people are willing to pay to borrow Bitcoins (for whatever purposes, and no, they're NOT just shorting, a lot of it is for """"risk free"""" market making) is assumed to be the de fact risk free rate of return?

As time goes on, will lending out your hodlings (or a part of your hodlings) still be thing for generating passive income and living on your Bitcoin stack without having to sell any part of your stack? Or is borrowing/lending Bitcoin just a fad that will one day disappear?

How could we all be wrong about bitcoin? My theory is if you don’t know how you can be wrong about your investment thesis then you probably are in some way.

How can I buy bitcoin fully, 100% anonymously. Is there a way?

I was under the impression that I downloaded a key logger or somesort of malware.

Im continuing to wonder how a hacker or scammer can access my wallet and send my funds to themselves.
My password is secure.
Private key written on paper.
Nobody has access to my computer.
Electrum version and download verified.
Did not download an update of any sort. 

I have downloaded 1 pirated program and bought a windows key on ebay so im thinking thats what the problem is.

How do I prevent this from happening a 3rd time? 

Im thinking about buying a $100 laptop to store funds on there and not download anything else on there or just change and start using cakewallet on my phone.

Should I reset my computer again?"

2360,"PRESS RELEASE. MPH Club announced that they will allow their clients to pay in bitcoin to rent cars. MPH Club is a Miami-based exotic and luxury car rental that allows their customers to vacation in style. Their fleet includes the newest models from Lamborghini, Ferrari, McLaren, Rolls Royce, and others.

They offer a few services, which include:

Rentals
Membership
Chauffeurs
Corporate events
Vehicle delivery
Hotel and airport pickup
Partnership program
Their service is incredibly popular and has been used by the likes of Steve Aoki, Floyd Mayweather, and Shaquille O’Neal. Part of the reason for their popularity is that they are able to offer such a wide selection is due to their partnership program.

The MPH Club Partnership Program – This service allows local exotic car owners to “lend” their cars to MPH Club. MPH Club will then add it to their fleet and offer it to their customers to rent out, usually at an average price of $1,000 per day. If the car rents then MPH Club will split the profit with the car owner.

This program has allowed them to grow their business at an incredible rate and bring their service to almost every major city in Florida.

Benefits of the service

Part of the reason that MPH Club is so popular is because of the convenience that they offer to their clients. For one thing, their locations include Miami, Ft Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Naples, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee. They also offer hotel and airport pickup to make the rental process as simple as possible for their clients.

Since many of these cities are major vacation hubs (particularly Miami), it allows them to capitalize on wealthy patrons who are looking to travel in style during their time off.

In addition to the number of locations, their partnership program acts as a win-win-win scenario.

 Clients – Their clients benefit from the program because they get access to a wider selection of cars. If MPH Club was 100% reliant on their own inventory then it would be much harder to offer all of the rental options that they do. Additionally, the large supply of rental options means a more competitive price for clients.
 Car owners – The car owners benefit because they are able to turn their exotic car into an income-producing asset. Since many of these cars will rent for about $1,000 per day (the most expensive option is the Bugatti Veyron at $25,000 per day) just a few days of renting can create quite a bit of profit.
 MPH Club – MPH Club benefits from this arrangement because they are able to increase their inventory of cars without having to pay for it. Even though they split the profit with the car owner, they are essentially boosting their income for free.
Now accepting bitcoin

As mentioned, the MPH Club will now allow their clients to pay for their rentals in bitcoin. While they are not the first company to do this, it is still a big breakthrough for the cryptocurrency. A few major corporations such as Microsoft, Home Depot, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond allow their customers to pay in bitcoin. The difference here is that MPH Club is not a major corporation.

MPH Club operates on a much smaller scale than these companies and can be considered a mid-size corporation. They only operate in Florida and have a few locations throughout the state but they are far from a major corporation."

My question is, is it wiser to simply purchase BTC directly rather than pay a firm a premium to be exposed to their positions. What are the advantages/disadvantages of personal ownership versus the trust? Is the whole point of BTC to not have one neck to choke as investing through a firm would allow? What is to say they don’t close their positions with the trust suddenly due to other circumstances within their portfolio? I will most likely will be purchasing directly from CBPro and holding in my own personal wallet."

I was originally going to use CoinBase, but I'm having some trouble with their verification methods so I can't do it right now - in the semi-near future I plan on transferring the $5000 from the anonymous wallet to Coinbase so I can exchange it to PayPal, though.

My situation is a bit complicated regarding investing.

I was born in Germany, but have a US citizen parent, so I received both citizenships. This is great until you try investing as a regarded expat.

(it's also not just investing, you can apply this to taxes, applying for bank accounts and so on)

I've scoured the internet to find an exchange that accepts us citizens living in Germany (even tho I'm German as well), but still no luck.

2402,"Hello,

After weeks of trying to connect and verify my bank account so that I could purchase BTC via my Coinbase Pro account rather than as I do now via my debit card with Coinbase, I finally received a response from customer services...

Hello,

You have access to the following services from Coinbase:

-Credit card crypto buys
-Debit card crypto buys
-Crypto sells to PayPal (for more information, see this help article: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/adding-a-payment-method/paypal-faq)
-Crypto conversions (convert one crypto into another)
-Send crypto to a wallet outside of Coinbase (for more information, see this help article: https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/how-do-i-send-digital-currency-to-another-wallet.html)

You are not eligible to receive the following services on your account:

-Bank account deposits and withdrawals
-Cryptocurrency sells to fiat

This means that you're currently unable to sell your crypto for GBP or other fiat currency on Coinbase. However, you have the ability to sell crypto for fiat into your PayPal account.

Regards,
Coinbase Support

I have no idea why I’m not eligible for bank account deposits - I must be missing something but as I’ve given Coinbase too much time already while I’ve tried to find a resolution or more information, I think it’s time to find a more user friendly solution. 

Where would you recommend wise HODLers? I’m based in the UK.

Thank you."

Here's a quick run down, months ago paxful froze my account for no reason, I wasn't trading or anything.. My assets were just sitting there and that was my biggest mistake when these frauds decided to ban my account and asked me to give them proof that I am the owner of the account, so I immediately gave them my passport photo capture, my selfie and here's where this gets evil

Paxful would ask me to re-upload the very same thing again, and that happened for 4 consecutive times and that was on the month of October since this hideous game was played by paxful but after I called them up on this, they went silent.. Fast Forward 5 months later and I haven't heard anything from them, not a single reply from them since

I'm trying to find their phone number, address so I can sue them for everything they worth , 

For the users of paxful , please beware of the possibility of something like this to happen

Latest update (they're continuing to reject my passport and saying that it's manipulated.. I called them out on it by video capturing my passport from every page to leave no room for rejection and yet they still are holding on to my assets and torturing me to no end"

And on my Ledger Live I hit receive, and I did the usual process of putting in my address as you would normally do, and the 750 said that it went off. There was no more money left in the account. So after that I went to sleep. But this morning I went to check my balance to see that the money is not in my wallet yet. Is there any reason for this happening? I don't know how there is no money on the account but there is also no money on the wallet. I would appreciate some help. I have traded this way before and it worked.

     I am sure some of you are familiar with the BRRRR method of investing into real estate. Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. Here is a strategy for both leveraging Bitcoin to accumulate more and build a real estate portfolio as well. The last thing I would like to do is sell any of the bitcoin that I have, but thought of a scaleable way to acquire more bitcoin while building a real estate portfolio. You can use the quickness of BlockFi loans to beat out your traditional buyers or even cash buyers by being able to close on a property faster than anyone else allowing you to get better deals on the properties. This strategy allows you to never have to pay tax any of your Bitcoin other than the interest generated and allows you to scale a Bitcoin and realestate portfolio with other peoples money.
- [ ] Find flippable house
- [ ] Get blockfi loan 
- [ ] Rehab
- [ ] Increase value of home
- [ ] Refinance with traditional lender for value of home and a 30yr fixed mortgage
- [ ] Pay off blockfi loan
- [ ] Take all the equity you built from the cash out refinance and buy more Bitcoin
- [ ] Use monthly cash flow from property to buy more Bitcoin
- [ ] Rinse and repeat

-the income generated through rentals is tax advantaged and never pay tax on the increase in bitcoin while simultaneously increasing bitcoin position through the cash flow of the properties while also gaining equity in the property as well
-Only real tax is the interest from blockfi and whatever you are unable to write off on the real estate
-Earn income through interest on BlockFi
-Gain appreciation in home and Bitcoin


-when repair is needed or unexpected expense comes up use interest from blockfi or worst case take a loan and use cashflow to pay down

I understand that there is always the chance of getting margin called through a price drop, but I would mitigate that by having something liquid available to bring the LTV back to normal.

Any thoughts on how to improve this strategy or possible problems  you forsee would be great."

I,m looking for a team to create some sort of a decentralised crypto charity where it can maintain partnerships and promote donations on exchanges buy rounding to the closest dollar or any sort of fundraising tactics for that matter. i can imagine some sort of system where people in countries with crippling currencies can look for a new means of exchange peer to peer that will appreciate in value over time such as bitcoin and other crypto currencies. i imagine a system where money can be donated to a decentralised eco system and then the miners are in-charge of a distributing the crypto to people whom are in desperate need in which they must submit a thorougher application to be given a donation. its a wild idea because we need to trust that people will do the right thing and not just apply for this trust but maybe its the positive optimism that the world needs.

i can imagine this crypto charity to display public information on how bitcoin works and how it can change the world for the better. i also think this idea should be non for profit decentralised token of exchange that miners can earn an award for contributing to the system as well as to remain as natural as well this idea should promote online and offline cold wallet storing information and just basic information that every crypto currency holder should know when owning crypto.

5 years ago I had a friend who started mining BTC, he was constantly talking about the potencial of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, I didn't listen.

Instead, I decided to invest in another friend's business and I had just 500 USD. Where i'm from that means at least a month of surviving just for food. 

My friend's business didn't give any returns as it failed, in a situation where you need to sustain a business within a constantly declining economy and people getting shot in restaurants, it wasn't an easy task... So I cant blame my buddy.

Today, those 500 could be helping me move my parents and sister from my country to a better life and a new beginning, instead, i'm stuck with a shitty 9-5 hoping to one day at least raise enough BTC to get them out and get my second chance at life.

In Dec 2017, I bought some BTC and transferred it to another exchange where I converted it to TRX. This was all done on the same calendar day.

I never reported it for tax purposes because it didn't occur to me at the time that this was a taxable event, but I'm planning to do so this year as an amendment to that year's return.

I've spent hours trying to figure out if I had a gain or loss on the transaction, but since the purchase of the BTC, the transfer, and the conversion to TRX were all within a few hours of each other, I can't figure it out. The charts don't drill down to the hour.

Generally speaking, the price of BTC declined that day and was lower at the end of the day than it was at the start of the day. 

I've found general investment tax advice online that says that for traditional securities, if you can't figure out your costs for the investment, you can just estimate but that you should be prepared to explain yourself if you're audited.

I'm planning on saying that I made no gain or loss. Is this a fair strategy?

For context, the original BTC purchase was \~$2200 and I'm asking in relation to US taxes."

Taking into consideration the value of the U.S dollar and the fact that they're printing hundreds of millions of dollars (maybe billions?) per year..... I've been starting to feel like I bust my a$$ everyday for paper money that is feels from a technical standpoint to be worthless. How can it maintain value when prices are constantly increasing at disproportionate rates and with the gov printing tons of it at whenever they want???

I'm curious to know how many of you think that some form of digital currency will replace the U.S. dollar and other major currencies within our lifetime?

The technology is wild... It seems like we're well on our way to potentially just going primarily digital. We get paid direct deposit, use our debit cards at the store &amp; restaurants etc, and then we buy stuff online without even having to pull our cards out because it's all ready to go at the tap of a screen.

Lets say you see a significant price difference in an alt coin between the EU exchanges and the US exchanges and you want to take advantage of it. Say the same amount of the alt coin in EU is worth more in US so you want to transfer it across to US to sell. 

How do you work out if it's better to keep your profits in USD and transfer over to your bank account via Fiat exchange, or convert to Bitcoin and transfer back to a local exchange in Bitcoin? 

Are there any Bitcoin gas fee calculators that are easy to understand? I don't quite get the Satoshi thing or how to calculate it. I think from my research that you could just register with lots of global exchanges and potentially make some profits of global arbitrage trading if I could just work out the gas fee issue."

2463,"Back in November, when Bitcoin hit $18k, I was telling my friend """"SELL NOW! YOU HAVE TO SELL NOW!""""

His response was that he wasn't selling because he was expecting Bitcoin to hit $50k. He bought 2 BTC back when it was around $4k in 2017.

I told him I didn't believe Bitcoin would EVER go to $50k, so it was better to cash out now before it crashed down hard like it did in 2018.

You see, the first time I heard about Bitcoin was in 2017 with all the crazy news about cryptocurrencies in general. I have a degree in Computer Science so it was easy for me to understand the technology. I thought it was awesome.

But back then, I was in it """"for the money"""". I started researching different cryptos and trying to figure out which one was going to make me the most money.

I remember buying a lot of Verge (XVG). It was the most hyped up crypto back then. People were talking about the release of Wraith Protocol. Supposedly the price was going to go to """"the moon"""" after the announcement of this new revolutionary protocol.

My dad bought some cryptos (Ethereum and IOTA). My mom wanted some as well (Monero and Cardano).

It was the first time we experienced a market bubble. Complete and total newbies. We got sucked into it.

I had a lot of shitcoins that crashed hard. I also had a Binance account that ended up being locked because I lost my 2FA app and was never able to get back in.

I felt like a fool.

I figured that while the idea behind cryptocurrencies was great, the market was simply pumps and dumps. I said to myself """"Lesson learned"""" and moved on.

Enter COVID-19.

This is what changed everything for me. 

I've NEVER been political in my life, but after my country's government started to close down businesses and lock people inside their homes, something inside me awakened.

I'm from Costa Rica and it has always been a beautiful country, but for the past 10 years or so the economy has been going downhill hard. Everything is becoming more and more expensive. The fiscal deficit is shooting up and the only solution these """"genius"""" politicians can come up with is to raise taxes and borrow money from the IMF.

So when COVID-19 hit and the government decided to fuck up everything EVEN MORE than what it was, I had enough.

That's the moment I realized that most of my political beliefs are libertarian. A whole new world opened up for me. I was in shock to see how most people in social media expect the government to solve all problems in the country. They're all brainwashed.

I'm not anarcho-capitalist. I do think the state is needed in the same way a condominium management is needed. But I have serious issues with the government trying to """"control"""" and """"regulate"""" everything. The world would be a MUCH BETTER PLACE if governments were limited to simply protect us from criminals, build roads and provide a little help here and there.

My country has universal health care and I'm totally fine with it, works pretty well. But that's another topic.

So back to Bitcoin.

I mentioned that when it hit $18k I told my friend to sell. That's because, despite my new discovered political views, I still believed that it would never go higher than that.

But then it hit $20k.

And then $25k.

And then $30k.

And that was the turning point for me.

Bitcoin had officially """"passed the test"""".

It proved me wrong.

There is actually a chance it can succeed!

I cannot begin to explain how everything just clicked for me. I now have an opportunity to have my own money under my control. I can now be a part of a revolution. I can support the cause: Separation of money and state.

Bitcoin gives the power back to the people, the way it should be.

And I haven't even talked about banks.

Think about this: If you have 1 million dollars and you want to send that money to a friend in another city or country, why do you have to ask for """"permission"""", answer questions, provide documentation or go through a bunch of hoops?

It's your freaking money! It's yours to do whatever you want with it.

What about the countless maneuvers and shenanigans that banks do with your money? 

In my country most people earn less than what they need so they all use credit cards like mad. They are slaves to debt and so, slaves to the banks.

So as you can see, my reason for investing in Bitcoin is ideological.

I'm not in it """"for the money"""". The price could stay the same for all I care. Having control of my money is good enough for me.

By the way, my friend was 100% in it for the money. He's now selling his bitcoin because his price goal was $50k.

Guess who's buying from him?

Searching my Bitcoin address for the exchange, I see 0.025 BTC was also withdrawn. I cannot tell where I sent the BTC though because I'm not familiar with the BTC explorer.

2475,"I am still in my teens and even though I've been dolar cost averaging the dips for the past 4 months on crypto I still have more money than I need on the bank account doing absolutely nothing except each year having less accusation power.

At first I started with small investment and plenty of fear but I have learned more I have became more secure of my investments and i feel more comfortable putting larger amounts and not panicking during dips.

So my question is should I put more money into it or is it taking too much risk. How should my risk be taking into account that I'm very young and I do not have large amounts of money. Is in this case a risky take on something you believe in after DYOR worth it? 

In any case I'm not thinking of going all in but I'm thinking of maybe putting out to 50% of my wealth into crypto. Since I don't have much too lose and I am winning money from my job.

I have seen on my own eyes how some of my picks had 3x which blew my mind. And I realized that investing in crypto if done well can be life-changing. That is my end goal to go from nothing that is what I have to being financially comfortable and free.

Each day that passes by I am more bullish on crypto and my body craves to out more into it. But I have the fear of blowing it up.

My questions are:

So what are your thoughts? Should I take the risk, should I be conservative?

And what percentage did you put and you currently have on crypto?

What to do if crypto becomes the biggest part of your net worth?

Ps: Sorry for any grammar mistake English isn't my first language."
2476,"I could help but notice how the 5 Laws of Gold from the book """"The Richest Man in Babylon"""" can be directly applied to Bitcoin.

1. “Bitcoin cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.”

2. “Bitcoin laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for its profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.”

3. “Bitcoin clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.”

4. “Bitcoin slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.”

5. “Bitcoin flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.”

I am currently a hodler who has a significant portion of my savings in Bitcoin and look forward to both its increased value and widespread adoption over time.  I am not by any means a no coiner or someone who is here to promote FUD.

However there seems to be very conflicting narratives concerning the emissions produced by the Bitcoin network and I'm hoping that we might be able to cut through the noise and once and for all figure this out as a community because I see the carbon footprint issue as the greatest existential threat to Bitcoin's success over the long run, so hopefully there are plans to address this. 

Oh and one thing that never seems to get mentioned in this debate is the environmental impact caused by mining gold or silver.... just saying.

I look forward to seeing everyone's thoughts on the matter.

Thank you :)"
2482,"I've been invested since 2011 and the one thing I've learned is in all bubbles a majority of the gains are made at the very end of the cycle.  Trying to guess the top is a fools bet as being wrong by a couple weeks can cost you all your gains.  Sure Bitcoin eventually fell to as low as 3k but even getting the top right by with a 12 day window is near impossible.

Don't treat investments as a get rich quick scheme, the true winners are those who diamond hands hold for decades.  When it's your time to retire you can spend your coins just like you would dollars you cashed out."
2483,"April has traditionally been a very very good month for bitcoin. Here are the growth percentage since bitcoin’s inception.

2014 - (-)1.4%

2015 - (-)3.4%

2019 - 28.6%

2020 - 34.5%

2021 -

I understand I'd probably need:

* Note / Coin Reader

We are getting mislead perhaps by false image positioning of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. 

So, what's Bitcoin then? 
It's a perfect form of programmable money or a decentralized financial system. On top of this, Bitcoin is the best example of """"store of value."""" Perhaps, the rhetoric should move to Bitcoin instead of gold. 
What's the growth? Something that clicks my mind. 

An unprecedented and dominating track record nevertheless. 
Bitcoin, 48,25,525% of growth in the last one decade. Gold, dwarfed by the shine of the golden-bit-goose at 900%. 

Best time to make gold bugs question their move now."
2493,"I see a lot of people comparing BTC to gold and in how we could compare BTC's value to gold's value as a store of wealth.  

This is inherently flawed.  A vast majority of people who own phones and could potentially have a crypto wallet **do not in any shape or form have the ability to invest in gold.**  

Gold also has almost no purchasing power.  I know we've heard this one before but no one carries around quantities of gold that can actually pay for things easily.  Sure I can go into Best Buy and offer the cashier my Rolex(TM) for the Vizio TV I'm buying but they most likely won't even consider taking the deal.

BTC/Crypto will overtake Gold as a store of wealth.  Full stop. **It is infinitely better at doing this and more.**

I truly see the value of bitcoin and that it will eventually eat central banks and the financial system. However, I don't think there is anything wrong with taking profits. 

We are all people who have needs such as real estate, a wedding, a car(not a lambo), etc. Don't beat yourself up if you need to cash out to buy a necessity or think there will be a dip. I do feel that there will be a mania in the market and eventually a blow off top. 

In this case, instead of looking at gains lost, you could wait patiently and buy at a 50% or 60% discount so you can buy more bitcoin. I will likely buy more bitcoin once it corrects next year or sometime in the future.

Don't let anyone convince you that things go up forever."

We aren’t just talking about a pizza here either, the fact people are willing to trade something like a house for Bitcoin is huge for its adoption.

Hi guys, it was almost the same than last week.

Around 4,000,000 USD in weekly trades.

This is only measured using LocalBitcoin as they publish they weekly date, since months ago Binance opened P2P trade with Bolivares, I suspect a lot of people are moving to Binance.

There are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They need to do something else to survive.

I think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to """"live"""".

On a personal note, I got COVID, I did think it was just a flu but days ago I lost my taste and smell. Here there is no easy way of getting PCR test and there is not nationwide vaccine plan, goverment says """"f\*ck you, save yourself you are in our own"""". I'm resting and I hope I didn't infect people close (like my parents :().

I spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins, acetaminophen and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS have helped me a lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon :()

One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP
* 19 DOGE
* 0.2 NANO

Disclaimer: Even when MOONS are nice and have helped me a lot, I don't post these updates for that (Moon-farming) I have been doing that for years a long time ago before MOONS where a thing.

Aid to $ 53,000 has been made in the past few years. In the night from Monday to Tuesday, the correction movement in Bitcoin came to an end at exactly this level. So this brand gilds as heard from my perspective. My insight: A slide under $ 53,000 makes the light of confidence jump from green to yellow. Then it causes the downward movement to expand to around $ 50,000. Among them, there is a risk of falling to around 41,000 US dollars.

The CIA operates two wallets. The public key's are known to the operator in a hostile country. In stead of listening to a radio the operator uses a blockchain explorer to watch for transactions. The CIA sends x amount of sats from one address to another that is also in their hands. The number of sats is the code, the OTP encrypted message. The transaction is out in the open, the random noise is created by all the other users. The use of such an explorer creates plausible denyability.
It could also be used the other way around for the operator to communicate back home, removing the need for a handler, or at least lower the amount of physical meet ups. The latter has some problems of course. Using bitcoin is pseudonymous and when the operator moves sats from one wallet to another (both in his possesion) can be explained, but does lower the possibility of plausible denyability.
Another option is the CIA and offshore operator communicating directly by using different amounts of sats. Say amount X means do Y and sending back X -1 sats means succes, X -2 means no succes.

**MIND THE MONDAY MORNING MINER'S GAP UP**

*A Warning about Bitcoin, Fossil Fuel Power Generation, and a Looming Regulatory Hammer*

On the morning of Monday, March 22 North American stock traders woke up to find a remarkable runner on their pre-market scans. The stock of[ Support.com, a relatively unknown and financially-challenged, internet-based technical support services firm, had rocketed from a mere $2.14/share close on Friday to a whopping $7.97 at Monday open](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/support-com-stock-skyrockets-after-merger-deal-with-bitcoin-mining-company-11616425018?siteid=yhoof2) and in the first 30 minutes of trading exploded even further topping out at $9.45 before beginning its descent to end the week at $4.78.

What was all the excitement about?[ Having lost one of its biggest customers in 2020](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/SPRT/pressreleases/578996/), Support.com appeared to be struggling, and so in what could be seen as a Hail Mary pass for shareholder value, they merged with bitcoin miner/power generator Greenidge Generation. It is an unusual marriage out of which Greenidge gains an easy, lesser scrutinized path to the public markets and Support.com shareholders gain an exit or stock value resuscitation. Daytraders and longtime Support.com shareholders got to make some money, and Greenidge got to list on the NASDAQ the easy way. So, what's the problem? Well...

Greenidge Generation is located in upstate New York in a previously decommissioned coal-fired power plant along the western shores of Lake Seneca. In 2014, the plant was purchased by wood products, metals, and power generation giant Atlas Holdings who converted the plant from coal to natural gas generation in 2017. Noting that any contribution the plant might make to the grid would be largely redundant, Atlas-owned Greenidge began selling their excess fossil-fueled capacity to[ institutional bitcoin mining interests](https://www.coindesk.com/new-york-power-plant-greenidge-has-sold-up-to-30-of-its-bitcoin-mining-hash-rate). And this is where the problem begins. What it portends is not just a climate catastrophe and a significant loophole in upcoming US climate legislation, but the looming threat of firm regulatory action.

**Beware Gaping Holes in Climate Action Plans**

In April,[ the Biden administration is expected to table a $3 trillion set of infrastructure bills](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/biden-infrastructure-spending.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap) targeted at fighting climate change. Unlike Obama, who focused his agenda on regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants,[ “Biden’s priority is to pour money into new technologies and clean energy hardware.”](https://qz.com/1987869/joe-bidens-new-infrastructure-bill-is-all-about-climate-change/) Over the next 5 to 10 years, as the United States greens it’s grid, companies that own legacy fossil fuel power plants will be looking for an exit. This includes companies like Atlas Holdings who own over 1 GigaWatt of oil and coal-fired capacity through its New Hampshire-based subsidiary,[ Granite Shore Power](https://www.graniteshorepower.com/). And, as suggested in their[ merger webcast](https://corporate.support.com/about-us/investor-relations/), in the wake of the Greenidge + Support.com merger,[ they plan to expand their current 20MW of bitcoin dedicated power generation capacity to 500MW by 2025.](https://corporate.support.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Greenidge-SPRT-Merger-Announcement-032221-FINAL.pdf) This plan includes purchasing more power plants--with no commitment to renewables. In greenhouse gas emissions terms this is dangerous, really, really dangerous and is bound to catch the attention of regulators if not immediately then in the very near future.

According to Alex De Vries, of the Digiconomist, producer of the[ Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) (BECI),[ at its current rate of power consumption bitcoin will exceed the CO2 emissions of global gold mining](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally) which currently stand at[ 81million metric tons](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mining-gold-emissions-idUKKBN2832ZN) per annum. Given that bitcoin achieved these emissions levels even before companies like[ Tesla announced that they will accept bitcoin](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/business/elon-musk-tesla-bitcoin.html) as payment for goods in the mainstream economy, the prospects are a climate disaster. To put this in greater focus, according to the BECI, the production of one bitcoin emits the same amount of CO2 as 854,059 Visa transactions or 385.35kg. Bitcoin currently ranks[ equivalent to the 36th top-energy-consuming country in the world](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption), consuming about as much power as Belgium or the Philippines, or 89.33TWH/year. If it becomes[ a mainstream currency as well as a store of value](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-transaction-volume-to-beat-internet/), it could cause a colossal global energy crisis. The rolling blackouts that[ recently struck Abkhazia](https://news.trust.org/item/20210301081901-rehi0) may just be the canary in the bitcoin mine. 

I doubt energy or securities regulators in the US or other advanced economies are interested in having bitcoin mine triggered power grid meltdowns under their watch. As we know,[ Fed Chair Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have longstanding concerns about bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/01/fed-governor-powell-is-watching-bitcoin-closely.html), and now with climate hawks in the Biden administration it is highly likely that regulation will strike sooner rather than later.

Local authorities from[ Inner Mongolia](https://decrypt.co/59811/inner-mongolia-to-ban-bitcoin-mining-what-it-means-for-the-industry) to[ Missoula County, Montana](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoins-climate-impact-global-cures-local/) are already taking action banning bitcoin mining that directly or indirectly contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Bitcoin has also caught the attention of the likes of[ John Kerry](https://www.coindesk.com/the-us-can-make-bitcoin-mining-greener), the US's chief climate negotiator. With the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's COP26 conference slated to take place in Glasgow this coming November, and rising concerns with bitcoin's carbon footprint crypto currency could become the target of global climate treaty negotiators.

On the market side, if federal regulators don't take immediate action, activist investors may be the ones to sound alarm bells and if miners don't listen, then, similar to how the[ Security and Exchanges Commission directed Occidental Petroleum and Connoco Phillips to take action on shareholder emissions target initiatives](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-conocophillips-occidental-sec-idUSKBN2BC0QE), shareholders will likely be backed up in their demand that miners end using fossil fuel to power their activities.

So, where do we traders go from here?[ Kevin O’Leary recently made his position clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eCUUK8XRGo&amp;t=1775s) and I think it is insightful. Pointing to[ ethically and ecologically questionionable mining activities in China](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-mining-in-xinjiang-china-could-be-a-red-flag-for-regulators-51613764881), he thinks the regulatory hammer is going to come down soon. And so rather than invest in bitcoin willy nilly he aims to place his 3% bitcoin allocation with miners who can authenticate that their coin was mined in an ethical and ecologically sustainable manner, thereby sheltering it from the coming regulatory threat. These could include players like Canadian hydro powered bitcoin miner Bitfarms ([interesting CEO interview from minute 12](https://www.coindesk.com/tv/all-about-bitcoin/all-about-bitcion-mar-23-2021-20210322)), or participants in certification regimes like the newly minted[ Terra Pool initiative](https://money.tmx.com/en/quote/su/news/7259961200592195/UPDATE:_DMG_Blockchain_Solutions_and_Argo_Blockchain_to_Launch_the_First_Clean_Energy_Bitcoin_Mining_Pool). Raw, and very real climate concerns aside, I agree with O’Leary here and in my opinion, environmental regulation is coming soon to a bitcoin near you, so I would say, take note, take action and invest wisely."

You will probably hate me for this, but I think it is worth sharing... Do you remember when kingblue\_xrp used a charity bot to donate XRP to Saint Judes children hospital? Well if you do not remember or did not know that, here is the article. [ST. JUDES XRP DONATION](https://www.tokens24.com/news/st-jude-childrens-research-hospital-received-more-than-21000-xrp-in-the-form-of-donation)

Now, I am a huge supporter of efforts that donate to cancer patients and their causes. I know this is a bitcoin forum, and everyone here is smart and focuses on highly researched utility coins, but please check this out.

There is a coin called """"GRUMPEE"""" (I know stupid name), that is following in the footsteps of XRP. I think they only went with the meme reference to help market but anyways please keep reading. They have a wallet that receives .3% of all transactions through smart contract. Every amount of coins in this wallet gets sent directly to causes to help child cancer. This is truly inspirational in my opinion. I wish more of the big players would throw things in their development like this. Imagine the donation you could get after a month of bitcoin transactions at .3%. I am probably missing something huge here, but I am mostly just angered by how much a coin like bitcoin could produce with this.

2556," Hello everyone, I've been creating a cryptocurrency using Golang for the past 6 months. So far, I've created a blockchain based on the bitcoin source code, books, and online tutorials, and I'm currently working on a peer to peer network. Basically, the network uses TCP and RPCs to send data (the data is serialized using the Gob package) and nodes have the ability to send one another their respective version of the blockchain, update it as needed, send transactions, send blocks, etc... As for node discovery, much akin to Bitcoin, I have designed a DNS server which crawls the network, finding active nodes and adding them to a set. When a new node joins the network, it simply sends a request to the DNS which in turn returns a random node from the set for it to connect to. I also built a frontend application using Angularjs which allows users to interact with the blockchain (buy and send coins). This frontend application communicates with the Golang cryptocurrency using an API that is built into the blockchain.

With the technical stuff out of the way, the gist of my cryptocurrency is to create a digital version of the dollar. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, my coin, also known as a """"stablecoin"""", has a fixed value. Up to this point, I've been working on this project entirely by myself and I do not have any contacts within the field of cryptocurrencies. I'm very serious about this project and it would be great to get some guidance from people who are involved in the industry and who have perhaps gone through the same process as me. How would I go about launching a cryptocurrency like this one? (What security checks need to be performed? Are there any potential legal issues I should be worried about? How do I get people to run nodes? How do I advertise my cryptocurrency? etc...).

What can we do besides email them simultaneously and demand access to our coin or liquidate our assets and move on?
2563,"I just saw a video stating that if a """"tainted"""" bitcoin is used to trade, it can cause your account to be locked from Coinbase for example. My question:

Let's say you have exactly 1 BTC, and you send your friend Bob 0.0002 BTC for the pizza he's bringing with him. Now I still have the rest of the BTC (0.999...) in my wallet. Does Bob's 0.0002 BTC and my 0.999.. still identify as the one original BTC but just marked as a part of the original or is it split to two new hashes with our public keys or what exactly happens there?

Thank you."
2564,"Hi. I want to withdraw funds from NiceHash to Binance which requires me a BTC on-chain transaction, but the minimum withdrawable amount is 0.001 BTC that I don't have. My plan is to withdraw to Breez Wallet via Lightning and from there to make the transaction, but the wallet doesn't allow you to see what are the fees without having money in it.  Can anyone who has satoshis in their wallet tell me what are the fees for on-chain transactions?
I'm doing this because there is a task on Binance that has a countdown and I don't wanna miss it."
2565,I’m new to bitcoin but have read the s2f model and am very bullish. Is Coinbase a safe place to store funds? What is a cold wallet and how would I transfer funds to a cold wallet?
2566,"Why?

Because the US Government IS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO (big surprise!), and has at least 5% of all Bitcoins available, that is 1,000,000 Bitcoins.

For a start, Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) -256 is the hash function and [**mining**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mining) algorithm of the Bitcoin [**protocol**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/protocol), referring to the cryptographic hash function that outputs a 256 bits long value. The algorithm is a variant of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). and NO Satoshi is obviously NOT Japanese, because is he/she was Jap then this whole thing would have started in Japan.

It is the SAME GAME they are playing when the US Government dumped the Bretton Wood system in 1972 after having secured most of the gold in the US Government vault. Now they are doing that last stretch where they print, print and print more USD fiat to scoop up as much hard assets for the last time. and then BOOM they announce they actually have the biggest Bitcoin horde on the planet.

If they had started off by saying: """"Hey guys we the NSA and the US Treasuries and the FED have worked together to create a new currency called - Bitcoin! Let's mine it and use it but we have already got a headstart and hold 5% of it"""" then everyone's reaction would have been like """"f off""""

Hence not only would the US Government NOT ban Bitcoin, they are allowing all these private crypto companies like Coinbase, Paypal, Square and crypto ETFs and crypto Hedge Funds in the US to blossom because they would want the crypto industry to be US centric just like how the world is USD centric for the past 50 years. Elon Musk, Jack Dorssey, Dan Bilzerian, Cathie Wood, all see this they just buy and buy with a price target but they MUST have already figured it out.

This whole thing is a government project to begin with, I mean really which common civilian has the resource to develop and deploy something like this - most of the people don't even understand fiat money, leave alone developing Bitcoin.

This is actually MEGA GOOD NEWS for Bitcoin, as we have got the government the strongest country in the world backing it, because it is the same government which created it 13 years ago!

My personal estimate is each Bitcoin will get to $2.5 million USD (I will provide breakdown in another post).

HODL to $2,500,000 USD !!!"
2567,"So my brother is trying to get into his coinbase account as he had some crypto bought a year or so ago. However he has been locked out of his email address AND no longer has the phone number for his 2FA.

2571,"I've an idea for a startup: the digital Bitcoin wallet for blind people. I'll be glad to form a team to develop this project. I've good connections with the mainstream (The Daily Telegraph, New-York Times etc.) and crypto media to push this project and secure an awareness about him + social media (SMM, SEO). As a professional Finance consultant and professor of Corporate Finance I've developed a business-model to secure that the project will break even.

I think the project needs a developer to create maybe on the already existing code the basic digital wallet. The new will be the voice identification of the user, the voice management of the digital wallet and the service of voice advertising. Possible investors and supporters of this socially important project are welcome, you can send me a direct message.

2574,"I am kind of new in this crypto world. I hold most of my BTC in a cold wallet, but I also allocated a reduced portion into a US centralized lending platform (eg BlockFi, Gemini, etc.) in order to earn some interest over time. I am considering to deposit more BTC into this lending platform.

I know, I know: not your keys not your BTC. This is why this increase would continue being small vis a vis my entire portfolio. 

However, I am not sure if this increase would be advisable right now considering that the US government will release soon (likely on April) a tax reform that might impact directly to the crypto world; and since, this centralized platform is located in the US, it is likely that it may affect my portfolio and future yieldings. 

Have you heard something on this matter that should prevent me to increase my portfolio at this moment? Is there anything else I should consider?

2575,"I know that reusing BTC addresses has privacy risks, but I am focusing only on security risks with this post.

I have read that receiving BTC to an address that has previously sent is a security risk. I think it may have something to do with quantum computers. So for example the following workflow could be vulnerable:

* Receive BTC at address A
* Spend BTC from address A
* Receive more BTC at address A

But what if an address has received multiple times but has never sent any BTC? Is this also vulnerable, or is it safe? So for example:

* Receive BTC at address B
* Receive more BTC at address B"
2576,"Recently I have seen the quote: “Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” being shared and talked about here and other corners of the internet.

SN has shown to have mined 1,125,150btc, as well as other rumors that he lost hundreds of thousands to hard drive failure.

I have been thinking about the idea that SN intentionally lost the majority or of all of their bitcoin to contribute to this idea of it being a donation to others.

If this assumption is actually true, it just goes to show how much SN believed in bitcoin and willing to give up what could potentially be the greatest single fortune in history to help the adoption of his greater vision."
2577,"Why Nations Fail looks to answer the questions, ‘Why are some nations rich and others poor? And how do some nations end up prosperous and tolerant, while others sink into elite despotism and self-interested greed?’. As these questions were answered throughout the book, I couldn’t help but notice the glaringly obvious connection they had to Bitcoin. By looking at the central argument of the book, I believe a general rule of thumb can be applied to better understand which countries will look to regulate Bitcoin and to what extent. 

The book argues that the answer to the above questions are simple: a given country’s prosperity is determined by its economic institutional landscape: the systems and regulations that direct economic behaviour within its borders. That landscape includes property laws, the strength of public services and access to finance. These economic institutions fall into one of two categories: extractive or inclusive. 

Inclusive economic institutions stimulate economic success and are designed to encourage participation in economic activities. They also nurture economic freedom. In countries like the USA and South Korea for instance, market rules derive from private property laws, as well as from developed banking sectors and strong public education systems. These rules enable people to know they can work hard and be innovative, certain that their efforts will be remunerated and their wealth will be preserved. 

In contrast, extractive institutions derive incomes from the majority within society for the benefit of a minority group of elites. In North Korea, the Kim family founded a regime that repressed the populace, outlawed private property and concentrated all power within a select elite. Similarly, Latin America, a system built on duress and expropriation of indigenous populations was designed to benefit the colonisers.

Historically, inclusive institutions have been hugely prosperous for everyone in society. Whereas extractive institutions, without fail, have led to the rapid downfall of societies. For example, the devastation caused by the ‘Black Death’, allowed Western Europe to lay the foundations for inclusive institutions, whereas Eastern Europe largely became a more extractive institution. Such foundations ultimately allowed Western Europe, in particular England, to reap the rewards of the industrial revolution. Whereas most of Easter Europe stagnated, benefiting little from the enormous growth their neighbours experienced.

Further to this, the book hypothesis that Inclusive societies embrace technological innovation, recognising it will benefit the majority.  Whereas extractive societies suppress technological innovation as it challenges their supremacy through the enrichment of its adopters. Technological innovation makes human societies prosperous but also involves the replacement of the old with the new and the destruction of the economic privileges and political power of certain people. For example, Austria in the 18th century prohibited all new machinery and railways. Fearing that new technologies would enable revolution. Due to this fear of the industrial revolution and associated creative destruction, Austria’s development floundered significantly.

Bitcoin (and blockchain more generally) is a technology that threatens to challenge the existing establishment in countries throughout the world; looking to replace the old with the new. The ultimate form of creative destruction. Whether that is replacing traditional assets, commodities, stores of values and mediums of exchange - or replacing the central role of banks and more generally incumbent organisations and institutions with fairer and more inclusive systems. The list of opportunities for blockchain and creative destruction is endless. The technology is here and it is not going anywhere. So, the question is, which nations will look to regulate and to what extent? 

After reading ‘Why Nations Fail’, two things became obvious. Firstly, extractive institutions will look to significantly regulate Bitcoin and blockchain as it poses an existential threat to their hold on power and wealth. Whereas inclusive institutions will impose minimal regulation as they recognise the technology will likely stimulate economic growth and prosperity for all. Secondly, nations that impose overly strict regulation will permanently hinder growth whereas nations that impose minimal regulation will reap the rewards. Two relatively obvious points. 

However, I believe both points should offer people a certain degree of comfort and reassurance in regards to the future of regulation. If we use the (potentially overly) simple rule of thumb: extractive = strong regulation and inclusive = minimal regulation, we can begin to try to understand and navigate the potential minefield of regulation. Examples of some large extractive institutions are: China, Russia, Nigeria (and many other African nations) and large parts of the Middle East. Inclusive institutions include the UK, Germany, France, Switzerland, the USA and Canada just to name a few.

Until recently, I believed that strict regulation, for many of the nations listed in the inclusive category, was just around the corner. However, after reading ‘Why Nations Fail’ I have been left feeling far more optimistic for these nations that are built on inclusive systems. Yes, there are significant fundamental problems with many of the nations and their institutions listed. Nonetheless, ultimately they have all been founded in and moulded by the principles of inclusive systems. A fact I believe will ultimately lead to limited regulation implemented by the countries listed and as a result; greater prosperity and growth for everyone included."

2580," Hi guys, it was almost the same than last week.

Around 4,000,000 USD in weekly trades.

This  is only measured using LocalBitcoin as they publish they weekly date,  since months ago Binance opened P2P trade with Bolivares, I suspect a  lot of people are moving to Binance.

There  are other exchanges like AirTM and UPHOLD and even some local ones  (with maybe the goverment behind) like Amberescoin and Cryptia.

A  big part of the population that work for the goverment have a wage of  between 1 and maybe 10 monthly minimum wages, yes, that is true. They  need to do something else to survive.

I  think average wage is like 10-15 USD weekly, which is much better but  still not enough. A family needs at least 300USD monthly to """"live"""".

On  a personal note, I got COVID, I did think it was just a flu but days  ago I lost my taste and smell. Here there is no easy way of getting PCR  test and there is not nationwide vaccine plan, goverment says """"f\*ck you,  save yourself you are in our own"""". I'm resting and I hope I didn't  infect people close (like my parents :().

I  spend around 40 USD purchasing some medicines (vitamins,  acetaminophen   and so on) and just to treat it like a flu. MOONS (cryptocurrency points) have helped me a  lot, even with these expenses (I have to cash out the ones I have soon  :()

One monthly minimum wage (1 USD) is around:

* 1800 satoshis
* 17 MOONS
* 1.8 XRP
* 19 DOGE
* 0.2 NANO

However when/if I do I have some concerns about reporting crypto taxes.

I've also received sats as payments, reimbursements and as gifts. This has been going on for years and I simply have no record of these transactions.

I've also had so many different wallets I feel that it's impossible to prove where every transaction has come and gone from.

However, I do keep track in my own accounting software how much money I've directly contributed into buying bitcoin. It of course doesn't take into account fees, but for what it's worth I have a very rough cost basis for my entire wallet.

Then I answered that email and no answer so far. I then filled another ticket explaining that error and also explaining those steps that I did to be sure they won't give me the same answer. No answer and then I wrote another one and rated them negatively. On that ticket, I got also some braindead answer like I was some kind of moron that is using the internet for the first time. They asked me am I sure I am trying to send the money from the right wallet. I have only one active wallet and that is the only wallet I was ever using without problem.

I am running in the circles at this point, there is no support from them, just some random stupid answers.

2602,"Fellow Bitcoiners,

I came across this short idea that BTC is driving the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Sound controversial? It is, but let me try to explain...

This comes back to the concept of what a battery is: """"if you can translate electricity into something that can be used anywhere at any time, then you have a battery""""

Crypto mining converts electricity into value in the form of coins, which can be moved, exchanged, or HODLd. If we think of Bitcoin as a battery, the possible applications are varied and exciting.

Now of course it does not change the fact that it would be best if BTC was only mined through either excess energy in the grid or fully renewable energy, but maybe we'll get there at some point.

Just found it interesting as food for thought!

Or kill then exchanges???*

Let me say it clear: most of you cyber noobs have no effing idea what cryptography, decentralized networks like the torrent network, and ultimately crypto currency are capable of.

You're thinking in legacy system terms. You're thinking, """"Oh no the economic value of my coins can go down because they control the exchanges"""". You don't get it.

But it's way bigger thank what your frightened, conditioned, slave mentality brain can even start to grasp.

What crypto does, among other things:
* it doesn't care what your exchange rate is
* it doesn't care how good your on and off ramps are
* it doesn't care about your local law
* it doesn't care about censorship

I'm so happy that the success of this project does not depend on whether people's feelings are aligned with the cryptographic reality of it.

2614," What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a protocol that aims to achieve consensus of strangers in a value exchange. It achieves this task by making sure everyone in the network is on the same page or “block”. While the Blockchain is just a long book with all transactions ever taken on the network, what makes Bitcoin the genius invention is the understanding of human nature. To make sure everyone plays by the rules, it makes cheating ether A. Not as profitable as playing by the rules or B. So expensive in form of raw force needed that it is just not worth it.

Having understood the fundamentals is key to see why proof of stake will (yet) not work in the short term, or at least on the same scale as PoW.

While most people argue that the energy consumption is the key factor of why proof of stake is necessary, it ignores the main driving force in human wealth accumulation: Greed.

It should be considered that Bitcoin digitalized our need for automatic consensus in an exchange, while at the same time triggering pretty much all primal impulses.

What the Chyperpunk movement understood is:

Humans are lazy (Automatic Consensus, everyone can mine)

Humans are greedy (Automatic difficulty scaling that is key to security)

Humans want everything now (Instant gratification in mining)

Humans try everything to cheat the system for own gain (Unprofitable to cheat)

Humans blame others (“Inventor” Vanished, Bitcoin is self-sustaining and cannot be stopped)

Human nature

While most of first world inhabitants take their surroundings for granted and mostly ignore the problems of others, nearly 22% of all living humans are in Poverty. 35-40% do not have a Bank account or access to the banking system. A lot of smarter people than me got into this problem on why we willingly destroy the planet and abusing and using others directly or indirectly with our actions but you can boil it down to one thing: Greed. As one of the seven vices in culture and literature, it perfectly fits into why we are what we are. Tracing the start of a commodity to the end of production, you will almost always find a human right violation until it is on your table. While this is a known fact, not many people really care about it: “That’s how the system works.”. How could they care in the tangle of life? This fact is woven into the protocol. While i highly doubt the inventors are too stupid to understand the consequence of mining, it is catered to our nature. In some terms – criticizing mining is criticizing human nature. This critic is of course necessary, but will only take roots in a long time span. One of the main drivers on why we don’t burn ourself on the stake anymore, at least here, is this critique over time but I would argue that most of it has to do with a. Making things easy AND friendly to humans / nature b. Education.

While things get better over time, the proof lies in itself because we are still here, ultimately it is foolish to believe that people will change in one or two or three generations. 

Greed

While greed is only one of the vices, it fits very good into why Bitcoin is so successful. Not only counters it our will to betray anyone for more, the protocol itself has a fail-save for our own broad term stupidity. While there is no Human that distributes coins, the main problem is solved. With making it unprofitable or less profitable to cheat the system, the second problem is solved. 

The simple genius solution to greed is: No Human distributor. 

Now proof of stake does the same, but:

PoW also caters to something more. Anyone can put muscle into it. Anyone can “physicly” participate. Its not a random number or lottery where you put money in and hope for better odds and more money. It is actual work that can be made and seen. Now you can build the smartest PoS system but I will bet anything it will not get the same participation in the short term as the Bitcoin network has.

It caters to more vices.

Future

While I genuinely believe that bitcoin is one of the greatest invention with the internet (and many more) to bring humans away from destroying themselves, I also have my problems with the energy consumption. In the long term I can see banking swallowed and all smaller jobs in Finance/Archiving/Proofing that are not programming the system will be gone. We will invent chips that use less energy and go away from anything that is not sustainable. At least in the first and second world countries. You cannot expect anything from anyone that has problems putting food on the table or has no clean water.

In the short term we will choose the system that caters best to our vices.

In the long term we will use those systems to save us all.

2616,"RBF (replace-by-fee) is Bitcoin's feature, which lets you send the same transaction (double-spend) with a higher fee. The great thing about RBF is that you can send the second transaction to a different address, effectively cancelling the original transaction.

Yesterday, I fucked up by sending 20x intended size transaction using a Bitcoin Core client. Luckily, the RBF was enabled for the transaction. Unluckily, Bitcoin Core can only bump up the fee and cannot double-spend to cancel the transaction. So I had to install Electrum, dump my wallet with Bitcoin Core, import the private keys to Electrum, and then double-spend to cancel the transaction from Electrum. Thanks to the low fee I set for the original transaction and the current size of the mempool, I had enough time to do all this and save my money.

So, the moral of the story: 

1. Double-check the transaction amount before sending.
2. Enable RBF for all your transactions.
3. Don't set too high fees on your transactions.
4. If you fuck up your transaction, it can still be saved if you act quickly enough."

2624,"Hi all,

I'm looking for a kindergarten way of explaining how coins/tokens are owned (in reality) while in an exchange account or wallet.  From what I understand, while in an exchange the actual crytpo is in somewhat of an ocean of mass ownership (within the exchange) and it's only actually """"in your possession"""" if you use your seed phrase/key to transfer it to cold storage (Ledger, SecuX, etc.) otherwise it's in a sort of general population/pool that the exchange owns.  Is this accurate?  Is this also the same while in the coinbase wallet (or other wallet)?

If that is true, then is having your seed phrase engraved on a """"Metal Storage Card"""" just securing your portion of that overall pool of crypto?  If so, do you have to have an active account with that exchange to have access to your crypto or is all you need the seed phrase?

My Coinbase Wallet was just compromised (I have no idea how it happened) and it was drained.  So how do I best secure long term investment crypto without having to worry about hardware failure (cold storage drive) or someone somehow accessing my account?  Lot's going on in this new environment and most of this info is out there...but it's in 400 different places and after spending days and days researching everything, I still don't have a simple answer/explanation.  Help?  Thanks!"

2627,"Many are experiencing a mental block, unable to process the rise of Bitcoin. But the biggest block may be a flawed understanding of Bitcoin's place among all available assets. 

The spectrum of assets appears differently to everyone. The color red might look like blue if you saw it through my eyes. I'm not even sure there is a fixed number of asset categories. My categories look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Business ownership (active or passive via stock ownership)

\-Real estate (active or passive via investment vehicles)

\-Commodities (gold, oil, cattle, etc.)

\-Currencies and fixed income (bonds, CDs, etc.)

\-Cryptocurrencies

\-Futures and financial contracts

\-Collectibles (automobiles, guns, art, antiques, comics, sports/gaming cards, digital objects, etc.) 

&amp;#x200B;

If stocks are your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It doesn't have earnings.” 

If gold is your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It isn't as certain to always be in demand like gold is.” 

If sports cards are your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It is just piece of code on the internet that I can't see, touch, or hold.”

If CDs are your favorite asset, your Bitcoin objection might be: “It is too volatile.”

Five years ago, Bitcoin seemed to me like a johnny-come-lately internet company from the late '90's that was doomed to crash. It was like the company that went public with no actual product or service – just a stated ambition to disintegrate objects into molecules and send them over the internet to then be reassembled at their destination. All hype, no substance.

Here are two important things I believe now that I didn't then:

\-Bitcoin is truly a new asset class, made possible by the internet. Its unique combination of strengths and risks require a completely new asset category. 

\-Bitcoin is solving real problems and addressing real pain points in a way no other asset class has been able to do. People don't understand how Bitcoin can go from less than $.01 at inception to $56000 today. But that increase in dollar value is the nuclear power achieved by a combination of deflationary engineering, decentralization, liquidity and pure ownership via private keys.

In 2009, when Bitcoin was launched, only computer geeks wanted it. A few years later, retail investors wanted it. Today rich people and corporations are buying it. More retail investors, rich people, and corporations are coming. A few governments want to acquire it too. 

We might be underestimating how important Bitcoin will be five or ten years from now. I'll leave you with a few of my favorite quotes: 

“It's not a rally. It's not a bubble. It's a chain reaction spreading like a wildfire in cyberspace.” “It's better than owning all of Manhattan. It's better than owning the center city blocks of the greatest cities in the world. This is like Manhattan in cyberspace. One day, a billion people will live there.” “Bitcoin is the apex property of the human race.” “...Bitcoin is a masterpiece of monetary engineering.""""  -  Michael Saylor 

“You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin.” “Tesla is using only internal and open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly.   Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.” -  Elon Musk"

2634,"I have worked some 20 years as an engineer. Ever since I started working, I had this gut feeling that I would never get enough for retirement, that there would be depreciation, that the system might collapse.

I grew up in a third world country, and I remember my father being VERY upset because of an 80% devaluation -overnight. He had his debts in usd, so we were financially screw. I was very young, did not even knew math, but when he literally eli5 the situation for my, I had complete understanding of the situation.

He owe 10 american bananas and needed about 20 local bananas to pay. But now our bananas were cheaper and he needed 100 bananas to pay for the 10 american bananas. And we only had about 30, so we needed 70 extra bananas and that is how my sister, his wife and the girl she find in a forest ended up working in the streets at night, to get most needed bananas for us.

Joke aside, I never in my life see my family being so miserable overnight.

In 2014, there was """"a voice"""" telling me to buy btc. I did not even understood what it was but I buy in and after the crash, I sold and lost (7 btc).

2015, when the price went up again, the voice kept telling me to buy and I did. I kept doing that and in 2018, after the crash, I did not sell. I understood it was a cycle.

And oh boy, are 3 years long? They are.

But I kept buying, every month a little bit.

If anything, I regret I did not put all my savings there. I kept accumulating satoshis.

During this bullrun, I got probably 3x what I have in my retirement fund already, and I am not planning to sell like I did in 2015.


Another thing I realize while growing up is that both my grandparents had big houses and a number of cars, and my father could only afford a tiny house and 1 car, and myself? I was never willing to get a credit to pay in 30 years for a house half the size of my parents and move on public transport. The system was obviously not working.

All the fears that I had when I was a kid came back to hunt me. Devaluation is not just a phenomenon of third world countries.

Today I do not give a fuck anymore about my retirement money. I am much more upset that the government takes taxes from the risk that I took since 2014. While they keep devaluating the money a little bit every year to a lot sometimes, they want us to pay for they stupid games. And all along, the people who make the rules, politicians backed by big money, keep doing more money.

Is this a rant?

TLDR, I never believe in my retirement fund."

This is a bit surprising to me because their clients have traditionally been pretty conservative. I think that this is a sign of full scale adoption, but that it may take longer than we think.

Governments have also adopted and recognized the importance of BTC and also recognize that governments are incompetent, twith these measures they lost power and today as well as one of the characteristics of BTC, there are no governments, only decentralization, works also for the exchanges of consumer goods for society, what they call peer to peer, I call mutual exchange of trust. Many families were saved on account BTC, many poor families who did not have many hopes of a glorious future, who found that by chance, their deceased relatives had a coldwallet with some satoshis (say that some became millionaire in satoshis). Here in the year 2070 everything is prosperous and we live a full life, where the ideas and ideals followers of Bitcoin built with the ideas of a Satoshi Nakamoto (my parents said he was very important, was a superhero for all of them) must be why we have a statue diamond of him in the center of the Capital Nakamoto Center. 

And by the way, I'm not going to say my name because my parents forbid me to talk to strangers, I just traveled on a time machine built by my grandfather to try to find Satoshi Nakamoto and take a look at him a very tight hug and thanks him for the world he left for me and my friends, but I couldn't. It seems to me he also has a time machine, or he guessed I'd come and escaped. Who knows? 
Well, it's time to go if not my grandfather will find out that I ran away, bye and do not lose hope.

Long live Bitcoin, long live freedom and all its followers, health and prosperity. Bitcoin is the only way, save your lives."

## Both these wallets support

- Creation and signing of Multi-Sig wallets
- Batch transactions
-  UTXO selection
- New wallet address without needing hardware wallet to generate
- Labeling transactions
- Able to connect to personal node
- Detailed overview of transactions
- Price feed
- export transaction history

## Specter features 

- Browser based
- Check bitcoin supply, and the percentage you own
- Bitcoin whitepaper
- Transaction history only

## Sparrow features

- Native application. 
- Fee estimator
- Graph of your sats balance history
- Transaction and balance history
- Electrum server support
- Detailed transaction information
- Notification of incoming transaction

Both wallets have nice UIs and are very user friendly. I've only started using sparrow recently, but it's really starting to grow on me. What I really like about the way it's implemented is that there's a lot of detailed information available **if** you want to see it. And the balance history is very nice to have for auditing purposes.

What do you guys think about these two? In case you haven't yet, I'd recommend trying out both wallets for yourself and decide which works for you."

Elon Musk or Apple should invent something like this.....like a device linked to your private address and shows by colour the amount of Bitcoin you have.

2684,"When you decide to invest in [Bitcoin](https://mybtc.ca/), the first thing you need to understand is the importance of having a proper Bitcoin wallet. A great digital wallet is necessary for storing and managing your Bitcoin securely. Next, you’ll have to decide what type of Bitcoin wallet is the most suitable for your individual needs as a crypto trader. In this article, we’ll introduce you to the basics of digital wallets, discuss different wallet types, and provide you with the best practices for setting up the wallet of your choice.

What Is a Bitcoin Wallet?

Generally, a digital wallet is a software or a physical device that allows users to store, exchange, and keep track of their BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin can’t be stored physically, so the wallet actually stores something known as a private key.

A private key is an automatically generated set of characters that works as a password. Private keys grant you full ownership of your wallet and give you the authority to buy, sell, and transfer your Bitcoin. Therefore, whoever is authorized to access this information, has access to your digital assets as well. If you somehow [lose access to that address](https://medium.com/luno/where-do-lost-bitcoins-go-7e8dd24abd0f), you won’t be able to control your funds by any means.

Setting up your Bitcoin wallet depends on the type of wallet. Due to the growing popularity and expansion of Bitcoin, there’s a wide range of Bitcoin wallets available on the crypto market today. Basically, they fall into three main categories:.

* Online Bitcoin wallets (hot wallets)
* Software Bitcoin wallets (hot wallets)
* Hardware Bitcoin wallets (cold wallets)

Paper Bitcoin wallets were once considered one of the safest Bitcoin cold storage, generated with a key program and printed out on paper as two character strings and two QR codes. However, they were omitted from this list since they’ve become technically obsolete and unpopular with new digital trends.

Online Wallets

Online or web wallets are free and require an internet connection. Technically, they don’t differ from any other online platform we use on a daily basis. All you need to do is select a wallet, create an account, and follow the instructions on the screen. .

Online wallets are set up through a web browser, from any device, without any restrictions. Web wallets are convenient and intuitive but the very fact that your private key is kept on the provider’s server makes them extremely unreliable in terms of security. Therefore, we highly recommend that you avoid keeping large amounts of Bitcoin in online wallets.

2689,"I searched through Peter Schiff’s entire history for every time he posted an origional tweet targeting bitcoin and no others. The criteria was that it could not contain an @, it had to be an origional tweet, it had to call for the failure of bitcoin in some fashion. The content could not be about alternate characters such as GameStop investors or Tesla Buyers, for example. 

There are only a TOTAL of 30 of these origional tweets. The past 10 days he has posted at least one origional anti-bitcoin tweet every day. I excluded this data for now, as it’s the most he has ever tweeted these origional posts. The last lone standing day Schiff posted about BTC is Feb 20 2021.

Of the twenty tweets I analyzed, I found an average return of 718%. Price was measured from the high of the day, to the current price. The lowest return tweet was 20 Feb 2021 with negative 3%. The highest return was his second on  11 Aug 2016 at 9,325%. 

If an investor had bought $1000 of Bitcoin for every one of his original tweets, their cost would be $20,000. The value of that sum today is $160,370.

Not only are the returns great, but only 6 tweets have experience a lower price than their initial cost basis. The largest dip would have been 63% due to the covid deflationary crash. The second lowest was in 2019 of a downside on his fourth tweet of 22%. Talk about low volatility to the downside!

2691,"So hear me out; everyone spends their money on Bitcoin (close to what’s happening right now) barely anyone uses fiat, but they like getting fiat to transfer it to Bitcoin, eventually they notice that there’s no cash circulating.

2692,Looking for a good wallet to use my Bitcoin with. My main priorities are security and quick access to my funds. Thanks👍🙏
2693,"I’m over trying learn and figure out this Bitcoin phase. I don’t know where to start but It’s like a hundred Exchanges that you have to figure out which is Best” to use while seeing people giving out different answers on why the next is NOT Better! I Also read that you have to worry about the Banks shutting down your account! Therefore you should sign up for a online Bank account and the Plaid company basically have access to your account info so that’s another reason why. Then the thing that upsets me the most is the complexing of trying keep your coins SAFE!. You can’t store your coins on a exchange because of the “Not your Keys Not your Coins” ordeal. Now you have to figure out which hot or cold wallet is best for your and is SAFE i rather use a Hot storage or a Online wallet on my phone because i don’t have a PC but once again all i hear and read about is security and hacking. So than you come across the Cold wallet that you need a “PC for”where you have to keep a physical 26 or 12 word password safe from the World! that even your own dog cannot see you writing down! guess what? Now you stuck trying to figure out where to store the most important secured password. Seriously!! i haven’t read or found one good answer to where to SAFELY and the most EFFECTIVE WAY to store this “KEY”. You cannot store it Online, you cannot save it on anything , you cannot tell no one about it, I heard you can’t even store it in the Bank because you never know if the Bank will block you out of the security deposit for whatever reasons. There’s a million reason on why you can’t just store this “Key here and there or even in your own home. Some people might even have there own home and  have to move in with someone or might just stay place to place because everybody living arrangements are not the same. So where do you keep this important “KEY” at especially if your plan on investing more and more over time. I’m starting to understand why there’s less then %3 of the world that really knows or even interested in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The whole system is complex and feels like it’s not even worth the time. Especially when you have to guard a password that’s not even safe on the Moon if you had left it there. You would think it be way easier and less of hurdle without having people to do the most to hide these “KEYS” and passwords that have access to one of the biggest investment of all time"
2694,"I wanted to introduce Bitcoin to a friend, and I created a new wallet using electrum.  I never used it before but it was supposed to be easy.  After the initial setup, I clicked on the receive button and it generated a new address for me.  I then used that address and transferred a small amount of bitcoin to use from my own wallet.  After some time the transaction was confirmed and I could see the balance was updated.  An hour later was about to wrap up and the balance was showing 0.  I checked the transaction and everything was fine and using blockexplorer I can still see the address there with the right balance but Electrum shows zero.  Also, that temporary address is now being shown.  

The source address starts with 32 and the target address starts with bc1 (just in case it influences anything). 

What can I do to make it show the right balance?"
2695,"Now that bitcoin is finding a place as the new digital gold, this seems to have strayed from the original purpose - a widely used currency. This is so that at least miners can earn transaction fees once all coins are eventually mined out.

As block rewards reduce exponentially (as early as 2040) how would bitcoin encourage people to continue mining in order to maintain the security of the network? Reduced difficulty and miners just means a 51% attack is just around the corner. That is not a lot of security to store value. And if bitcoin is worth so much in the future, who would incur gigantic fees just to use the main layer and perform transactions?

To me this feels like an existential threat to bitcoin, making it a long term bubble."

2699,"Hi,

You can correct me if I'm wrong.

I do think coinswitch kuber is not a safe place to store crypto. No where on the website is mentioned where user's crypto is saved. Hot wallets? Cold wallets? Where do they actually store user's crypto?

I have attached email conversations with their customer care executives and the do not have a clue.

People should be aware of the risk they take when they store their crypto on their exchange. Hacks on crypto exchanges have been increasing day by day and it's not at all a safe place to store our crypto on exchanges especially if a crypto exchange is not mentioning anything about security on the website.

Do it with your own risk.

2700,"Hey There!

I am relatively new to btc and only hold about .015btc that I purchased a few weeks ago. I have been doing a bit of research lately and am STRONGLY considering purchasing 1 btc and locking it away for a long time. To do so, I would be taking about 70% of my positions out of the stock market and rolling to btc... so its a significant cost. I feel very clear on the bear case for doing so...

That said, I am having trouble finding a strong (or well thought out) bear case. Lots of outlets seem to just rage some version of """"bitcoin is stupid, it isnt real, people who like bitcoin are stupid, its a bubble"""". While I am still feeling very positive, I would like to read through some well thought out arguments as to why btc might fail before taking that big leap...

2706,"I've seen a lot of questions in the daily lately about banks not allowing transactions to crypto exchanges. I'm one of the people who encountered this, so i decided to find a solution.

I started buying with my debit card because that is still working, but after a while the fees really start adding up. If you don't care about that then perfect, this isn't for you.

Here's what i did.

* Open a free account with revolut (if you know more services like this leave it in the comments).
* Send money from bank account in local currency.
* open a euro account and convert the money.
* open up coinbase pro and click link new account.
* enter the BIC and IBAN numbers from your revolut euro account, and the bank name should be """"Revolut"""".
* from the revolut app enter the CB bank info you get, and make sure that the reference number is correct.
* Make a test transaction and if you did everything right it should show up in a few minutes.
* after that you'll have it saved so you can just send right away and know it's the right info.

This cost me $0 to make the transfers and once everything is set up it's super simple. 

That being said i dont trust revolut, i would never keep my money in their account and i definitely wouldn't buy crypto on their platform.

I'm posting this because i had to spend a lot of time searching old threads on forums to figure everything out when my bank stopped my crypto habit.. Hope this helps you!

2707,"Sorry guys, I have read far and wide for several hours now and I don't seem to be getting anywhere.

Obviously, my bitcoins live on the blockchain network and can never leave it, so I understand that they aren't in themselves physically 'stored' on my Trezor. But then I started to wonder, what *is* it actually doing then? My reading tells me it stores my private key to send bitcoin from my wallet, but that my wallet actually only exists in cyberspace and not on the device itself... is this true?

Sorry if this is a dumb question. If anyone could point me towards an approachable article or youtube video so that I can educate myself, I'd appreciate it!

Cheers"

Another friend just forgot his password and DID NOT write down his 12-word back up. He has about $1000 worth of BTC in the wallet. Has been trying all possible passwords with no success. We'll exhaust all options before trying recovery services.

I want to feel bad for him but goddamn how hard is it to follow instructions when creating a wallet? It literally wont let you create one without practically forcing you to write down the words.

Write it down, make backups, keep it with other valuables. Don't use memory to remember complex passwords, write them down too goddamit."
2709,I’ve bought plenty of bitcoin before but never this amount. Is it best to just buy it all at once when I think the price is the lowest? Maybe should I buy some every hour? Some every day?

No idea if this is technically possible but if it was it might accelerate its adoption, especially if 1 becomes worth hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. People like whole numbers, less inclined to want something if they can only get 0.004532 of it.....Or might doing so make people lose faith in it, I don't know, just a thought."

Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I’d like some insight from the group. As it sits right now at $53/$54K, would you throw more money in or wait for the next dip to do so?

2743,"Everyone tripping about banks stopping their ability to transact due to fraud protections really needs to stop and think about what’s happening. The only money you’re immediately entitled to when transacting are the funds you hold solely in your possession, aka cash in hand. Banks have a liability mandate to depositors. It involves protecting them from malicious actors masquerading as their customer as part of that mandate. If they fail to be somewhat partial to safety, in respect to inconvenience, they stand to lose depositor’s money or being liable to cover the amount from their own pocket or through insurances they maintain. 

If you want to buy Bitcoin, it helps to do so in small amounts regularly when using your card accounts, especially when making initial purchases from exchanges. This will be less likely to trigger fraud protections and the inconvenience this can bring. Criminals know this also. It’s why they usually charge a few dollars and go big shortly after. It’s an attempt to establish a pattern in a new location, and ensure the card numbers work. Banks are playing cat and mouse games to protect you. 

If you really want to buy Bitcoin, use a reputable and widely used exchange and use wire transfers to fund your account in large amounts. You may still trip protections here, especially if you’ve never wired money before, never wired that large an amount, or if the recipient is newly added. 

I’ve never had a bank deny my ability to buy Bitcoin since the early days. I have experienced several occasions of fraud protections delaying my purchases. If you experience an account closure however, it’s most likely due to money laundering rules at the bank, and you may be throwing red flags in other areas. It helps to be realistic, and consider both sides of the argument here. 

Banks don’t really care what they hold for you, but they’re highly concerned with losing it."

Greetings fellow enthusiasts.  I’m relatively new to crypto (been in the game since October), but since then I’ve been learning and studying just about every day.  I’ve learned who the scammers are and who are the smart people I really trust in the space.  The overwhelming narrative I see is that bitcoin is a store of value, and if everything goes to plan it will eventually flip gold’s market cap which would put it at about $500,000 per bitcoin.  Some other bitcoin maxi’s say it will reach 5 million per coin but obviously there is no way to tell.  Obviously nothing is set in stone and crypto is insane but it seems like a relatively safe bet long term.  My question is this, would it be a smart move to DCA into bitcoin basically forever? Just as a working person might put $100 into an index fund every month until they retire? Isn’t it a reasonable bet that if I put 6k a year into bitcoin and not touch it for 10 years I could potentially do extremely well in the next 10-20 years?

its wonderfull and beautiful and all and its unfortunetly outofdate in comparision of cryptocurrency ecosystem today which would be a much more fun and complicated topic of discussion. But that introduction alone deserves the unparamount recognizion of questionably the most well put and well founded underground call to arms in the history of economic rebellion.

Combined with the unparelled tools of computer science technologies, and a genius who built a foundation to a much bigger vision he clearly hoped to see thrive in the futures. And finally put to sleep the abysmal catastrophies caused by very niche structers that hold together and make possible the ongoing natures of globally widespread economic consolidations and their dustributed systems of economic abuse, financial comexities, economic instabilities, and unregulated juggling acts we utilize to achieve our clearly broken as hell upholding of what we only know how to keep going. and its the unfortunate duel edged currency competetion that fuels the races all in all.

His vision was simply to create a decentralized financial environment, because the author and every damn one of you who have studied financial history knows that the story is the same all throughout history. 

power or desire of, atracts wealth. and wealth attracts influence. Influence attracts power and then the attractor ends up in the middle of the circle. with a revolving density we call historically well i call it, the concentration of the god of civilivations, most just say money. 

Buisness, politics, sports, ANY hierarchy or/AND financially incentiviced distrubutions of wealth systems are in constant realtional tandum. 

And just like everything else in economics alone or anything elsewhere, we strive for growth and balance in any area of life. Be it as a gardner, a plummer, a buisness man, a buissness, a bank, a country, a world.
The key is and what the only goal is is balance, because balance promotes self sufficency on every level there is available to it. It promotes health and innovation because the artful man knows conflict always flees from balance, and with conflict goes many avoided troubles and many hours spent dealing with them. Leaving room for expansion rather than problem solving.

2799,"# Update for Cryptopia Claimants and Stakeholders 17 March 2021

17 Mar 2021

Claims process

Since the Claims portal was launched in early December 2020, we have sent an email to all 960,000 account holders who had positive account balances according to Cryptopia’s Records. Over 57% by value of account holders have interacted with us in some way. The claims process is still at stage 1 of the below process:

**ProcessDetails**1. Claims registrationAllows the registration of account holders' details and to make claims for their account balances2. Identity verificationVerifies account holders' identities to the necessary verification standard3. Asset transferInstigates asset transfers to account holders

* While we have a significant number of claimants registering successfully, we appreciate that there are also a number who require support to complete the registration process. This is reflected by the number of tickets being raised through our customer support portal. We have taken on additional support staff to assist account holders to complete the registration process. We assure you that we will action all outstanding tickets prior to moving to stage 3 of the process.
* If you are having issues with the registration please refer to the [**‘Update for Cryptopia Claimants &amp; Common Portal Errors 16 December 2020'**](https://www.grantthornton.co.nz/insights/update-for-cryptopia-claimants--common-portal-errors-16-december-2020/).
* We intend to carry out a further promotion of the portal to accountholders to encourage increased participation and will send a further email inviting account holders to register their details on the portal. We have received a number of emails and calls from account holders claiming that they had not received an email. In the majority of cases we were able to confirm to the account holders that they had received an email. Please double check your email spam folder to check whether you have been contacted.
* The next stage of the claim process 2 ‘Identity verification’ will be launched in the next couple of months, with the asset transfer stage to follow on from this. However, the transfer stage will require the input and approval of the Court particularly in relation to the following:  

   * Approving a distribution model that reflects the nature of stakeholders’ property
   * Confirming what is to be done with unclaimed Crypto-assets
   * Setting a cut-off date for claims to be received and assessed

Sealed orders

* In this update we provide service of orders in respect of realisation of digital assets. We have received orders allowing us to convert 80 BTC into fiat currency to meet the reasonable cost and expenses of and incidental to the protection, preservation, recovery, management, and administration of any Cryptocurrency.
* [**A copy of the sealed orders can be found here \[ 614 kb \]**](https://www.grantthornton.co.nz/globalassets/1.-member-firms/new-zealand/pdfs/cryptopia/2021/sealed-orders61013359.1.pdf).

Where to go for updates

2811,"Hello all,

This is not a troll post or anything. I’ve been studying the whole blockchain technology and how it works past few months. Difference between POS and POW, smart contracts, nfts, tokens vs coins, mining va staking etc. And from what I gathered new generation crypto/networks like BNB on binance smart chain, polkadot, cardano, ethereum 2.0, flow, iota etc are all much better than Bitcoin in every way, transaction speed, energy efficiency, more features. But how is it that bitcoin is leagues apart from altcoins in terms of market capitalization? Is it simply because of first mover advantage or is there another reason I am unaware of? Why do you guys buy bitcoin instead of an altcoin?"
2812,**Here's an analogy to fiat holders and banks. Some people do not trust banks to hold their money for them. The majority though do not trust themselves to store the money at home. Is it possible for Bitcoin to overturn this behavior and drive the new culture of self-storage?**

2814,"There is a lot of short positions being taken during this sell off, and some are probably making some good money.  You can tell because of the price action.  When BTC crosses a $1000 boundary, tons of covers come in.  If it were regular buyers they would have bought at the lower prices, not waterfalls coming in right on the mark.  Some of these shorts probably have decent leverage and once the market direction switches with confidence things will be much different.  Whenever there is an event in a market which causes a decline, shorts take advantage and they move in like sharks to keep the sentiment downward and the price action going down, triggering stops, and causing more sell offs.  

Sure there is some legit panic selling, but a lot of it is shorts.  The volume and price action do not leave any other explanation."

2817,"With increased mining difficulty and more competition for each block, BTC becomes a more scarce resource, so theoretically the price should increase - what do you all think?

In 2017 we had a similar situation where all mining hardware, GPUs, etc were sold our and very hard to acquire. The price shot up as and people took more interest and bought more mining equipment.  

Then the hash rate became higher, some people realized it was harder to profit mining so they stopped — less people mining meant the BTC was less scarce and the price then corrected itself ~80%. 

**clearly there is more acceptance than 2017 now**

What are some thoughts here?? Does the increased mining difficulty and total network hash help support the price from falling?"

I was notified in October 2020 that I needed to transfer all of my crypto assets out of my binance account and into a [binance.us](https://binance.us) account by the end of the year which I promptly did. What I didn't realize was that Binance would then block online access to to my original account once the assets were withdrawn. Now I can't access the account to view my transaction history and can't fill out the crypto transaction history for my 2020 taxes.

Binance has been very slow on account verification (they took TWO MONTHS to verify my new [binance.us](https://binance.us) account) and customer service and I am afraid they will not respond to my request until after the tax deadline.

You don’t need to tell me it’s a store of value and not a currency, i know that. But why is it a better store of value than BCH?

The thing is, even with a store of value, if it’s used worldwide there’s still gonna be a hell of a lot more than 2 transactions per second with it. Not to mention the energy usage.

Bitcoin was a genius invention. But to me it just seems old and clunky now. Is there any reason other than inertia that bitcoin will become the worlds reserve currency instead of a faster, greener crypto?

Please don’t instantly write me off as a gay crypto bear, I still actually hold a decent amount of BTC but i’m just seeing less and less potential in it the more i learn about projects like BCH, NANO, or any of the other hundreds that can do what BTC does but better.

2859,What are your thoughts?
2860,Who do you all think the real Satoshi Nakamoto is?
2861,"There is no doubt that greed plays a crucial role in facilitating the widespread adoption of Bitcoin. The allure of making an early investment to get outsized returns is a very real driver of the adoption of this technology and there is nothing wrong with this. It is fair that those who took the initial risk should see the largest returns; as the popular saying goes “Everyone will get Bitcoin at the price they deserve.”

What concerns me is that many people view Bitcoin as nothing more than an elevator asset. The puerile version of the Bitcoin dream vision found all over the internet goes something like this: invest as much money as possible into Bitcoin as early as possible, HODL, then in 5+ years when it is widely adopted sell your Bitcoin (or take a loan against it) to generate enough fiat currency to live comfortably or indeed lavishly for the rest of your life. Everyone who owns Bitcoin harbors this dream to some extent, but it also strikes me that there is nothing really admirable here and in some ways it is self-defeating. Let me explain.

Consider the following thought experiment: imagine we lived in a world where Bitcoin came into existence not gradually but all at once and the sum total of everyone’s money and investments defined broadly was converted to Bitcoin instantaneously. Never mind the mechanics of how this would occur, it is obviously infeasible. This scenario is essentially the end-game of Bitcoin where people and organizations will convert some of their Bitcoin reserve holdings to local fiat to cover day-to-day expenses while Bitcoin itself will function as a giant worldwide savings account that preserves the purchasing power of deposits until needed at a later point in time. How excited would you be about Bitcoin in this scenario? I imagine that many reading this post would quickly become disenchanted with Bitcoin and move onto the next lottery ticket investment.

To view Bitcoin solely as a one-way ticket to extreme wealth greatly diminishes its full scope and potential. I submit that many people with this mentality have never stopped to think about why they are dreaming this dream. Why do you feel like you need to win the lottery? Everyone’s answer will be different but there are some salient underlying factors that contribute to this collective dream. Perhaps the most important factor is the rising level of wealth inequality that is increasingly manifesting itself in the politics of even the most historically stable developed nations. This wealth inequality, driven in part by the explosion of technology, has only been exacerbated by the policies of central banks and the politicians that influence them. There is a universe of detail to go into here, but one takeaway is that many western countries are heading away from free markets towards the paradigm of centrally planned economies. Those who control the money supply pick winners and losers, the winners being companies and people who have easy access to capital. When a currency is debased the outcomes are not distributed evenly across a society, it is the individuals with the least wealth and access to capital that are hurt the most. It is not hard to imagine the destabilizing effect this has on a society.

It is ironic that so many people view Bitcoin purely as a means to extreme wealth while not even realizing how wealth inequality is contributing to their own dissatisfaction and inability to provide for their families and plan for the future. Bitcoin is more than a lottery ticket, it is a tool to make the world more fair and transparent. It can empower individuals by providing a way to safeguard the monetary energy that is the result of their labor and time. With Bitcoin everyone has the opportunity to take control of their own financial future instead of ceding control to banks and state actors. Going back to the original thought experiment, if Bitcoin were to become the world’s reserve currency without the early adopters accruing excessive wealth it would still be a blessing without comparison. In fact, it would be a miracle. To not see this is to not see all of the injustices and inefficiencies built into our current economic and political systems.

For whatever it is worth, I would exhort this audience to spend less time thinking about the price of Bitcoin and more time considering how it could be used as a force of good to change the world. There are many other angles you could consider along these lines. For example, Bitcoin mining could provide an economic incentive for the development of inexpensive sources of renewable energy and be an economic boon to disadvantaged parts of the world. Be generous with your Bitcoin; it is better to send a little Bitcoin to your family and friends and teach them how it works than it is to hold onto every last Satoshi out of pure greed. We must first educate ourselves and then others for Bitcoin to succeed. Spending time and energy obsessing about daily price fluctuations and how much to stake and when does not help the cause and in fact makes Bitcoin appear toxic to many no-coiners. If that energy is diverted to self-education and teaching it will be much better spent and actually increase the probability that your investment and belief in Bitcoin will pay off later. It will also make the journey more rewarding and enjoyable, and give you even more reasons to HODL when things get choppy."

2895,"I'm willing to be persuaded and I don't mean to be an asshole, I'm just asking the question.  

However, it seems to me that if we are entering a new monetary era, some currencies will be competitive on the basis of their usefulness, security, privacy, transaction and storage ease, etc.  Some other currencies may be competitive based on their ties to real world assets and uses.  For instance, I think USD will have value as long as the government can through you in prison for tax evasion and crypto backed by precious metals will have value corresponding to those assets.  

I just don't see where Bitcoin fits in.  There are other cryptocurrencies and asset classes that seem to do everything that Bitcoin does, but much better.  

Bitcoin may be the first mover, but if eventually we are going to have an accessible and open market for currencies, where does Bitcoin compete? I guess network effects matter, but if the exchanges keep allowing people to exchange a variety of cryptocurrencies, aren't those undermined?

Even if Bitcoin is widely adopted and for example, businesses figure out how to use it in everyday transactions, aren't they also basically figuring how to use every other crypto as well?

I'm sure Bitcoin will end up being of historical importance in some way, but is it really built for the future?"

1. He found this [article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance) explaining how Crypto is making it easier to track people. I've told him about """"boating accidents"""" and how easy it is to just move Crypto to multiple places the government can never know anything about, but he seems very stuck on this point. He thinks that if the IRS comes knocking then the burden of proof is on HIM to prove he DOESN'T have any crypto...
2. DEX's. The above article states that the Government could """"take actions against \[DEX's\]"""" but that doesn't quite make sense to me since they are... decentralized... so if I am missing something here please let me know.
3. Moving crypto anonymously across international borders. I've told him about how easy this is to do, but if anyone could provide a more solid explanation of different ways to do this ( I know of some but I'm guessing there are many) I would be grateful.
4.   Capital gain taxes - This one is so stupid, but he doesn't want to pay taxes on Capital gains. I've tried explaining to him that if his investments do very well (for example- gaining 100,000 and paying 15,000 in taxes is still 85,000 dollars he didn't have before) it won't really matter, but he seems illogically stuck on this point. 
5. FUD - This is what I worry about most. It seems like he is actively finding all the reasons this won't work out, and I think that will make him very susceptible to FUD, does anyone have historical FUD examples so I can try to put things into perspective?

2915,"If I understand correctly, second layer Bitcoin systems are like a system of delaying transactions being processed on the less efficient first layer. Bitcoin's lightning network being an example. When/If the second layer submits transaction for the first layer to process, can all the transactions be submitted as one transaction? Obviously, if it's only between 2 wallets, it can. But, if amounts of a cryptocurrency in many wallet are being changed, can it be submitted as one transaction?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm basically asking if transactions that affect more than two wallets can be processed as one transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

If this isn't the case, I think this would be a great idea for a cryptocurrency. Second layers' might be perfectly scalable in the future. And, if complex transactions between multiple wallets could be processed as one transaction, the crypto would almost be perfectly scalable."

LISTEN. The other day someone posted how much bitcoin they had. It was a decent amount actually. First off, the post gave waaay too many details about their personal life. From stalking their profile I was actually able to find out the following info from a 3 year old account with relatively low reddit activity.

I found their:

Sex

First Name

Birthday

Country

STREET NAME

Phone Brand

Hair Color

Spouse's name and other info

But I just learned what a “halving” is. I’ve known about bitcoin for nearly 10 years, when my friend first introduced me to it along with the SR. 

The new ATHs and market proving made me research more. I don’t feel unique in this.

I am expecting that many more (meaning at some point, a growing proportion) people will be looking at bitcoin as an asset with a 4 year lo a maturation period. In this way, future halvings will be priced in and ease some of the interim volatility. There is a general tendency in markets that the more money is involved, the longer horizons tend to be considered. 

Today, there’s an order of magnitude more people who are aware of the price action following halvings. The pricing in of this expectation beforehand, I believe, is going to occur and significantly reduce inter year volatility before the market has to contend in a more “raw” way with the supply side limits on circulation. 

Tl;dr Even after the volatility is captured, and we transition from price discovery to true appraisal, it is only then that the market can truly price in the deflationary nature of Bitcoin and the price will continue to appreciate astoundingly."

&amp;#x200B;

This is not my plan, but rather how I judge where I am in the entire equation.  As I purchase more at a higher price, its raises my average cost to own a bitcoin.  I try to keep my cost to own bitcoin significantly below fluctuations at a value that I deem is realistic.  

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that we have reached a new support level in the 50K range due to the growing acceptance of institutuions.  So if I continued to make dollar cost average dip purchases to raise my cost of ownership to something like 40K, I am still being safe.  But I want to hear what others thoughts are as to where they may see support levels?  I am not entirely familiar with how the halving cycles play into price predictions, stock to flow models and all that advanced stuff....

Also is there any sort of exchange that allows to to set a """"stop loss"""" (for lack of a better term).  I currently purchase through coinbase and hoddle in my hot wallet.

2960,"I recently read economist Thomas Piketty’s book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century”. It’s been recommended reading from multiple sources and a best seller, so I figured there might be some important lessons in it.

Basically, the central thesis boils down to this:

Let *r* be the rate of return on capital.
Let *g* be the rate of economic growth over the long term.

If r &gt; g then wealth concentrates over time.

Bitcoin, as an investment, has been on a tear as we all know. Not only that but with regulated Bitcoin securities coming online, it’s a bright outlook moving forward.

The historical rate of return of Bitcoin, an asset (capital) is significantly higher than the rate of return of economic growth (GDP in the Western world is ~1-3%, even China is &lt;10%.

Thus, according to the r &gt; g theory, Bitcoin still supports the concentration of wealth. It may upend the existing system, ie central banks, sovereign nations, banks, financial sector, etc - but it does nothing to support democratization of finances in the long run - it just transfers the wealth from one “elite” group of people to another “elite” group.

Is there anything that can be done to address this? Or is Bitcoin agnostic to the issue of wealth distribution?"
2961,"We’re not retards. We’re not apes. Just because somebody is new to Reddit, doesn’t make them uninformed.

If you’re not a bitcoin maximalist then that’s ok, you’re still welcome here but remember what sub you’re on. A sub that preaches anonymity and not telling people things such as how much coin you own. You never know who the person you’re speaking to is and what stake they have. 

So with that said, if you’re new here, let’s try to stay true to what r/bitcoin was made for - to discuss bitcoin. If you need visual confirmation of people’s holdings and want to talk shit, wallstreetbets is only a click away. This isn’t the place though"

This time, he continues to break the established notions of corporate practice that have been created over the centuries. Yesterday Elon Musk's company, Tesla Inc., filed [Form 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021012981/tsla-8k_20210315.htm) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that the outlined changes will take effect March 15.

And you know this wasn't to reported Tesla's acquisition of another $1.5 billion bitcoin? Elon Musk notified the SEC of a change in his position at Tesla and a change in the position of his CFO Zach Kirkhorn.

Since March 15, 2021, Elon Musk's official position at Tesla has changed from “CEO” to “*Technoking of Tesla*”. And the position of CFO of the company Zach Kirkhorn is now called the “*Master of Coin*”. Yup. Just like in the Game of Thrones.

Thus, although the position of Tesla CEO has formally changed, Elon Musk does not leave the post of CEO of Tesla, as expected. But with an official appeal, for example, government agencies, including the SEC, will have to indicate their new titles.

No explanation of this little madness from Elon Musk followed, except for the mysterious tweet published the day before: “Homo sapiens techno: Loves raves &amp; technology”.

We’ll use one of our [Mining Insights Profitability Calculator](https://insights.braiins.com/profitability-calculator) to illustrate why miners should not be thought of purely as “sellers of BTC” who suppress price increases. **Miners are HODLers too.**

**Scenario #1:**

[insights.braiins.com](https://preview.redd.it/euovy2xrien61.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d24e1fd52cd59de0b7fdc5799e04e1195cd9297)

☝️ This chart is an 18-month cash flow visualization for a miner with 6.8 PH/s of hashrate, all S17 Pros.

Bull market parameters:

\- Difficulty increases 4%/month 

\- Price increases 6.5%/month

In this projection, the miner sells all BTC into fiat each month and has an **end profit: $1.1MM**

**Scenario #2:**

[insights.braiins.com](https://preview.redd.it/lqjgn7msien61.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ea9f80590959f245069897c171987a1acaaaf6c)

☝️ This chart is for the exact same miner and all of the exact same inputs, with **one difference:**

**HODL Ratio = 100%**

All profits are kept in BTC instead of selling to fiat and the miner ends with an **end profit: $1.9MM**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We added the HODL Ratio input to our Profitability Calculator in order to make it more useful based on  [The Intelligent Bitcoin Miner](https://www.aniccaresearch.tech/blog/the-intelligent-bitcoin-miner-part-i), a report from Annica Research. It's a must read for understanding the evolution of the BTC mining industry.

2972,"This probably old news, but since I don't pay attention to the NFL, I probably missed it.  I hope they would all like to put half or more of their salary in bitcoin.

2973,"I am interested on getting paid with BTC but my customers are still not interested on buying BTC to pay me. They can only make payments through Wire/ACH. This customers are in USA, I am not. 

Is there any service where they can make an ACH/wire to a service that provides me a """"virtual account"""" that converts this balance and gives me BTC instead ?  I am trying to avoid using banks but my customers are still not in the crypto world and the ONLY way they can pay is through banks. 

Any idea/service on how to solve this? Thanks"
2974,"Lets say you do a simple Native Segwit transaction 10 times, how many bytes will that need vs Batching 10 transactions together in one transaction?"
2975,"I was reading posts yesterday and people were saying that Satoshis could be subdivided on the Lightning Network. First, is this true? Second, can someone explain this to me like I’m a five year old. Thanks."
2976,Buy the dip...everyone I know is using at least half of there stimulus to buy tomorrow...Get It Today and win tomorrow
2977,"Man, this is going to be a rant.   
This is my frustration with traditional banking system.   


I approached 2 brick and mortar bank i.e. Deutsche and Sparkasse in Germany to """"**inquire**"""" about opening a business account. Mind you not the account opening state just to weigh which would be better.   
I have a crypto side hustle which I want to get incorporated. So I am in the process of collecting information.  


Following is my experience:  
Deutsche bank:  
I have an account here, so it was my first choice to ask.    
We need proof. So I say ok , what kind of proofs you need.  (I know I have to show payout from mining or whatever, I have it).

My colleague will get back to you. It's been a month and **NO ONE** has got back to me.   


Sparkasse:

Well glad Germany has more banks, so I go to Sparkasse as one fellow redditor [recommend](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m4r8da/bank_recognised_my_btc_when_getting_a_mortgage/gqwlmhs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)them to be not crypto hostile.  
   
So I show up with a list of questions in my hand. The person I interacted with was really friendly but she had very limited knowledge, so she rings up her colleague and the person on the other end, boy what do I say about her. To begin with """"DO YOUR FUCKING JOB YOU ARE BEING PAID FOR"""".   
She right up said , NO. Ask him to go to his own bank and open account there. I mean I was there just to ask for the procedure and what facilities they provide. They just gave me a piece of paper and said read it yourself.   
I mean these are private banks, but employees don't give a fck about potential customers.   


I understand they have a right to refuse service if they don't want. but **THIS IS THE BARRIER TO ENTRY.** 

And **THIS IS WHY WE NEED BITCOIN.**   
Imagine the opportunity cost I would suffer if I had to go through traditional banking system to setup my business and running around and being at their mercy.   


Rant over.  
TLDR: Went to bank to ask about business account and they won't even answer questions of a potential client."
2978,"Is this normal? I was trying to send $35ish AUD worth of btc andd I had a fee of $28ish AUD worth network fee. I cancelled it.

Is Coinjar just shit or are the fees just that bad with bitcoin? I don't really mess with bitcoin much so I don't really know.

Very restrictive."
2979,I'm trying to get some donations to build a home for a family even if it's only $1 every cent counts even if u share the link it would be greatly appreciated if u need more info don't hesitate to contact me I've already donated the land I spoke to a few government agencies an still haven't received any responses from them so I'm tryin to help themby doin this  ://fundmetnt.com/campaign/help-construct-a-home-for-a-family-ive-already-donated-the-land
2980,"Been buying a lot recently. Grateful to live at home and not worry about bills, I’m still barely on my second semester of my first year in college. I toss most of my money saved up into bitcoin every time it dips or has a “mini dip” like how we have now. I’m saying mini dip because we’re back at levels from like 3 days ago lmao so it’s not a huge dip exactly.

Anyways, i’m up to .2btc almost. Life is good!"
2981,"Well well well, i know im gonna get some hate posts but when you think about it, BTC is pretty useless. We have so many coins outside that do a better job... A WAY BETTER JOB and more eco friendly and friendly in general. 

BTC has it’s price just because the supply and demand AND it’s the FIRST crypto to have ever seen the world. 


Enough said. 

Now try to be a gangsta and answer with your “logic”, i wanna see how many ppl have diff opinions!"
2982,"The Oakland Athletics (A’s) is selling six-person suites for its 2021 home games at the cost of 1 BTC. This follows a growing trend of bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in sports.

The luxury seating suites can fit up to six people and include a variety of amenities. The offer is available until April 1, 2021, and interested buyers must contact the association directly. Oakland Athletics President Dave Kaval said in a statement,

“We invite our fans to become the first bitcoin suite holders in sports. We’re excited to be one of a handful of teams to accept cryptocurrency for payment and the first to price tickets in crypto instead of U.S. currency. The price of a season suite may fluctuate depending on when it’s purchased, which adds to the excitement!”

2984,$700 put into Coinbase pro at 54k.  The 7 day withdrawal waiting period goes by.  I go to transfer off exchange AT 55k and the withdrawal balance is $518.  Where’s my 180 dollars (minus the trading fees)?  Why? Thanks.
2985,"I told them I would be happy to provide any kind of ID and proof, but they refused. So I've got some money in my blockchain wallet, but I can't cash it.  


Does anyone have any suggestion?"
2986,"Since bitcoin always goes up when I sell and drop when I buy, I sold a small fraction to pump the entire btc up.

Jumped 2k the moment I did.

You're welcome."
2987,"So I've read a lot excitement about big institutions and companies entering BTC and crypto in general. In these posts many seem to think there is now a floor on BTC price and that the crashes aren't going to be so severe going further. 

But aren't these the same players who fed the dotcom bubble and caused the housing crash? Isn't it in their very nature to not HODL like a retailer/enthuasist but rather get in cheap, ride the wave up, take profits, short and spread FUD, and repeat the cycle? Why are we thinking the sharks are going to be kind cryptoholders who will save us from the dips from here on out?

Isn't the ride gonne get rougher with these players in the game?"
2988,"Just a thought, so tell me if you think I'm wrong. Yes there are a lot of people who have an interest in its actual use, but how many people are actually buying bitcoin because have a need for it? I'm no cryptocurrency expert but I know there's better coins out there. I think once people start figuring out what all these coins have to offer, bitcoin will drop hard and swiftly. Your thoughts?"

2990,"Start by buying $100 worth (or so) and get some skin in the game. This is what I did, and I couldn't stop reading and researching what Bitcoin is and how it works.

There are plenty of resources for learning about Bitcoin (look in the sidebar to your right), but I feel like having something tangible invested that you can point to and watch helps tremendously. Just my 2 sats."
2991,"You lucky SOB. Although we might see a drop for a little while, personally I doubt it'll go much lower than that, so you got a good deal"
2992,"As per my previous post, when I sell it goes up, when I buy it goes down. 

Its called the Law of Rejection. Kind of like the opposite of the Law of Attraction.

Anyway many HODLers complained I pumped the market too much (+$2k) when I sold some just now. So now I bought again to drive the price down. Its working to the tune of -$1k already. 

If you want more dips then let me know. But don't get too greedy."

2997,"Hi everyone, I'm starting a BTC proyect for spanish speakers. This is not a SPAM post; I would like to recieve ideas from this community that could be useful for new investors or spanish speakers that follow BTC news.  


For now, I have created a twitter account [https://twitter.com/BitcoinNuestro](https://twitter.com/BitcoinNuestro) where I started the following tasks:   
\-Translating @DocumentingBTC and @Bitcoinstimulus  
\-Translating news about BTC or relevant people ideas.  
\-Informing of current BTC price in €UROS and $.  
\-Informing about pros and cons of BTC for new investors.  
\-I'm starting a DCA (dollar cost average) in €UROS to show BTC progression with a real example.  


I would appreciate new ideas and I also encourage you to do the same with your language or community."

With Autarky you can harness the full power of decentralized leveraged on #bsc!


Let's say you want to swap 10 $BNB for $AUTO because you know its price will go up by 20%.
🚀🚀With Autarky you can borrow up to 10x of your initial investment and multiply your 10 $BNB up to 100 $BNB.


💰💰So when the $AUTO price increases, instead of a profit of 2 $BNB(20%) you'll get 20 $BNB minus a small percent that goes to the liquidity providers, insurance fund and burn mechanism.
