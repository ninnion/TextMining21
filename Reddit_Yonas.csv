1001,"Came across a great BTC indicator on an old Trace Mayer podcast episode from like 2018 or 2019 called the “Mayer Multiple”. It’s the multiple of the current Bitcoin price over the 200-days moving average. 

Trace Mayer says the best long-term results were achieved by accumulating Bitcoin whenever the Mayer Multiple was below 2.4. 

It’s currently at 1.92 at the time of writing. Been hovering around 1.97-1.98 the last week or so.

1002,"Hi!

Today I published a post where I offered to make public promises. For self-motivation.

And then an idea struck me!

Please read and do not judge strictly.

I'm not a startup. But I came up with a cool startup idea. All the same, I will not be able to bring it to life, but suddenly someone can! There really is something in this)

See:

Today I read the comments on this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mjw7w5/this\_was\_the\_first\_website\_ever\_created\_to\_buy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mjw7w5/this_was_the_first_website_ever_created_to_buy/)

And there are several comments there with something like this that if they had bought bitcoin then, they certainly would not have been able to keep it until today. Do you already understand where I am leading?)

We need a project that certainly must be secure, maybe with the use of blockchain technologies, which would allow you to close your own bitcoins (and not only) from itself for a certain period.

For example, an application is created that is installed along with a wallet. A separate address is created in the wallet, where part of the coins are transferred. We give access to this wallet to our application. And for example, it changes passwords in such a way that the correct password that you know will be installed to the wallet only at a certain point in time.

The main thing is that the coins are not transferred anywhere for storage, namely, they are simply blocked for a certain moment from their spontaneous actions. 

Or you can make a wallet with such a built-in function. Or maybe come up with some kind of time synchronization?

Of course, you can just put a cold wallet in the safe, but this is not so cool, and you can always get it.

The main idea here is to limit yourself.

I even came up with a few names!

Crypto + Blocked = Cryptocked

Or

Crypto + Frozen = Cryptofroz

[cryptocked.com](https://cryptocked.com) and [cryptofroz.com](https://cryptofroz.com) don't work, so there are no such companies? Probably this is not so important, even if there is, you can think of something else)

If someone reads how do you like the idea itself?"

1005,I've been using coinbase and binance for a while. I've been curious about other ways to trade. If there's any better options out there please let me know!
1006,"TLDR: I'm a mod and I'm considering leaving with possibly a few other mods (once I decide it is time to chat with them on this) and possibly disbanding the group. The admin, (calls himself Satoshi), has no dev or trading experience and is tricking members for their money. I am a long time member of SD, well before they had this many members. We had a few disagreements but I never thought it was anything major, until all of a sudden a team member was removed from the group without any actual explanation. The reason for me considering to now to leave was because the admin was coming up with ideas on how to get as many new members as possible and basically trick them, through either a paid group, “coaching or fund management”.

These kinds of people are scum in the crypto space, they pray on naive newcomers who don’t really know any better and basically stealing from them by providing a completely useless service. They have no morals and no shame.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------Long version----------------------------------------------------------------

For those of you who have joined or are planning to join Satoshi's Data I suggest you read this whole thing. Please understand that this is not a rant. This is to set the record straight once and for all.

I am doing this due to the fact that a team member just got banned for basically no reason what so ever and because of this, I have decided to tell some truths. For reference, I am currently one of the team members on the Satoshi's Data server and I am fed up with this sh1t that I am seeing. I promised myself to stay away from the drama but now I feel like I cannot be quiet anymore.

So the Satoshi's Data server that we know today is not the Satoshi's Data that once was. The team was at one point very good and got on super well. Due to this, the server grew and the members seemed to become closer and closer. They opened up new roles and allowed more people to help the server out. After a while (post the 3k mark from the top of my head) one of the team (who was admin at the time) then did something completely stupid (though I understood why, I kept my mouth shut) and sided with them even though this event created a rift with the remaining mods and server owner. The server owner (a r3tard who calls themselves Satoshi (also, how f4cking original)) banned them from the server and decided to replace them with someone else.

Some time passed by and Satoshi decides to let them back into the server under the pretense that what happened is never talked about again. Since I saw them back in the server, I can only assume that they only agreed to it and it did not come up. They were to never be given a rank again even though personally I would have.

While they were not in the server, they (banned ex-team member) decided to open up their own server (which in my opinion is fine. Competition is always good) and started from the ground up. I can tell you that it uses a very similar layout because they built the layout (with some input from the team) for Satoshi's Data, so because of that I assume they carried over what they knew into the new one (I think that it was due to this they got banned a second time). During this period, One of the team members told the remaining team that they were wanting to step down from their role but they hadn't made up my mind yet. Guess what, the mods I can assume took it upon themselves and removed them from the role while they were still thinking. Pretty nice huh?

Remember how I said that they sided with the guy who got banned? Guess what, since then, the relationship towards them changed completely. Even I felt no longer welcome nor do I still. Not only that, I found that there was a feeling of if anyone disagreed with Satoshi about anything, they would also be removed from the server without a second thought.

I will say this, during the time the ex-team member was banned, the server was (and still is growing nearing 5k now). The server started releasing new changes. The major one was creating a premium subscription. For the people who paid, I am sorry but you bought a subscription from people who have in reality watched a few how-to trade videos on youtube (for free mind you) and now think they are amazing at trading but you could have done the same and become better than them.

The longer I spend watching the calls being released, the more I am convinced that they aren't actual calls but more like pump and dumps for what the current team is already holding. Though it was funny watching them acting surprised that it managed to hit what they said they thought it would hit. So yeah, your so called premium subscription is pointless completely I believe. Doubt you will ever get your money back. I am positive that someone from the team on the server will come out and deny it though.

For those of you who are wondering how the server has managed to grow so much in such a short period of time, guess what, they did some pretty shady things to spread the invites for the server. [Check the screenshots here for a couple of examples.](https://imgur.com/a/qGHHtBJ) I got some other stuff saved as well. People from there reading this post will recognize those names immediately.

Also, I would like to warn other server owners that members from our team are currently going around into other crypto servers right now (with either their primary or alt accounts) and stealing what other people are doing, coming back to our server and adding it to our server. How do I know this, because I have seen this. I have seen how they even joined the ex-team members server and ousted the team member who just got banned for joining that server as well ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/5YcRZAj)). Some time later, similar things started happening in the Satoshi's Data server. Changes to that reflected the exact same bots that others have, channels implemented in SD that were the same as the other servers etc.

After being with the team for so long, I am pretty pissed that this has happened. This is not right at all.

For those who are boosting the server, there are better servers out there to be boosting. I have already started to slow down in this server and I do plan on leaving it soon. I am sorry Satoshi but this cannot go on any longer."

1062,"Who needs to hire a bitcoin recovery expert? Anyone who has lost cryptocurrency funds in any form of a hack, shut down and/or hacked exchange, ransomware, ransoms, fake ICOs or who simply has lost funds by sending them to the wrong address. Did you lose lose access to your account by losing your bitcoin private key, Did you loose your money on a fake recovery site, or did you lose money to fake bitcoin miners? It’s widely believed to be impossible but with the help of DTS and latest AML technology a lot can be done to get recovery to work.
This networks knows how to follow and recover your money, making sure it is refunded. If you got hurt by one of those scammers, please contact one of the recommended recovery experts with the form urgently, we assure you that you will get your money back within a short period of time. Let us examine 2 ways to recover money lost to binary options;
A.) Get Your Money Back Through a Chargeback: If youve fallen victim to a binary options scam then the easiest way to get your money back is through something known as a chargeback. A chargeback is a way of claiming your money back directly via your card-issuer or bank &amp; its very effective.
By issuing a chargeback you do not have to deal with the binary options company directly, instead you simply deal with your card-issuer or bank &amp; they handle the communications with the specific company that scammed you on your behalf.
The good thing about the chargeback is that the customer is generally favored to win the case right from the very start. As a customer issuing a chargeback your card-issuer/bank basically takes your side &amp; then it is up to the merchant (the company that scammed you) to prove that they delivered a quality service to you.
Here are a few quick important points about chargebacks:
You can use a chargeback even if the company has since closed down

B.) Hire a Funds Recovery Expert to Recover Money Lost to Binary Options Forex: Since I spent a lot of time exposing these scam binary systems &amp; brokers over the past couple of years Ive had a lot of people whove been involved (and burned) by binary options systems reach out to me for help.
To this day I still get emails from people, but what Ive noticed recently is a trend of people asking me about specific binary option recovery companies that claim they are dedicated to helping binary options victims to get their money back.
Now these companies certainly can help you recover your money and help you with the chargeback option,Apart from the initial registration payment which is very cheap, they help you recover your funds or btc before you make full payment of services, that way you don’t have to be scared of being scammed, they are the best recovery sites i know of … you can contact them by visiting their website at  *lacertechprotection,com*"

1068,"As a great supporter of blockchain and decentralization, I think we should all do our best to make the cryptocurrency world more accessible if we really want mass adoption.

We probably all agree on the fact that getting started with cryptocurrency has never been so easy as it easy today. However, our ultimate goal must be to show that to people who right now have no idea what crypto is, or to people who are not as """"tech-savvy"""" as some of us might be. That's the only way *everyone* can really gain access to cryptocurrency.

It took a while, but during my spare time I put together a guide on [how to get started with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency](https://towardscryptocurrency.com/get-started-with-cryptocurrency/). I tried to give a little bit of background on blockchain and on the importance of cryptocurrency, before showing how to actually buy and trade cryptocurrency.

Given the target this guide has been written for, I stressed how important it is to familiarize with the technology and terminology before getting started. I emphasized how one should focus on education and avoid following strangers suggestions as much as possible.

Talking about education, I also had a friend of mine help me with this list of [cryptocurrency, blockchain, and trading books](https://towardscryptocurrency.com/resources/best-cryptocurrency-books/) as well. What we did is we basically collected all the books we read about a few trading topics, and picked only the ones we liked the most. Then we put together a few paragraphs per book to share our thoughts and identify what books should be read by whom (mainly depending on their interests and at which point they are along their travel journey).

We plan on expanding the website with more useful guides as time allows, and we would love to get some feedback. Unfortunately, the amount of time it takes to write this sort of things is not negligible, but we would definitely like to get tips on how to improve.

This might not be much when compared to the amount of information available out there, but we did our best to make everything clear. So please, if you have any suggestion for the future let us know.

Thanks!"

1075,"Many of you probably had an economics class in highschool or college that said that production was a function of labor and capital, as affected by some amount of knowledge/technology. This view is limited in the 21st century when everything is integrated with everything, technology continues to outperform people in a variety of sectors, and energy is completely missing from the equation. 

Kenneth Boulding, once a polymath, Quaker, and notable (and to an extent, shunned) economist for his futuristic ideas, did away with the classic production function and suggested that: production is a function of energy, materials, and know-how.. in essence, production is governed by how well a society can channel energy into meaningful outcomes, regardless of the number of workers.

I think at some point institutions will give up on teaching solely neoclassical economics and might incorporate different views.. hopefully they will include Boulding's.

1076,"From what I’ve read the easiest way to “hack” Bitcoin is not to hack it all but hack gpu suppliers. Put a dormant virus in the drivers. Since miner have to replace gpu’s when they break or no longer become profitable.

I’m looking to liquidate a large portion of it to invest into stable stocks/index funds etc. How do I go about getting the money from blockchain wallets to my bank account, is it taxed immediately or do i file it later on? I have withdrawn around $50,000 worth at once from coinbase but i included the figure in title because I imagined taking out that much would have different rules.

I did some research and decided to buy some crypto on local bitcoin. That part went smooth. Then I tried to send the bitcoin to a wallet and here's where all of the confusion starts.

I copied, pasted  my wallet address in the send field and tripple checked. After 4 days I never received the funds. I checked the block and everything was confirmed but the address next to the transaction wasn't the one I pasted in. 
Exodus 
My wallet address: bc1qjl966ul5p5j6zlvh7nsdk7avntaxuft68ezyyq
Transaction id: 2fbc6e56ebb17fc354910ef227a914925253854b2eaac37b732d1b0edc72f575
The address that actually got it: 19vAQ8VnYBauY2cpwuq7PyZqhNK5MgKV8b

So I contacted local bitcoin and they tried to put the blame on the wallet provider then me. Stating that once the crypto is sent it is sent


So I decided to try again with a different wallet.
Same exact result. No crypto received. Funds sent to a different address than what I pasted in and triple checked before I clicked send. 

I'm confused and frustrated. Can anyone explain what might be going on, or how I can resolve it?"

So far in 9 months of buying and scaling out a little bit here and there and buying more I've """"sold"""" 14k worth of fiat into almost 40k (in dollars) worth of digital value.  I've never in my life been able to save that much.

It has just seemed to hover and tantalize the 60k mark. I think (again beginner) that once it does that it will shoot up to the mid 60's with relative ease. It seems to me to be an emotional barrier to cross. I also wonder if the fact that big money and firms are buying into the exchange so that also is stabilizing the price somewhat. There was not a sticking point before 40k and 50k so I wonder why at 60? When it was approaching 10k was there a speedbump like this? It does not affect my decisions or strategy but I am just curious and wonder if any of you think it will climb quickly after getting through the $60k marker?

1138,"So, some years ago I bought some bucks on BTC and stored it on Jaxx Liberty, but now I would like to take it back.

The thing is that fees charged on Jaxx are too high for the amount I have there (even if I set them to """"lower""""). According to my search, I can export my private keys on Jaxx and import it on some other wallet that would allow me to pay less to transfer the money to my exchange. All I would have to pay are the transaction fees from wallet 2 to the exchange.

And yes, I know it would take longer, but I'm willing to wait.

I've tried to import it to B[itcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com/)'s wallet, but the amount won't appear there. I've sign up on Coinbase, but haven't found any way to import the wallet. Same goes for eToro.

So what I am doing wrong? What do I need to do to take money from Jaxx and put it on some other wallet, in order to pay lower transaction fees?"
1139," I heard everyone saying $10k was impossible in 2017 too. Then Bitcoin shut everyone up by running up to $20k. We should stop bitching about these analyses and take them into consideration by trying to run the numbers ourselves to verify or disprove their logic. That's how I got started 10 years ago. I Heard Bitcoin could go to $1 million then, and instead of bitching about how ridiculous the prediction was, I read the articles making the statement, ran the numbers behind their logic myself, and verified the numbers; then I realized $1 million was extremely conservative when I ran the numbers myself, and that the real stabilization number where Bitcoin's growth would slow and resemble the current tech stock market would be something more like 10 million+. And even then that's nowhere near where the math stops, that's just where it stabilizes to the point where then countries can jump in without being able to spike, tank, or drain the market. That's when Bitcoin's liquidity becomes equivalent to the ocean in terms of size and strength"

The chances of a young healthy adult like myself to become permanently disabled in the next 10 years is probably less than 0.1%

I asked this in another email but they didn´t reply since then, so I´m asking here to confirm that POLINIEX have stolen my BTC or may be I´m wrong and it is possible that it can exist a twin address one belonging to BTC and another one completelly different belonging to USDT omni. thanks in advance."
1149,"The story is about me. About a regular guy who got acquainted with BTC only due to one reason — my client suggested me to be paid in BTC in 2017 (summer).
Of course, it was amazing to me, because no more banks and a headache related to documents, invoices etc. 
Then I was seduced by ALTCOINS in late 2017 and exchanged a few of my BTC onto them... That did not play out. In that rush and FOMO I even sent 0.8 BTC to a non-existing address. 
Absolutely stupid behavior. Going through that sad time (thanks to my greediness) I learned one important lesson — you should not rush and act as lemming that runs as all the lemmings around.
Since that, I was only stacking sats. Unless the last drop before the current rally. I sold a few BTC on $4.5k-$12k levels by reading """"BIG"""" twitter accounts.
In the same period of time, I understood that day-trading is not for me, especially with the leverage (you know how that usually happens).
You might think that the lesson learned. But I'm still not sure. Have no idea what should be a game plan for now and I have no confidence that the market will not play a bad game with me again."

1159,"Hi everyone, just wanted to share and get some feedback on my thought process about what to expect with GBTC once the [conversion to an ETF](https://grayscaleinvest.medium.com/grayscales-intentions-for-a-bitcoin-etf-b11e4faf4c05) finally happens. 

GBTC has been referred to as a black hole, as there is no mechanism to redeem shares for BTC. Money goes in, Grayscale buys BTC, and that BTC is never sold.

My first thought upon reading the news was: does it mean that the fund would no longer be a """"black hole""""; i.e., would these coins be effectively back in circulation?

I understand that not all ETFs are necesarily redeemable for the asset they track (for example, not all gold ETFs are redeemable for physical gold). That being said, what would happen if investors favoured another ETF and decided to sell all or near all their GBTC shares? Would GBTC *have to* liquidate a lot of bitcoin?"

To get out of the Great Depression, the United States built weapons for World II

There are a lot of people that think the United States is headed for another great depression soon.

A lot of people blame money printing for this.

This would cause the adoption of bitcoin to go up, not people say. Allowing it to become the world reserve currency.

In order to control / hack / change the bitcoin ledger, to essentially centralize the bitcoin network the bitcoin network one would need to take up 51% of the bitcoin mining power

The United States currently holds the title of having the why most would call the current global currency, the petrol dollar.

If the world looses faith in the petrol dollar, bitcoin would probably become the most globally trusted store of value for international trade. 

China currently holds the title of most bitcoin miners.

The United States hates China.

Do you think world war 3 will be a race between China and the USA to overtake 51% of the mining network in order to centralize the bitcoin network, in effect allowing the USA to come out of its depression through the production of mining rigs the same way it clawed its way out of the Great Depression through the production of weapons?"

1162,"Why has bitcoin consolidated at 58,000 mark?"
1163,"The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in existence surpassed $2 trillion on April 5, according to data from Goingecko, led by the impressive growth of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and other altcoins in 2021.

The cryptocurrency market as a whole has become approximately as valuable as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the second-biggest company in the world after Saudi Arabia's oil giant, Aramco (SE:2222).

The milestone also comes less than three months after the cryptocurrency market surpassed $1 trillion for the first time back on Jan. 7 when the price of Bitcoin was around $33,000.

Will the Ethereum and altcoin bull market continue?

In recent months, several major catalysts have fueled both Bitcoin and Ether to rally strongly to new all-time highs.

Financial institutions, like PayPal and Visa, are beginning to actively support cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the cryptocurrency market's uptrend.

In 2021, Bitcoin has faced several short-term corrections but has now consistently remained above $50,000 for almost a month, with low volatility compared with altcoins, preventing both ETH and the altcoin market from seeing a severe pullback.

In fact, Bitcoin's volatility has dropped to the lowest level since November 2020 as BTC price has been consolidating between $55,000 and $60,000 over the past few days."

Now they are stuck in limbo (mempool) since a week 'cause of the low fees and the increased number of transactions and I don't know what to do.  
1- I can't use CPFP cause I used the change of the first one when sending the second, and with the second tx I sent all that was left on that wallet.  
2- I can't RBF cause mycelium made them not rbf (I also tried an online recreation/signing/broadcast of the transaction giving higher fees, but it didn't let me broadcast it giving me some tx-18 error).  
3- I tried to import my wallet into Electrum or Coinomi in hope it will not consider the unconfirmed transactions, but it indeed showed them and I couldn't  re-send the amount with higher fee.

I know the trick about waiting 2 weeks, but since I stupidly sent one transaction after the other, now I'm scared that if the second gets confirmed before the first, then this will become stuck for real (I read it in some forums, don't know if it's true).

ANY help or reassuring words?

My first question is, are you fundamentally ok with mandatory global KYC and mass perpetual real time surveillance for the entire human species no matter what exchange, website, or app you use?

That is what the Department of Justice has envisioned.

are you ok with the global south being completely debanked and all westerners being prohibited from sending withrawals from these platforms to people in the global south?

Do you like being endlessly prohibited from those platforms just because someone might offer you something that isn't approved by the SEC or CFTC?

CipherTrace's CEO has confirmed now in an interview that the the Fatf guidlines will apply to all P2P, including Bisq and Hodl Hodl, and all Defi such as uniswap. He has confirmed that they will prosecute developers in the manner they prosecuted Bitmex.

Even if you had the entire DeFi system built on Bitcoin Layer 2 RSK smart contracts, they could still prosecute the developers. It doesn't matter if the domestic country's of the said developer does not adopt the Fatf guidelines, their lack of enforced KYC will allegedly allow US servers and citizens to touch the app, therefor making it under US jurisdiction, therefor they will be extradited and prosecuted.

We really, really need to prepare to take these violations and proposed regulations to the Supreme Court on the violation of the 1st and 4rth amendment. as soon as the SEC or DoJ sue some company or developer, the entire industry needs to swarm behind them, fund it legally, and take it to the supreme court. 

We cannot allow the US government to normalize the prosecution of Code, and Developers, the way they got away with passing the Patriot act. Because once they normalize the prosecution of Developers, Crypto will never be safe again, it will be fully captured.

4. I open the account and there is indeed the 9.5 BTC balance, I browse through the website just to see how much they actually put into this, and I find that the site is well organized, all the buttons are clickable, there are **About, Privacy, terms of service** pages with actual content.

5. of course, I do what every normal person would do, and try to withdraw the BTC,  
I put my recipient address and I get an error message noting that the first withdrawal amount can't be above 0.00014 BTC (about $7) """"out of security reasons"""",  
so sure I try to withdraw the max amount, and I get a confirmation of the site, (here I'm sure that nothing would really happen, and probably I will get a message requesting me to put my seeds to continue the process)

6. ***What happened now blew me away.***  
I get a confirmation on my **Binance** account that I have just deposited funds, and indeed my balance just increased by the $7 mentioned above. (**the scammers sent me the funds!!)**

7. Here is the catch, when I try to withdraw the rest 9.4... BTC that has left, I get a popup saying that I have a withdrawal **Min limit** of 9.5...BTC and basically I have to fund my account in order to continue. (Yea sure..) ( [https://imgur.com/EIXThbR](https://imgur.com/EIXThbR))

Please be **aware** and **share** this with your friends, anyone could fall for this out of pure greed.  
You don't usually see this level of commitment in these scams, these guys went beyond what we know, the website is clean and looks very professional and legit, they send you actual money to lure you in, and I'm sure the success rate is crazy here.  
The scam is based in **Israel** from what I can tell, or at least targets Israelis as the OTP asks for an Israeli number (maybe based on location), I can tell that just by the name """"Osnat"""" as it is a common Israeli name and not mine...  
so Thank You for reading and please remember:

1186,"Hi guys! I stumbled upon a YouTube Channel that basically dismantled the idea of fungibility of bitcoin. So basically Bitcoin is not fungible as there are three types of Bitcoin:

\- Virgin 

\- Regular

\- Tainted. 

A Virgin Bitcoin is a Bitcoin that was just recently minted by a miner, it has no transaction history. It's basically new

A Tainted Bitcoin is a Bitcoin that has illicit transaction history. From what I understood there are companies that surveil the public blockchain like Chainalysis that are able to tag a Bitcoin output that they deem are high risk, that they deem are part of illicit transactions.

Regular Bitcoin is a Bitcoin with a transaction history that is clean, there is no illicit transaction history.

In conclusion a Virgin Bitcoin is worth more than a Regular Bitcoin, and a Tainted Bitcoin is worth less than a Regular Bitcoin. Hence Bitcoin is not fungible.

So basically we can't know if we received a Tainted Bitcoin, and if we sent that Tainted Bitcoin on an exchange and they run some sort of analysis on that Bitcoin and see all the hops that it passed they might arrive at a hop that is tagged as illicit  and the exchange will then confiscate the Bitcoin and require to provide documentation saying that you are not the person that made that illicit transaction at that certain hop.

Any thoughts on this?"

I’m a rep with [Menufy](https://www.menufy.com) and we do free online ordering for restaurants, and we’re one of the only companies out there that accepts Bitcoin as a payment option! 

To put it briefly, here’s what we can do for you: 

* Integrate directly into your existing website (or build you a brand new one - for free!) 

* Brand entirely for you, every step of the way. 

* Pickup orders are FREE to the restaurant - just a $1.50 convenience fee to the customer

* Delivery is at just 12.5% (compared to the 20-40%  DoorDash, Grub Hub, etc. would normally charge)

* Integrate with several different POS - Square, Shift4, and more 

OR

* Receive orders on a tablet (you can either use your own, or we can provide one for a refundable deposit), or through text/email/fax

* We’ll also enable your Google Food Ordering buttons (blue ordering buttons on your Google listing) so customers can order straight from there!  

If you are either an interested restaurant owner, or you know someone that owns a restaurant that might be interested - please feel free to reach out to me directly. You can comment on this post or DM me and we can have a discussion about if we’d be a good fit for each other. 

Thanks for stopping by!"

The answer is Regulation.

All Chinese Coins will go.

This includes Bitcoin once the CIA Servers under the Three Gorges Dam controlling it are shutoff.

P.S the WhiteHouse &amp; others in the 34 will flood. They will become a Sanctuary or something else.

Right last time i will explain Bitcoin &amp; why it is going up.

Bitcoin is 70% in China. The rest is spread out. They have virtually shut down the Mining Set Ups in those other countries. 

Lets change this from Bitcoin to Heroin.  You take away 30% spread out allover the world leaving 70% coming from 1 area of the world what happens to supply/demand? The price rises a lot. Then one day the Rods Of God bombs the Shieben out of the 70% left in 1 spot it goes to 0.

The Chinese/Sophisticated Set Up is controlled by CIA Servers under the 3GD.

USA vs China Tech War.

Part of the plan all along.

99.5% of Unregulated China coins will die including Bitcoin when the CIA servers under the Dam get removed/whacked.

&gt;On August 9, 1995, Silicon Valley [startup](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/90s-startup-terrified-microsoft-got-americans-go-online/) [Netscape](https://1995blog.com/2018/11/30/when-the-web-was-new-remembering-netscape-and-its-fall/) Communications made its stunning market debut and effectively [illuminated the emergent World Wide Web](https://1995blog.com/2014/08/08/illuminating-the-web-netscapes-ipo-of-august-1995/) for millions of people who, until then, were only vaguely familiar with its potential and promise.

I ask because governments tax 'owners' based on their belief that people buy and sell and 'own' crypto, and everyone seems to unquestionably accept that..

Noob with immature thoughts here, looking to be proven wrong.

I've read and listened to a lot of bitcoin material recently (after hitting myself for many years for not buying at $400 and thus staying out of the market since then).

I understand that the security of bitcoin is based on (1) the difficulty of reaching and maintaining 51% computing/mining power AND (2) that anyone with this power would be motivated to rather earn money mining than destroy the trust in bitcoin.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

I don't know how you guys feel about nation-states, but I don't think it's unlikely that one of the current superpowers or superpower contenders via a combination of technology, enforcement of laws/bans and superior military power COULD attain this computing power.  


Many would respond: They haven't been successful stopping BTC so far after 10+ years. That's right. But have they really been threatened yet? Not in my view.   


Will they accept the loss of money-printing and inflation-taxing power sitting down? Hell no. If they can oppose it, they will. Let's count out banning for now, this discussion has happened many times.

That takes me to point (2). If they can reach and maintain 51%. What will they do then? 

Destabilise BTC to keep FIAT in play?   
Use their power to """"PRINT"""" money by double, triple transacting if they can't stop bitcoin? What's keeping them from doing this?

1210,"Hello Crypto-MOON-Blockchain Lovers. 

I’ve found my old wallet from 2013. It’s a backup wallet.dat, I’ve used this wallet for years, until my notebook crashed without knowing having a backup (found on a old USB). I made a backup of this wallet years ago, using the “same wallet”for many transaction knowing there are some btc left on it. 

The backup date of the wallet is 3-7-2013. My first deposit on the wallet is made on 4-8-2013. 

While making this “backup wallet” it was empty. 

Do you guys think synchronizing this wallet to btc network makes it able to bring back the btc. 
Knowing this used wallet was empty while making the backup?"

Hence my aim is  to gathers others that experiencing the same issue and create a group where we all together can add to the pressure to the firm and the individuals behind!

There is plenty of rumors around on what’s has happened, but still nothing official from the company. 
Join me in the battle against these thieves!"
1213,What is your price target for bitcoin 10 years from now? Remember to be realistic. I’m not interested in “it will be the currency in the andromeda galaxy” and other hyperbole. For instance my price target for btc back in October when I initially invested was 100k by the end of 2021. And now I see it potentially being higher by the end of the bull run due to institutional interest. I’m uncertain about the 2024 halving and more so the 2028 halving. Where do you see bitcoin a decade from now?
1214,"Best offline bitcoin wallet to use in the US , is there need for verification?"
1215,"Soon I will be moving from the EU to the US for work purposes. My seed backup phrases are stored on a metal plate like this: [https://store.coinkite.com/store/seedplate](https://store.coinkite.com/store/seedplate), whereby one punches the seed words into an exposed metal surface. Each side has 12 words, so one would need to see both sides to access my keys.

&amp;#x200B;

I am questioning what is the best way to take this metal seed phrase plate during the international flight. Obviously, it should never be transported via checked baggage; the only possibility is for carry-on luggage. If anyone sees it, it could be compromised. If it is exposed anywhere in an airport, CCTV could capture it. If the security x-ray screen records it, it could be compromised. A significant (to me) quantity of BTC is kept on these keys, so the compromise case is unacceptable. I could purchase a tamper-proof bag, but I feel like that would only draw more attention to it.

​

My current thinking is that it is not worth the risk of carrying this metal plate with me. I should destroy it, write my keys on paper, carry those in my wallet with me, and then as soon as I arrive in the US, purchase a new metal key backup system. My main concern is that I am nervous about just having my keys on a piece of paper during the flight. What if I lose my hardware wallets and my keys at the same time? Maybe it's worth committing the 48 seed words to memory (2 separate private keys). I don't trust anyone else to store the metal plate for me. Another possibility is moving all of my crypto to a reputable exchange and destroying the seed plate. In that case, even if I lose the backup phrases and hardware wallets, the crypto will (hopefully) be safe on the exchange. I could also purchase a metal backup system that is better for traveling with.

Similar to a skimmer than can gain access to your credit card. You're leaving yourself vulnerable to someone both skimming your credit card and hacking your bitcoin. Any thoughts here? I just want to hold bitcoin in a hardware wallet, keep the wallet in a safe place, potentially even forget about it and then in 10 years realize oh wow yeah that's gotta be pretty valuable by now."

1240,"Hey all, 

I've noticed that the price of BTC on Korean exchanges is much higher than US/global average prices. As of now, the price of BTC on the global market is around 57,000 USD. But on Korean exchanges, it's being traded for around 75,000,000 KRW, or the equivalent of 66,500 USD. I get that there can be a discrepancy of a few percentage points, but this seems very very odd.

Up until at least a month ago, the prices correlated with the exchange rate. 

I don't understand how this can be possible...is the demand for BTC in Korea just that much stronger with a much smaller supply? 

As I can only deposit fiat into a Korean exchange atm, I'm actually thinking of buying a chunk of something like doge, which is more or less the same price, transfer it to a global exchange, convert it to BTC, take that BTC to the Korean exchange and sell it for fiat. It seems like a quick way to bump up my fiat blance by 10\~15% with just a few transfers...or am I missing something?"

1253,"I've recently dived deep into learning about the technology behind bitcoin and I want to better understand the security of the network. Let's say I decided to run a bitcoin node to support the system, however, before I run it, I alter the source code to behave maliciously.

Using Python, SHA-256('103') &gt; SHA-256('1000') = True.

I understand why subtle differences in input messages create vastly different digests, that the output lengths of all SHA-256 hashes are fixed, and that in this example I'm inputting strings - not numbers. 

**My question is why is one digest is 'greater' than another, and how is this determined?** I stumbled across this problem when looking at the target hash value that a Node on the bitcoin blockchain is required to produce (or undershoot) in order to demonstrate Proof of Work.

For the sake of this scenario let’s say I have 100k work of BTC. The 20% down payment on a home would be 45k and after all expenses it would cashflow 250$ per month. 

I am fortunate to have a decent paying job that will allow me to service the debt on the blockfi/ btc loan repayment comfortably + the additional $250 monthly from the income property.

I love bitcoin but I feel it’s biggest downside is it is not an income producing asset, hence the thought of leveraging to buy assets that will pay living expenses at a future date of 10-15 years out. 

Besides a black swan event of an 80% draw down what other things should I consider when scenario planning on a situation like this?"

1276,"This is my forecast for the price of Bitcoin based on a unique theory of astrology that I have developed. Rather than using a date in the past (Jan 3, 2009, 6h15 pm 0 - the time of the First Block, which is what astrologers typically use ), this theory uses the positions of the planets in the sky above us to make a prediction for each day. In this theory, Bitcoin is ruled by the Air Element. When the Fire connects with the Air element, the price of Bitcoin declines. When the Water element connects with the Air element the price of Bitcoin rises. This is my forecast for next week based solely on this theory: April 5 will close down - a decent down-day. April 6 is not an important day, but the price might rise slightly or decline slightly. **April 7 is the most important day of next week and the price will see a strong decline of 4K/Bitcoin or more.** April 7 will also be a swing low on the bigger picture. April 8 might first see further declines, but in the end, the price will close up. April 9 is also trending higher. If you looking to buy, you can do so on April 7 close. If you are a trader, you will take profits from last week soon as both April 5 and 7 will close down. April 7 is the strongest down-day of this week."

1288,"Life and annuity companies are increasingly dedicating part of their asset base to Bitcoin (BTC). While the top crypto has delivered the best returns over the past decade, the long-talked-about institutional herd seems to be finally making its way to the BTC market.

During the bear market of 2018, Bitcoin developmental efforts from multiple stakeholders seemed to focus on improving BTC’s regulatory stance. These efforts saw the emergence of institutional-grade custody platforms among other prerequisites needed for greater participation by regulated entities.

With pension funds and insurance joining other public corporations in investing in Bitcoin, attention is now shifting to whether governments themselves will begin to invest in BTC via their sovereign wealth funds. Meanwhile, 2021 remains a bullish year for the largest asset by market capitalization with its March closeout representing the best Q1 performance in eight years.

Retirement funds holding Bitcoin:

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, KiwiSaver, a $350-million retirement plan operated by New Zealand Funds Management, recently allocated 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. At the time, James Grigor, chief investment officer at NZ Funds, remarked that Bitcoin’s similarities to gold make BTC an attractive asset for life and annuity firms.

According to Grigor, NZ Funds amended its offer documents back in 2020 to include cryptocurrency investments in its catalog. This move allowed the company to purchase BTC back in October when Bitcoin was trading around the $10,000 price mark"

5. **Find good software**. If the software interacts directly with financial exchanges, it is a useful tool in such rapidly changing settings of daily trading.
6. **Catch up to speed with the recent industry updates**.
7. **Get into politics**. Political events may impact.

1313,"As we all know, cryptocurrency is a digital fiat currency with no value in and of itself. Dr. Burry has spoken out against Bitcoin in the past, and believes there is a likelihood of a massive wealth transfer (short) that will make the tech itself a bubble and absolutely worthless in the future. He doesn’t see the idea as lasting long term.

I recently watched The Big Short, and it is quite good. What happened with the housing crisis in 2008 is not very similar to what are seeing with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The banks were outright lying to the public. While I do see the likelihood of a massive short in the future, I am not quite sure the tech itself will be a bubble. There are a few reasons for this.

For one, people are angry at authoritarians (people that lack humility, honesty, warmth, and integrity). Even though massive shorts can and likely will happen with cryptocurrencies, people still believe in and understand WHY the technology exists (which is value). It gives human beings direct access to each other for trade without worry of lying or manipulation from a government or a bank. That is EXTREMELY valuable for human beings. This has never happened before.

Secondly, the tech is groundbreaking and exciting. It’s doing for money in a positive way what Napster did in a negative way for music. People love the idea of a digital free market that is outside the boundaries of the conventional financial system. The technology is cool, but only if governments across the globe don’t intervene, and also if we can keep the system honest, transparent, and free from hacking.

What are your thoughts? I want to see what other human things think about these ideas. What I see as happening is the potential of emotional and mental liberation from authority figures globally. If we take control of money away from governments and banks, that is an extremely valuable idea, and this is the reason WHY I think Dr. Burry may be incorrect about cryptocurrencies. Apples and oranges."

I'm sure there are tax implications that I will have to deal with, but I don't know what they are... Also where do you advertise a house for Bitcoins? How does the process work? I would do it with a title company , but they would want to be paid in US currency, so I'm not sure how I would structure the deal.... The only houses I've seen for sale are the McMansions and that, just isn't what I'm offering. This is just a regular house near supermarkets and fast-food places."

1316,"If a transaction is set up by Alice to Pay Bob, but the lock time for the transaction to be released to Bob is set up 7 days in the future, when is the transaction validated by the network? Is the transaction validated at the time Alice created and drafted the transaction or is the transaction validated right before the lock time expires? Or does it just depend on the Mempool and other payments with higher priority?

Further, how does the blockchain account for these transactions with future lock times and when are they recorded to the block"
1317,"Holy shit I need to vent, because the debate over Bitcoin's energy consumption has driven me mad. It's both sides, really. 

Bitcoin skeptics cite some false metric like """"energy cost per transaction"""", which fundamentally misunderstands how blockchains work, and then crypto-enthusiasts will reply with some lazy whataboutism or make some completely bent over backwards argument like """"actually using a fuck ton of electricity encourages more efficient use and therefore it's good for the environment!""""

I mean, come on. It's true that people give unusual amounts of attention to crypto mining when there's plenty of other wasteful shit out there, but whataboutism always weakens your argument. It's a logical fallacy.

It is also true that Bitcoin mining tends to gravitate towards energy that might have otherwise been wasted, but let's not say that makes it a net positive on the environment. That argument just sounds ridiculous to any skeptics; it's not convincing anyone.

Can supporters please directly address the skeptics where they're wrong? It's pretty easy, because most of their argument hinges on a misunderstanding. Like, no, you cannot literally just take the energy the network consumes to mine a block and divide that by the number of transactions per block to get an eye-popping """"energy cost per transaction"""", then linearly extrapolate that data so it shows that mining will use up all the world's energy in -1 years.

 The problem isn't transactions, it's mining, and the transaction throughput has nothing to do with how much is mined. I've noticed that they don't know what blocks are and/or assume that when blocks are filled, a new one is instantly created on demand, when in fact when blocks fill your transaction fee goes up and it's queued for the next available block. Blocks go through no matter whether they're empty or full, completely falsifying this metric.

Also, it is true that Bitcoin uses as much electricity as a small country, but do you know how small a small country is? Well, even if we assume that mining is powered entirely by coal, it's contributing a grand total of [0.17% of the world's CO2 emissions.](https://cbeci.org/faq/) That's not boiling the oceans now is it? I know that number can go up, but I cite it to show how overblown the concerns are. 

What's that? 0.17% is too high when it could be 0.00%? Yeah, fair. I mean, other consensus mechanisms like proof of stake have their own problems, but that's up to you. I don't really have much of an opinion on that debate because I feel like it's for developers and not Redditors, but I see both sides.

I never intended for this post to sound like """"my argument is better than yours,"""" but I really think we as crypto supporters need to do better. 

TL;DR it's maddening to see nocoiners scream about how Bitcoin is boiling the oceans, but it gets even more maddening to see bitcoiners respond with stupid arguments."

So I made this webpage with exactly that. It has a bunch of fun and useful indicators for retail btc traders, along with interpretations of them.

I actually think MSTR stock will be a better Bitcoin play than any trust or ETF on the stock market, or even Bitcoin itself over the next 10 years.

Here is why:
1. MSTR is a well-run company that produces ~$75M in profit every year from their actual business.

2. They already own 90,000+ BTC and clearly do not plan on selling.

3. If a crypto bear market does come, MSTR will just keep adding to their BTC position and will have more in the next bull run.

4. MSTR will protect their BTC better than just about anyone.

1327,"So I tried asking this question in the daily discussion thread but didn’t receive any help..

I’m a bit of a sports gambler and I use a kinda sketchy website to gamble because of the restrictions on gambling in my state. 

The website has a payout option for bitcoin. Essentially you use your debit card to deposit USD into your account on the website, then you bet, then when you want to cash out, you copy your coinbase pro wallet address into the site and it sends your earnings in bitcoin to your coinbase pro account.

The reason I like this option is 1) obviously, it’s Bitcoin and not USD, and 2) it is the instant form of cashing out that they offer. Otherwise they mail you a check that takes weeks to receive. 

My question is, is there any risk to my holdings of bitcoin when I doing this? Could the website/someone else steal the bitcoin in my coinbase account based on this? The only info you type in is your wallet address. No seed phrase or anything like that. My thoughts are that it’s just like someone sending you bitcoin. No security risk. But just want to make sure?

I transfer my bitcoin from coinbase pro to my Trezor every couple of weeks, if that helps. 

On another note, I noticed that the website I use to gamble accepts credit cards. Would there be any downside to literally just depositing my max credit limit into the account and immediately cashing out to bitcoin without ever betting? I’d essentially just be using a loophole to buy bitcoin on credit. I make enough in salary to pay the credit card every month, obviously. So that’s not the issue and I wouldn’t be paying any interest fees. 

Thanks for any help!"

Hello everyone,

I wanted to post this Question to [r/BitcoinMining](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/) and [r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/) for maximum range.  
To the moderators: If it dosent fit in [r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/) just delete it!

I recently purchased two solar modules with a combined output of 660 Watts(peak) with an inverter that peaks out at about 600 Watts and directly routes the electricity in my apartment.

The system consists of the following items:  
2x Canadian Solar Photovoltaik modules (330 Watt(peak) each) \[220€\]  
1x Envertech EVT560 Inverter \[200€\]

The Idea behind the photovoltaik modules started out as reducing my electricity bill which already shows positive effects.  
I also started to run my dishwasher and washing machine only on sunny days to get the maximum effect.  
I know this is a rather small poweroutput to mine in any significant way.  
But I still want to use the produced energy somehow as to not waste too much.  
I am in the fortunate situation that I can work from home so I already use some of the energy myself.  
(about 60-120 Watt per hour -&gt; normal working Laptop with an extra monitor)

Thats why I devised a plan to use a miner anytime I am not home and am not washing any dishes or clothes.

I already calculated how much I am currently able to mine.  
Here a list I devised of miners that could be suitable, including a possible purchasing price and return on investment if I only mine 5 hours a day for 21 sunny days per month:

[https://preview.redd.it/akhhit67u5r61.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2675820c95f6deb776ba6c1cc54781f65b64c7d5](https://preview.redd.it/akhhit67u5r61.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2675820c95f6deb776ba6c1cc54781f65b64c7d5)

I calculated the €/day with through this website:  
[https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=0&amp;HashingUnit=GH%2Fs&amp;PowerConsumption=0&amp;CostPerkWh=0&amp;MiningPoolFee=1](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=0&amp;HashingUnit=GH%2Fs&amp;PowerConsumption=0&amp;CostPerkWh=0&amp;MiningPoolFee=1)

Yes, I understand that this a rather small amout of mining power.  
I just wanted to use as much self produced power as possible.

The perfect Sunny Conditions would look as follows:  
400 Watt from 11:00 till \~16:00 (5 Hours)

[https://preview.redd.it/ct4dof6au5r61.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c19bea8ae84d8fbaf52408b37942eb16af8b250](https://preview.redd.it/ct4dof6au5r61.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c19bea8ae84d8fbaf52408b37942eb16af8b250)

Note: I can set up the modules a little bit differently to maximize the time I get 400 Watts. I am looking into that.

I already looked into mining with other miners.

Goldshells """"HS1-PLUS"""" for instance unfortunately needs a PC but still only uses about 115Watts which means I can run it for longer but it also is more expensive as the miners I listed in the picture above.

For the time being I only looked into SHA-256 Miners as to only mine Bitcoin, but I am open to suggestions.

I also only looked into antminer as I wanted to start it remotely and it automaticaly starts up to mine without having to manually sing into any interface or website.

The idea was to plug the antminer in a smartplug where I can remotely control the boot up time and also easily monitor the electricity usage.

I also found a forum from 2017 where they discuss running a miner at about 400 Watts and underclocking the Antminer S7.  
Thats where I got the idea and GH/s from, which you can find in my calculations.

\[see: [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1912307.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1912307.0)\]

The idea for a rasperry pi with USB-miners also came up but they (USB-miners) are more expensive and I need to set it up with a rasperry pi which I may not be abel to do easily.  
(I already saw a video how to set up an Antminer S7 which I found to be quite easy)

Does anyone have a similar setting?  
Should I look into altcoins to mine more eficiently?

The most important question I couldnt find an answer to is, if I can run it 5 hours a day sparingly throughout the month without getting kicked out of the mining pool for not being active enough.

First of all, \*sorry for my english\* it’s not my native language.

Today is a big day for me. I just sold all of my crypto to pay lawyers and paperwork to get my italian citizenship.

Last year I made two goals (my moons), first one was the prices of everything related to paperwork/lawyers etc and the second was the ticket and life in Italy for at least 3 months while I wait for the citizenship to get a job.

Today I hit my first one.

I was saving money and last year I started saving it on crypto as well and today was the day that I finally got enough to pay all the paperwork/lawyers fees/translations.

I will start saving again from next month on because after the paperwork is done I need to go to Italy to start the process of the citizenship there and of course, crypto is the future!

I’m in Argentina but my great-grandfather came from Italy, so by blood and proving it I have the right to get the citizenship. It’s a long and expensive process but worth it. I don’t know what to expect when I get to Europe but I hope it will be better than here and more opportunities to succeed. 

100 years ago he came looking for a better life, now it’s my turn.

1349,"For about two years, I have been trying to buy Bitcoin with no success whatsoever. 

Since KYC laws were introduced, my options have been limited to zero. I do not have a government issued ID (not that I would feel comfortable basically doxxing myself to these exchanges anyway.) 

I also do not have a PayPal to use. I did make one a while back, but it’s a personal account and I don’t want people to see my full legal name and address whenever I pay them for Bitcoin. I thought I could make a new “business” one with a nickname, but I’m thinking it would probably just limit my account permanently if I try to use the same card and phone number again. The PayPal subreddit has an “I hate PayPal” flair and it just seems too temperamental to try and mess with.

There was Paxful. You can trade Gift cards for BTC on there which I thought would be just right for me. However, they too introduced KYC rules and now you can’t withdraw money from your wallet without sending them photos of yourself. I  also tried a trading subreddit last year and got scammed. Kill me.

Lastly, I live in the UK, so there’s no buying BTC with Cashapp or PayPal and the few ATMS are miles away from me (and I think these brands want your ID too.)

Just wanted to ask what you guys think of mining through Nice Hash? It seems like a great opportunity to invest in some hardware to do some mining for you. I understand that there is electricity costs and all of that, but it seems like you can make some decent profit and you can establish a passive income of Bitcoin for youself. 

All input would be appreciated. 

Thank you."
1353,"Just saying. I was banned from crypto.com here in Reddit for asking why we cannot hold our own Pass Phrase for NFT'S and why we have to pay a commission when we sell our NFT wich we bought from them in the first place!

1354,"With my monthly salary, I'm taking a £50~ deduction and it's being put into a private pension. Of which, my employer is matching 50%. I'm wondering if it would be worth stopping the deduction, then spending the £50~ on BTC.

Even over 5 years, that is something I can live without, and depending on how the investment turns out, either continue, or return to the original pension scheme.

Any advice is appreciated. This could be a smart move through my inexperienced eyes, or could be a whacky one. Thanks guys."
1355,"I recently got two of these scam matches in just one day in UK. I know it's been going on for a while and mentioned before but it seems more rampant than ever these days, hence this post. The pattern:

* Pretty Asian girl in her late 20s, early 30s
* She says she's currently looking for friends, not love or ONS =&gt; you won't flirt too much but talk about all kinds of things
* She in/near your city but is currently visiting family for a few weeks/months =&gt; you can't meet her in person
* She quickly wants to move on to Whatsapp
* I matched bots before but here it appeared to be 'real' humans behind the messages

For over a week, we've been talking normal things, food, hobbies, what books you like reading. She sent me pics of her meals and selfies, all looked legit. She kept asking """"what are you doing today"""" every day, once I mentioned Bitcoin and she boasted she made 21 BTC. She offered to help me make some quick money, finally she sent me some images/download links which I obviously didn't click.

1359,"I was thinking about what steps one should take to protect their bitcoin thats in cold storage and was wondering what methods people here use, obviously nothing too specific but just general ideas. 

Ive been thinking about getting a safe to put the wallet/seed phrase in, although I worry this is too obvious of a place to store valuables. Somebody might just decide to run off with it even if they've never heard of bitcoin thinking I'm storing gold or whatever, obviously you try to pick a good hiding place to put a safe but it does seem like an obvious target if it ever got found. Ive laughed at the idea of putting real gold in a safe as a decoy and taping the wallet to the roof of the safe.

Also writing down the seed phrase and leaving it in multiple locations seems like it could increase the odds of it being compromised. But also leaving it stored in the same location as the wallet seems like it could be a bad idea?

It basically declares everyone a """"Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)"""" 

The following entities are declared to be VASPs:

* any P2P exchange or service
* decentralized exchange (DEXs) incl. matching or transaction enablement
* certain decentralized application (dApp) owners, developers and operators
* crypto escrow services (i.e. most DeFi protocols)
* certain non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
* anyone who commissions others to build the above

If I understand correctly, VASPs will be required to add KYC gateways or require account/signup to the services listed above.

1365,"So, during the lockdown. I dove into crypto and started investing November 2020.

I have been swapping alt coins extensively. However, I did not know that swapping crypto to crypto was taxable. Which begs to my question. 

How do I pay that swap from crypto to crypto if I have no fiat funds to pay for that capital gain. I’m really confused how that works. Does it force me to cash it out to cover my costs for the tax.

From my understanding, The only thing I should pay for is that if I decide to convert my gains into GBP into a UK bank account (MONZO).

For example, from all my trades (swapping alt coins) I have only ever converted USDT to GBP/BTC/GBP and ADA/GBP to a total amount of £12,000. Which I thought was the free allowance.

I have not exceeded that in terms of withdrawal from Binance. Even though my current gains have grown, I have never exceeded to take profit over £12,000. Therefore, is there any point in declaring.

My understanding was that. I only ever have to declare if my cashout (Crypto to fiat into a bank account) if I go over the Capital Gains allowance. Which I haven’t. I just want to keep my bag growing. 

I don’t want to tax evade, I just want to know the proper way to do this. How can they expect me to pay for a crypto to crypto swap when I am not even benefiting from the gain because I’m just riding the percentages and not cashing it to GBP. 

I really just don’t understand how this works. Also, is it too late for me to declare such information. 

Thank-you very much"
1366,"In 2017, BTC split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. AFAIK, if you had, let's say, 5 BTC before the split, after the split you would have 5 BTC AND 5 BCH.

This article has an interesting take on why Multisig is in practice less secure than Single Sig with the majority of current hardware wallets. His arguments are sound, in that once has to trust the machine is uncompromised when setting up multisig, and verifying addresses on the hardware device itself become insecure because the XPUB may be altered.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems only Bitbox02 currently gets around this potential vulnerability, because it verifies each XPUB for each multisig key upon setup, and remembers the other XPUBs on the hardware device.

My question is in regards to bitcoin. On average there's a %200 growth every year for the last 10 years. So every year the price of bitcoin (on average) doubles and has done so for the last 10 years.  


so if you were to throw $100 in then year 2 it would be $200 and year 3 it would be $400.  


When you take 0.1 cent. One penny. And for 30 days you double it... on day 30 you end up with $5,368,709.12  - This is fact, run a calculator, or google it.  


So is that penny increasing %200 everyday?? yes right?? because %200 is doubling...  


Anyways, I am not able to see the flaw if there's a flaw in my logic... but my logic goes as follows.  


Double a penny every year for 30 years, wouldn't it end up at the same number as doubling a penny every day for 30 days?? why would it be different???  


  
So in that sense... Throwing a penny into bitcoin... and if the %200 average rate continues.. Wouldn't that penny turn into $5,368.709.12 in 30 years???"

1387,"I know this might sound provocative, but I read some interesting points about what which I would like to share, hopefully people read it with a broad mind and not just bash the post. Also, I don't like to support something blindly, but do like to read diverse views. What do you guys think ?

--------------------------------

Technically Bitcoin is a speculative instrument. Your investment only makes money if you sell it later, so it’s like gold in that manner.

That said, it is absolutely a speculative investment surrounded by a cult.

There’s zero question about that.

Let’s take a look at a list of ’10 signs you’re in a cult’

10 Signs You’re Probably In A Cult – Sam &amp; Tanner – Medium

Number one is that you cannot criticize the leader.

This is true. Satoshi Nakomoto is beyond reproach. The whitepaper CANNOT be criticized by any means. Bitcoin Cash ABC, SV, etc, these all hinge on the idea of different interpretations of The Holy Whitepaper, not claiming anything was incorrect.

Number two is that the group prevents skepticism.

Hmm.

Have you ever seen commenters on Twitter or Quora? Any criticism of cryptocurrency is just ‘FUD’. Sometimes, you’re banker-backed FUD. Sometimes you’re a government stooge, but by god, everything is just an attempt to sow Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt!

Number three is that the group delegitimizes former members.

Ooh, I’ve got this one! Bitfinexed on twitter held Bitcoin, realized it was being manipulated, bailed out of it. Now he tries to report what’s going on. A popular mining pool has been attempting to doxx him forever now, finally settling on some poor guy who happened to share his interest in EVE and the phrase ‘boom. done.’

Number four is that the group is paranoid about the outside world.

There’s a bunch of good quotes on this, but have you ever been to /r/Bitcoin? There’s always people insisting that the banks/government are ‘conspiring’ to destroy Bitcoin.

Number five is the dependence on shame.

Go watch what happens to anyone who admits selling their Bitcoins. They’re mocked for having ‘weak hands’. ‘Thanks for the cheap coins’. There’s absolutely a community of shunning anyone who decides—even to spend their Bitcoins on actual things, instead of HODLing.

Number six is that the leader is ‘above the law’.

I mean, he’s probably dead, but I guarantee you these guys would lay down their lives for Satoshi if he ever provably showed himself. You should see the sycophants of Craig Wright, who’s merely claiming it roughly unopposed.

Number seven is the use of constant platitudes for thought reform purposes.

‘Just keep HODLing’. ‘It’s just Chinese New Year.’ ‘Ignore the FUD.’ There’s a whole mythos built around the brave idea that you’re changing the world by not selling your bitcoins. This is exactly what happens.

Number eight is that ‘the group is elitist’.

I’m just going to use Medium’s quote here. “If your group is the solution for all the world’s problems, you’re probably in a cult.”

OK, is anyone going to contest to me that people have claimed Bitcoin will solve literally every problem on earth?

Number nine is a lack of financial transparency.

Someone is going to say ‘ha! The blockchain is fully transparent and a public ledger so everyone knows!’ and I’m going to look back over at number seven.

Sure. Bitcoin gets off on this one, but only because it’s literally a cult of financial transparenc-

oh hi Tether.

Number ten is secret rites.

Hmm. That’s a bit harder with an internet community, but then again, I have heard some goddamn things go down on that blockchain cruise and I remember one Bitcoin meeting where they..burnt effigies of Roger Ver?

Anyway, at bare minimum we have eight out of ten signs of being a cult DOWN and SOLID, with a scant couple that are sketchy.

----------------------------
I believe that there are certain fraudsters like Michael Saylor, when folks like those support bitcoin, I believe it's for their own good and not because they believe in this asset or anything. They r just looking for their own greedy interests. If you guys want to read more, search about fraud allegations against that dude.

Anyways what do you guys think? Have an open mind when replying."

However nowdays when I try to do similar thing (with now cool OpenDime devices) it does not have a same effect anymore.

I want to start a thread about the possible risks to Bitcoin which would impair its functionality (currency) or integrity (store of value), either partially or fully. I want to learn more about what the space of outcomes looks like and their impacts and likelihoods. Hoping this community can clear some things up for me. Here's a few to start but I want people to add more:

1. User error or bug which is introduced by humans running the nodes. Pomp said he thinks is the most likely risk. Would this cause a fork like BCH? If so, isn't it likely that the vast majority of nodes would carry on with the original blockchain? 
2. Balkanization of the internet. The bitcoin network relies on each node being able to communicate with the other nodes. What happens if certain countries cut off internet access to their citizens? The total hash rate would decrease and users within said countries would be affected but beyond that the rest of the network would continue adding new blocks and then when the access resumed, those nodes would sync back up?"

So that money is stuck in there, and I can't do anything with it. Does anyone know how to solve either/both of these problems?

1413,"Hello,

On August 01, 2018 the FBI seized **39.67004483 Bitcoin**, from AhmadWagaafe Hared in Tuscon, AZ for forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(C).  [See link here](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:3bgNorKjY-gJ:https://pdf4pro.com/amp/cdn/federal-bureau-of-investigation-about-15c1ad.pdf+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us)

This bitcoin then later shows up in an inditement against Mr. Ditman [see link here](https://stopsimcrime.org/legal/criminal/california-v-ditman/).
The same **39.67004483 Bitcoin** is listed in the inditement (scroll to the very end to see the Bitcoin listed on page 15 of the document).

The victims have been asked to submit petitions for remission and some of us are wondering if it is worth it. I'm skeptical if the victims will actually receive any Bitcoin in return. When the FBI was asked if they had managed to seize Bitcoin, BCH or BSV the FBI refused to answer the question. They also refused to produce an address on the blockchain in which these funds are held. I'm not sure I trust the FBI to discern between these different types of assets.

Other than waiting for the FBI to volunteer this information is there any way to know for certain what type of asset the government actually seized?

Thank you very much"
1414,"Where can I find a Bitcoin node implementation, which is capable of thousands of searches per minute, without degrading performance of the node?

I am aware of two Bitcoin node implementations.

1. [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)
2. [Bitcoin Ops btcd](https://github.com/bitcoinops/btcd)

I am looking for a BTC node implementation, which implements higher performance search capabilities, so I can search using syntax similar in capabiilty to SQL.  I understand why LevelDB was chosen in the Bitcoin Core implementation (not sure what is used in the btcd implementation), but search performance does not stand up to my use case of executing thousands of searches (using bloom filters) per minute, [as described here](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/transaction-bloom-filtering/).

I have written a searchable database back-end using PostgreSQL, but its database must be pruned in order to archieve the high performance I require, which is not optimal.  Thiking out loud, it seems like a NoSQL database like Cassandra, MongoDB, or the like might be better suited to this use case.  But, I have not been able to find a Bitcoin implementation, which uses a NoSQL or comporable database.  

With that that in mind, does anyone know of a Bitcoin, or altcoin, node, which meets my use case?"

Is someone can help me to define what’s the best 2021 in kind crypto yield platform?

- I do not want to block my crypto for anytime. I want to be able to withdraw anytime 
- I do not care of the valuation of the company itself 
- I feel daily payment is a nice to have
- I m ok if it’s not the same yield regarding the crypto
- I’m ok to go with different platforms if it’s better paid

I have btc,eth, ada, theta, dot and usdc

It seems for me it is : 
1. Yield app (10% in kind)
2. SwissBorg (6% to 15% in kind more for stable coins yield)
3. Celsius network (4% to 14% in kind)

&amp;#x200B;

Is the following a good trading strategy?

&amp;#x200B;

At the start of the bull market I buy bitcoin. Then the Bitcoin bull market slows down and the """"altcoin season"""" starts. Right? 

&amp;#x200B;

When bitcoin peaks, and starts to go down, the altcoins peak a little later, because altcoins peak after Bitcoin's peak. correct?

&amp;#x200B;

When bitcoin peaks and starts to go down I am holding altcoins and realize it's time to sell because we are reaching the peak.

&amp;#x200B;

Is the following a good exit strategy?

&amp;#x200B;

When it's time to sell my altcoins I transfer them all to a cryptocurrency exchange, and exchange them for fiat, because altcoins are reaching their peak, and bitcoin is on its way down. So it doesn't make sense to convert directly to bitcoin, correct? 

Or should I convert to a stablecoin like DAI? Which is the best stablecoin? What advantages do stble coins offer?

&amp;#x200B;

Once bitcoin reaches its bottom more or less, and is in a more or less constant bear market I buy bitcoin again with the fiat money I have held in an exchange until that moment. correct?

Imagine another COVID crisis comes under Bitcoin standard. Countries must go to the commercial market to borrow the money, instead of just issuing debt. Safe to say, you’d never see a stimulus the size of the current one. Maybe countries like US would be able to borrow the same amount, since they’re “good for it”, but imagine Argentina.

I have seen so many posts get degraded because they sold their bitcoin to purchase a house, pay off their debt, or even to just indulge on their gains.

What I am trying to iterate is that just because you sold all or a portion of your bitcoin allocation, it doesn’t mean you can’t get back in again and continue to HODL.

Paused for a second and remembered that I also made a wallet that same day with him. My decorative wallet (which still has the forked coins in it) was also swept on January 2020. I'm pretty sure this was part of the bitcoinpaperwallet.com hack.  Point being is that these wallets were made in 2013 LONG before the last person sold it to the current owner. The fact that the code existed to sweep our funds back then makes me suspect that the OLD owner is actually the culprit here and should be prosecuted. I see my funds were swept together with his in the same transaction... I generated the wallets at the same time so I think the way this works is their bot is sweeping all private keys from each day in the past and keeping them locked in a multi-sig account. I see that those funds when swept remained in the address as and unspent output so the attacker still holds access to the coins - its just a matter of verifying the original owner... the person saying the new owner is

I'm not sure that matters any differently... the malicious code existed within the website  from the older operator, that means it was likely the older operator who is the culprit here."

Put off that new iPhone, car, PlayStation, 👜, whatever.

Rent somewhere cheaper (if it’s safe, don’t sacrifice your safety for money).

Eat more vegetables and less meat (cheaper and better for you and the environment)

Switch your phone plan to a non premium carrier without unlimited data. Use more WiFi.

Cut your auto insurance rate if you have a car by shopping around or reducing the miles you drive or both.

Buy no random stuff. Only buy things you can express a true need for.

Make your food at home, stop buying food out and use only the necessary ingredients. Rice is cheap and so are oats, beans, eggs/egg whites and veggies.

Make sure you’re only carrying one tv streaming service.

Get out of credit card debt completely (interest rate is too high) and if you can’t control credit card spending, put limits on your card. Consider a balance transfer to a 0% apr card if you have too much debt to pay off.

If you have not gone to college, advance your education at a local community college. Don’t do this until you are ready to work your hardest to get good grades. You can’t unfuck your transcript, so treat it carefully.

If you don’t like school, pursue a trade like plumbing or electricians
 apprentice or general contracting/carpentry. 

Get in shape! Health care is expensive and the less you need to use it, the better.

I’m a bit concerned because while her mind is gone her body is in good shape. If she lives more than 4-5 years she will be broke.

I saw a youtube video by Cold Fusion on Youtube that talked about Satoshi Nakomoto and the """"civil wars"""" within Bitcoin. It seems to me alot of these have to do with blocksizes which place a limit on the number of transactions that can be processessd. 

What if you were able to store transactions off chain in a distributed manner in a way that would allow you to put all transactions in a given time period in a file, compute the """"signature"""" of that block and just put that signature on the block?

The idea I had was to use something like FileCoin and have their storage providers to store transaction data off chain. That way blocksizes on Bitcoin could be kept to a minimum. Which I think would help increase transaction speed because the data would get spread across faster.  You would basically sepearate the ledger and the verification of it into 2 diff systems."

1502,"1. Fiat currency moves economy because people have to spend or invest their money for it to not lose value (inflation). If your money gains value as a result of deflation, people will hold on to it. And that will slow down the economy.

Therefore, wouldn't use of bitcoin as currency slow down the economy?

2. If bitcoin gains value as time goes on, it's a better means of storing value than using it as currency. Is bitcoin more of a commodity than currency?

3. Bitcoin is a threat to the foundation of government and Federal Reserve. You're basically taking away governments power to manipulate economy and print money. What do you think the odds of politicians letting that happen are? Like in a future where most money is bitcoin, the fed is no longer needed. My thoughts are politicians will not let that happen.

1510,"Forgive my lack of understanding - I’m here to learn.

From what I understand, Bitcoin is first and foremost a alternative solution to centralised currency, and its purpose is to be used for transactions (not as an investment). But the reality is that most Bitcoin is just held as investment and trading. Whilst this is just my assumption, I would say a very low % is being used for actual purchases. With this in mind, what’s the point? Where’s the value?

Surely if it’s not being used as currency (for the most part) then in reality it has no value (or is just heavily overvalued).

In addition to this, the transaction times for Bitcoin make it (in my opinion) a pretty shit option for transactions, as it is inherently volatile and by the time a transaction has been processed it could well have lost 5% in its value. If you’re making big purchases - that’s pretty messed up. So with other crypto currencies that have much faster processing times it poses the question again, why is Bitcoin considered most valuable?

Would appreciate anyone explaining it to me like I’m a 5 year old."

1537,"For example instead of just computing a large ass number, use all that processing power to simulate protein molecules or something, now i see the issue is 'how do you define a 'winner' of the block then?' simple answer have a much smaller number to calculate initially one that takes barely any time, use that to dictate who confirms the block and use the excess processing power for other shit, blocks still take about 10 minutes to mine, most people are unaffected because the difference between calculating a 25 and 30 digit number although significant isn't likely to change statistics wise, a processer that computes the key 60% of the time when it's 30 long will also probably win 60% of the time when it's 25 long at some point it stops being processing power and just becomes random chance as large mining pools emerge, i believe bitcoins reached that point so instead of wasting as much energy as argentina on completely useless calculations, reduce the initial calc and use the excess processing to do something useful. 

You probably can't have it all based on useful processing because then you don't get a block winner, and the only solution would be equal block distribution which would dilute the reward so much it would be useless so keep the fundemental system the same, but instead of scaling the processing input with large numbers scale it by selling processing power and add that processing requirements to the block reward, let's say a lab really needs some stuff processed, it puts in 0.1btc as payment and tens of thousands of high end PCs smash through their equations, repeat a few hundred times, the block reward gets a little bigger, scientists get necessary computing power, energy isn't just wasted mining bitcoins and it becomes far more mainstream as it's actually useful and respected.

Win, win, win, win everything basically operates the same although it might take a bit to get the infrastructure in the bitcoin network, various websites that do this (distribute complex processing among thousands of computers) already exist so you could borrow some of the modes they use. 

'but won't miners just switch off their rig when the blocks been mined and not participate'

Not if you don't reveal who wins till the time limits up and randomise when the actual block is mined, it might be hard to hide what people are actually computing and I'm not entirely sure of a solution around it but it probably exists.

The current housing crisis shines a light into btc.

There is zero supply pressure to sell homes. You can be behind on your mortgage and you don't get evicted. Though many people care and would sell, the vast majority in this position will not IMHO.

So, there's no supply. That should move the price a bit. But where is the demand coming for?

Low rates? I'd say this contributes, as payments are important

Millennials who got shut out and/or lost their home in 08-11 and now are back on their feet? Yes, some of them.

What's the most? Simple. Homes are the easiest and simplest asset to buy if the fear of inflation exists. This is even if the buyer is unaware of inflation. Why? Because of leverage. You're able to use a small amount today to BET on the future devaluation of the currency over the next 30 years at a fixed payment/rate. You would not buy a home if you think the value of currency goes up. It is also the easiest asset for someone to buy that fears inflation as they can say """"have to live somewhere"""". This is much softer than a bet on bitcoin. The more you think inflation rises, the faster you want to buy. Cash is quick becoming trash.

Now, let's look at bitcoin. 

More people and institutions can buy bitcoin than real estate. You can't buy a house with $3,000. You can buy some btc exposure. You can easily buy $300,000,000 of bitcoin. Click a button and off to cold storage. Good luck doing that in under 6 months for real estate. 

21 million, but most likely about 3 million lost so 18 million. EVER.

Unlike cycles before, sellers are buying in bigger values and are not trading. Massachusetts mutual is not flipping their BTC.

Inflation is getting lit on fire from two angles-money supply AND supply shocks from covid. 

What happens on the day when 1 million americans see their friends making $ and decide they need 1/2 a btc? That's 500,000 bitcoin.

How about when 10,000,000 people in the world rush to buy?

This is unlike anything I have ever seen. It makes sense. Lordy help us this bull run."
1567,"Hello Reddit!  New to the r/Bitcoin (and new to reddit for the most part) - this question has been on my mind lately and figured it might make for a good initial post. What's stopping a developer from coming along and creating something that consumes less energy, has higher transaction speeds and a fixed supply to compete with or surpass bitcoin?"
1568,The more upset I get about the fact I bought .25 bitcoin back in 2018 and half of it my boyfriend lost while transferring it around and the other half he got us scammed out of last year. I held onto that shit for a long time hoping I'd recoup what I spent at least and thinking about how much money I could have right now when I REALLY fucking need it is so frustrating to me. Def the worst part about bitcoin is once it's gone theres no way to get it back really.

1583,"It's surreal.. sometimes I just stare at today's Bitcoin news feeds in a haze of euphoric disbelief.  Convinced we're living in some parallel phantasy where dreams can actually come true..  

The Bitcoin journey must be the craziest, wildest, euphoric and most beautiful rides that most hodlers will be  privileged to have been a part of.

From Satoshi to each and every single one of us that's followed.. we've all played our part in turning the dream in to a reality.

Personally l feel honored and blessed to not only have been alive to witness but also to have played a small part in line of history's greatest revolutions.

Many movies of this moment in history will be made and we will all be the stars.

It's crazy to think that after two world wars, humanity can unite in such a magnificent way and turn the hopes and prayers of the few in to the future salvation of so many.

To all the new-coiners that aren't there already,  I really hope that someday you'll also be able to look back and marvel at the beautiful path you took, proud of the part you played and moved by the legacy you've helped create.

1587,"Okay, just a quick rundown for anyone who's curious about doing this (as I was). 

I live in a small mountain town and noticed the Coinstar at the local grocery store lets you exchange cash for BTC. I make cash tips at my job, so I thought this might be a good way to stack a few extra sats. 

I go through the motions on the machine until it tells me to start inserting my cash ($120). Immediately I notice that the exchange rate is much higher than the current price of BTC (at about $63k instead of $59k). Oh well, no big deal, I continue. 4% transaction fee as well? Whatever, fine. Once I get my voucher I have to verify my identity in order to claim my BTC. Again, sure, no big deal I suppose. Finally get everything squared away and receive my sats! (Now worth about $108 after fees) 

Okay, time to move them into my cold wallet as part of the final test. Just another $11.26 in fees to make that happen. Uhh, well damn. After everything was said and done (buying, receiving, and sending to my cold wallet), my $120 is now worth about $97, the price of BTC before and after staying just about the same. 

Feels good to turn my funny paper into some solid sats, but I don't think I'll be doing that again any time soon. Coinbase fees almost seem generous after this experience."

I’ve done this successfully many times, with the most recent one being a conversion of 1k in Bitcoin into Filecoin when they were 30 apiece and Bitcoin was pretty stagnant. Filecoin boomed to over 200 apiece and I converted what was now about 7k right back into Bitcoin.

2. I have a BTC wallet that shows a ton of transactions and a decent account balance at one point. I don't recall ever having this much BTC, but who knows. All the transactions are from 2013 and show as """"0/unconfirmed, not in memory pool"""" -- how can I unfreeze these or generally get the BTC back if it's tied up somewhere? Any way to tell where I sent it?  It's possible it's floating around on an exchange somewhere.

Yet, when Bitcoin reached $50k he was able to pay off his entire mortgage (but he hasnt sold yet he held on to his dear old sweet Bitcoins). He felt much more secure and after a night out with some good surf and turf at a fancy restaurant candle light dinner style with several bottle of reds, he and the wife just went the whole nine yard.

And just right now he told me his wife is pregnant! I am about to become an uncle. This is all thanks to Bitcoin!

The Whitepaper is available over here: [https://gridnet.org/](https://gridnet.org/)

We've just launched the very first game, reassembling the mechanics of the retro 'Snake' game.

  
You may play it over any SSH client. On Windows we recommend 'Putty', on Android 'Termion'  seems to get the job done.

The game supports both single-player and multiplayer modes.

Once you login into OS type

1) 'snake' - for single-player  
2) 'snake -m' - for multiplayer

The game supports automatic matchmaking.

Now the coolest thing? After the weekend you'll be earning real cryptocurrency rewards for playing the game. Reward in Multiplayer will be double.

Let us know what you think, looking forward to your opinions and ideas.

The next thing in terms of games we'll be implementing is a Minecraft-like game where you build an entire world which gets stored on blockchain. More on that later.

If one of them bankrupts is there going to be a string of defaults, and retail investors will get screwed. Particularly they are lending on big chunks in crypto to institutional firms, if one of those institutions defaults, how will they pay back their deposits?

In a regulated bank environment, lenders hold capital with the central bank, and the central bank will likely intervene to rescue the retail depositors. So regulators check the risk system of lenders/banks and make sure they are able to keep up with the possible stresses. 

I don't think any crypto lending firm is regulated, isn't this risky? If the lending business grows very large in a risky mannger, could it even damage the whole cryptocurrency reputation."

Due to the fact that Bitcoin is 100x superior to the legacy fiat money in it's ability to move at higher speed(velocity) through economic and commercial cycles and national borders, to transfer value by orders of magnitude, a USD equivalent amount of Bitcoin will touch the wallet of more people in a shorter amount of time, giving the users of it the impression of less scarcity of money.

To my understanding these two option are effectively equivalent in terms of market expose except for a few point.

Margin:
- risk holding my Bitcoin on exchange 
- trading fees

Defi Loan:
- borrow APY interest
- maximum borrow value of 75% of collateral
- having to use wrapped btc

I am not sure how liquidation would work for each platform.

For exampke if I had a margin trade with 2x leverage and the price of Bitcoin dropped at what point would I be liquidated? How does this work on the defi platforms?

When it began to be noticed at the beginning of its existence, and investors saw opportunities in it, other cryptocurrencies were created in its wake. They tried to ultimately solve various problems and shortcomings that were noticed in the bitcoin network. As we can see, most of them ended with a poor result, and only some of them managed to break through on the market.

What problems were identified with the Bitcoin (BTC) network?

“One of the downsides of Bitcoin (BTC) that is often blamed on it is its lack of anonymity. Although the addresses between which we send our funds are difficult to assign to a specific person, we can track in detail what amounts are transferred between them, at what time, and how often the transaction takes place. ” – Said Tomasz Kabarowski, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange office

If you happen to use CBW as I do and cannot transfer over 5K in a month I have found a resolution. I must emphasize that had I not had 2 phones I would have possibly lost my wallet so please ensure you have the recovery phrase in an accessible place (secure as well).

To do unlimited transfers, simply delete the app and re download it. Each time you install the app back (for me at least), it refreshes the $5000 monthly limit. This will allow you to transfer as much as needed in a short(er) period of time.

Aware some people have better wallet options, please feel free to recommend to people. I have not tried any other than CBW.

Hopefully this helps someone.

Thanks."

Goldin, which is known for high-value items, including a Lebron James rookie card that sold for $1.8 million last year, decided to accept Bitcoin and Ether based on “demand from consumers,” says Ross Hoffman, Goldin’s chief executive officer.

“Look, we think a big macro theme that we’re seeing is folks that are hedging,”  he continues. “One, against inflation, and two, there’s interest in alternative investing.” Crypto currency and sports collectibles, Hoffman concludes, have “a pretty large overlap.”

I thought to bring them the solution of an ATM so they can slowly start understanding of cryptos and what btc is..

GreyScale, a digital currency investment platform, has about 65,166 BTC \[about 3% of total bitcoin supply\] under its management, while, Microstrategy, a prominent business analytics company, holds 71,079 BTC

Such investments from major companies are already causing a massive interest amongst investors to stock their money in bitcoin and it's likely to continue through 2021. Now, add this to the FOMO that is already generated with the latest bull run and investments news.

**Competition from Big Tech:**

Tech companies have had their eyes on cryptocurrency for a long time. Facebook launched Libra a few years which went bust and is not getting relaunched as Diem.

Google as well is said to open its doors to cryptocurrency with multiple projects in the development phase. Will it accept bitcoin is still unknown.

**Price Increase:**

With such a massive interest from investors both institutional and retail bitcoin price is likely to increase at least for the next couple of months.

No one can ever rightly predict what will happen with bitcoin price but the trend does look optimistic.

**Regulations are coming:**

With bitcoin gaining popularity in the institutional space, regulations are expected to follow.

Such regulations will not just be implemented to safeguard people’s digital assets but also to pave the path for current institutions, financial or otherwise, to embrace the technology and develop upon it.

1714," Hello everyone!  
I am going to mine using 20 PC's they are actually gaming PC's for a gaming network.  
I am wondering which are the best programs to mine with? How to calculate the electricity usage. Also will I be using more actual electricity than I already use since the PC's are active for gaming? I am made some calculations and I am aiming to mine Ethereum, any other suggestions?  
I need help in calculating the income of each PC, and whatever tips/advices that are possible, thank you in advance!

1715,"As the title says, I made a mistake and sent my 1 BCH from my ledger nano x, to my BTC wallet address on coinbase, and it obviously doesn't show it now. I contacted coinbase and even tho they clearly have access to my BTC private key, and should be able to see that there is 1 BCH sent to the BTC blockchain, they say they can't help me.  


Is there really no way to ever get that 1 BCH back? I have checked the blockchain and found my BTC wallet, showind 1 BCH in it, but coinbase won't let me send it back, as I can't even see it showing up on  my page.  


I beg you, amazing people on reddit, is there any way some of you know if there is anything I can do?"
1716,"Alright, so a long time ago I posted this thread where Aantonop makes a comparison between LN and the early days of the internet (roughly 3 minutes long): https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cdadss/even_andreas_antonopoulos_makes_the_comparison/                          

So we sent four transactions between us. Screenshot of transactions (for clarity, the first time you open a channel it costs like 1000 sats, but that is a price I'm willing to pay to introduce bitcoin to other people):

First question: I'm just curious, why is it that when he sent me transactions his fee was 20x higher than mine? Don't get me wrong this is only pennies, but I'm wondering why his fee to send it to me was higher?             

Second question: How will taproot improve this? It's already amazingly fast in my opinion.             

Third question: If memory serves correctly lightning network opens up some applications for smart contracts... is that true?"
1717,"Right? You can't track it so you can't enforce taxes. And without taxes – well, there's no government. An alternative is a voluntary participation, like charity. I don't know... People underestimate the disruptive potential of that technology. And there might occur a real turmoil in the process.

I'm a personally a libertarian, probably like most people here, so the idea of a civilized anarchism excites me. Let's hope it *will* be civilized."
1718,"In a perfect ungreedy world Satoshi nakamoto found the way. Finally since the bartering times from the tribes of mesopotamia, somebody found a decentralized way of trading and owning completely an economic asset. Finally the unfairness of being born in a country with corrupt politicians, unstable economic systems and little opportunities, could be equalized around the world. Finally the people could take ownership of their money.

But this is not a perfect world, and as much as we complain of the governments, politicians, wall street... We are no much better than them. If just a 10% (random unproved statistic:)) of the people in the cryptoworld were here for the """"cause"""" and not for greedines, we would not have had so many huge blood baths in the past, so much volatily and instability in the market. This alt season is proving me right. New coins coming up, with almost no development, are mooning, while much more mature projects with many developers and people backing them up are stuck. We are making the same mistake as in 2014 and 2018, and we will get the same result. It does not take only one visionary to change things. We need to open our eyes too and not only our pockets."

1722,"In the weekly report or whatever, the authorities stressed on the new banning of any digital currency in my country.

Claiming they want the safety of the citizens as digital currency is too """"dangerous"""".

Dangerous because its price fluctuates every day aaaand wait for it... they can't have a system that applies taxes on digital currency earners.

So it was banned instead and any trader/miner will be subject to prison and a huge fine if found guilty!

1723,"According to data from CB Insights, in the first quarter of this year, 129 startups focusing on blockchain digital technology around the world raised a total of approximately US$2.6 billion, surpassing the entire year of 2020. In 2020, startups in this field had raised $2.3 billion in 341 venture capital investments.

　　 This growth was driven by several rounds of large-scale financing of startups, including crypto lender BlockFi, game developer Dapper Labs, and crypto wallet provider Blockchain

　　 With the price of Bitcoin hitting a record high, and companies such as Tesla (661.75, -6.18, -0.93%) investing heavily in the world's largest digital currency, Bitcoin financing has also surged.

　　 Also, Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, is planning a direct listing, which may make many early investors earn a lot of money and encourage more venture capital to enter the field."

1726,"So I have some questions 
There seems to be very little info on this fast developing industry of bitcoin mining 

So they make money by mining coins ! 

Now question is what happens at halving? Their profits halve too? 50% stock dump? 

#2 what happens if bitcoin goes to 150k and back to 60k is it possible for these stocks to be higher at that point ? So my question is , is this a bitcoin tracker or a company that makes profit so let's say bitcoin stays flat for 1 year (imagine)will the miners still go up since they are racking in profit all this time ? Or will they stay flat too 

Summary 
Halving?
Profit machine or bitcoin tracker?"
1727,I saw that FTX.com allows lending but I couldn't find it under FTX.US.  Any other good places where one can lend BTC that are reliable companies?
1728,"Does anyone have any idea what the UK tax treatment is on any of Ledn’s services?

Scenario 1: Savings account - 1BTC earning 6% received monthly. Is this taxable as interest? Or is it only subject to CGT when you sell?

Scenario 2: B2X - 1 BTC is used as collateral to borrow another 1 BTC, which Ledn purchase on your behalf. This creates an open ended loan valued in USD e.g $50k. If BTC goes up and you settle the loan you receive the additional BTC gains less fees. Are there taxable gains at any point so far? This is similar to borrowing on margin right?"
1729,"Not investment advice.

Right now if you are a bitcoiner you probably think: I kind of get it or I get it.

If you a pure speculator that's bullish, you might think I don't agree with it, but I won't fight a crowd.

The reason most are not involved is because it forces them to fake an uncomfortable set of realities. We are getting a look under the hood-and we don't like what we see. Most people do NOT want to think/talk about this.

1. The American political system is beyond repair. It's dysfunctional and polarized to the point of all votes being along party lines. Party dissent is getting less common. This is not good.
2. We cannot stop printing for years to probably forever. We can and will slow down but we won't stop, we must print. We must incur deficits. Even in a recovered economy, a trillion yearly deficit is common. 
3. Europe-no one knows how bad the problems really are. Could be not a huge problem, could be massive.
4. Either the companies and people buying or they are smarter than us and see something coming. This is 08 part 2 and the smart people see the wreck coming. Are the rich all in on the stock market?
5. The debt is going to hurt the 2022-2025 recovery. We must print more to counteract this. 
6. Massive wealth inequality is spreading. Poverty and violence are increasing. Homelessness is rampant. These are signs that point to destabilization.
7. Wages Increase/Cost of living Increase ratio. Anything under 1 means the person is getting poorer. This is rapidly going under 1 and closer to zero for a larger and larger part of society.
8. The only real avenue to stop this is cut expenses. There is nothing that can be cut significantly without a huge shock. 1/6 people work for the government. It costs $400,000+ to house a prisoner for 1 year in NYC.
9. The bond market is in serious trouble if inflation picks up. SERIOUS TROUBLE. Talking 50 trillion trouble. If this recovery is great for 3 months then crashes, a serious economic slow down will force a highly leveraged consumer and corporate borrower to default. The commercial real estate will implode. The government will have less revenues, and face a problem where printing goes insane. I'm talking one time check to everyone for $5,000 insane. I'm talking 0 down 40 year home loans waive 1/2 the pmi interest insane.
10. What's the chance the EU/Europe/China/Russia has a major conflict or a currency collapse. Will people dump treasuries? Find out on the next 6 months episodes of the world of tomorrow."

1735,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub to be asking, but I’m having issues with Coinbase. I’m a long time hodler and this will be my first time selling since late 2013. I made Coinbase account back in college, invested what I could and held through the roller coaster cycles 3+ times. I have plenty of BTC and I need some liquid cash for my business. 

It pains me to sell but I’ll still be hodling over 80% of my coins and plan to by back when I have good cash flow. My problem is with my Coinbase account(s).

I originally made 2 accounts, one with a school email and one with a personal. I was unable to link my bank with the personal so I used the school. Well flash forward 7.5 years later and I attempt to login to both. I successfully get into the personal and update the million personal verification questions they ask. 

Realizing I have no bank account linked to my personal and my old college email may still have what used to be a small amount of BTC, I try to login to it and eventually get in by submitting an email change. (I had loss access to the school email) That process went smoothly and I got into the account! To my surprise it has 7k usd on it and I got excited, since it was maybe 20 bucks back when I left it.

I maybe mistakenly verified this account with the same info as my other. I’m not sure if this was a mistake. But the verification passed and my limits are very high. However I cannot buy/sell or move my cold wallet BTC back onto the account!

I filled out a ticket 10 days ago and coinbase has yet to respond. I’m frustrated, but my question is what should I do? I’m not attached to these old accounts, but I feel like verifying both of them was a mistake. Can I make a new account with a new email and the same bank/personal information to sell my coins or will that be flagged?

Does anyone have any recommendations for other secure exchanges that will help my convert some of my BTC to usd? I’m not super time rushed but I need to find a solution within a few weeks. Sorry for the long post and for the sin of converting to fiat, but I’m a long time hodler who is just looking to cash in a small amount of what I’ve been hodling for many years."

I've been wanting to set my three boys each up a trust anyway. My thought was to take a little money each pay period, and add some sats to their wallet. In the event I pass, my assets would be liquidated, debts reconciled, and I'd want the remainder divided equally and placed in their wallets. 

I have no idea how this would work. I would be the trustee, unless something happens to me, then my atty becomes trustee? Who has the wallets? We'd obviously both have to have the seed phrases?

1748,"It's been 2 years since my first purchase of bitcoin and I always like to read stories of people's struggles and successes on here, so here's mine.  Don't worry, it's fairly short.

4/1/2019, I had been watching the price of bitcoin go up and down for two or three months now, finally got verified on coinbase, and made my first purchase.  0.02413919 BTC @ $4,136.78 or right around $100.  That's all I could spare at the time and I figured if I could trade it day by day and make something like +$20 from it, that's really the best I could ever ask for.

What happened next sent chills down my spine.  I had studied the charts and had watched the price for months thinking I'd be ready for anything bitcoin threw at me, but as I sat there on day 1 of my new adventure, I witnessed the price jump around 25% to $5,150 in a single night.  Of course the... whatever you want to call me... that I was, I sold rather early and missed out on a majority of that amazing jump.

About 2 months went by and I continued to buy and sell during this time, learning how to read the charts better and try to predict how to make an extra dollar (and how not to quickly lose several...)  Money got tight and I was ready to cash out.  Think I made a profit of $80 or so overall from day trading, so of course I was insanely pleased with my little experiment.

Hindsight is 20/20.  If I had just bought into bitcoin and held the entire time, I would have made something like 2.2x what I put in, instead of 1.8x.  If I had continued holding until today, it'd be closer to 14x if not a little higher...  Moral of the story?  HODL!!!  I'm just glad I was one of the fortunate few that was able to turn a profit on day trading.

Recently got back into bitcoin and looking forward to seeing where this technology goes from here.  Can't believe it's been 2 years, but at the same time I thought it'd take decades to get to the prices we're seeing right now.  Still can't say it's a great time for my wallet, but it's about time I jump back on the bitcoin rocket."

Im pretty new to this space (investing in general) but its been a lot of fun, I have learnt some basics and made some dumb decisions already so I just wanted to ask other analysts their views.

1753,"Hello,

I am a computer science student and I had an idea for a side project. We have hard wallets such as trezor or the nano ledger. These are essentially wallets which store the private key within the device.

I had an idea about making a bitcoin wallet which replicates this entire idea but instead uses your smartphone. The private key would be stored on device. Encrypted of course.

If the device is lost, it wallet can be recovered through a different mobile device using seed. (Same concept as the trezor)

Basically a trezor, but instead of a seperate device, your phone is the device. This is different from blockchain wallets or electrum wallets because with these wallets the private key is not stored on device. It is stored with your account and can be accessed via logging into your account. This concept is much different because the attacker would not be able to send bitcoin unless they have your seed phrase or your physical phone in hand (since private key is stored locally on device).

Has anything like this been created before?

If anyone is interested in a project like this. Please let me know. If you have IOS or Android development experience, we can collaborate.

Cheers."

Hi guys what’s going on. Recently I’ve been getting super addicted to crypto. I’m only 20 and don’t have a very high paying job but every 2 weeks just about every penny I earn goes into tokens. Im super new, only been in crypto for a couple months now but I’m obsessed and really want to learn more. I guess what I’m looking for is a link to a discord/Reddit/etc community that I can learn from. I have a good understanding of the basics like moving averages, rsi, volume and all those fundamentals. What I have a hard time with is finding gems before they blow, as well as when new coins are launching. I also don’t really have a strategy. I just buy low and hodl but I just really want to get more informed. I want to get serious with crypto and I’m hoping for some like minded individuals that could point me in the right direction. I have no problem with subscribing to a patreon or something like that, but I don’t want any “moon 100000x” bullshit I keep seeing. I’m looking for a realistic, transparent community where I can learn and discuss. If anyone’s interested or has any tips, that would be much appreciated. Thank you"

1789,"Account has now been frozen since February 12th 2020, 48 days by u/Paxful.   The amount of time that has passed and the lack of any customer service and outright disregard this company uses on their customers is really unheard of.  In my opinion what they are doing is illegal, while they may have the right to take over and freeze an account for reasons defined within their TOS, The are not following these rules   Paxful will turn around and freeze or ban your account watthour any notice, and when they deem its fit, then they won't even give you a REASON AS to WHY they froze your money.    

&amp;#x200B;

Are you kidding me?   I had a very large amount of coin frozen by this company.   I was within my limits I was VERFIED for on u/paxful's website.  I have all of my verifications completed with u/paxful for a while now, its not like I was a new account just joining,  I have been here for a while and fully verified to do transactions up to $50,000.    And I have operated on u/paxful's website for a long time and completed many successful trades and have not had any customer issues or bad deals, all of my transactions completed successfully and everyone was happy in the end..  no complaints....

&amp;#x200B;

I have emailed and emailed and emailed and chatted the chat bot on the site.. I've sent twitter messages out plenty of times only to be met with the exact same response.   On top of that, it took 3 WEEKS!!!!   Yes 3 WEEKS for Paxful to respond back to my initial question of what happened, and why was my account now frozen..  So imagine walking into a Walmart, and they for some reason frisked you before going in, they find a couple of bitcoins on you.   They take them away and leave to the backroom and you don't hear a word from them,   Then 3 weeks later they say you're accounts frozen and send this half ass response with it, or to any of your future messages asking with they are doing:

&amp;#x200B;

""""Please be advised that we are doing our best to complete the review as soon as we can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once the review is complete, we will definitely reach out to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

We ask for more patience and understanding at this time.""""

Absolutely no response from a company that in my eyes just stole a significant amount of money from me and failing to comply with their reporting compliances.   

&amp;#x200B;

The only other addition I have received from Paxful was a note that they would be sending me weekly updates, which they have failed to do so at this point, they have sent me a total of 3 responses so far since this happened, all centering around the snippet above.

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked multiple times over and over for their contact information, physical mailing address so I can get a certified letter sent to them but they ignore this request every time..

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest to everyone to never ever use u/paxful again if you value your money and sanity, because to me it looks like this will find any way possible to take your money when there's enough of it out there...

&amp;#x200B;

u/paxful, I want my ticket or review or whatever the hell you guys are doing to get closed up or processed faster there's no reason any incidents should take more than 48 hours to complete.   I have told you I want my account closed from you I just want to withdraw my coin. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's no reason for u/paxful to continue reviewing whatever they are reviewing... Just close my account out and enable my withdraw please.

&amp;#x200B;

I am beyond frustrated and I really need access to my funds to survive.  So please the faster you can wrap all this up the better..

1799,"There are a lot of arguments on how bitcoin’s technology will disrupt the current financial system and help people. Moreover how difficult it will be for government to shut it down (or control). I would like to explore those topics and open for discussion.

1. Too much focus on technology.
Bitcoin’s technology is impressive similarly to the internet. Internet too was heralded as end of dictatorial power and booster for democracy, civil society and freedom. There were articles saying how free expression on the internet will make any propaganda or social control nearly impossible... and for the first few years it did. Then governments quickly repositioned and now internet is used as a tool for the greatest social control that ever existed in human history. Governments can choose which companies, voices, information are shared, with whom and in what context. They can also track everything about everyone like never before. The technology that was meant to be the biggest equalizer of power and society, became the biggest amplifier and protector of the same power.
Bitcoin (and most crypto) is similar, we might think that it will make the current financial system obsolete but the fact that it helps bring cash (and gold) down, while dealing purely in digital form makes it easily traceable (and even if people use mixers it won’t help much, same as VPNs don’t in terms of internet usage if government really wants to track you). Anyways in terms of money/store of value technology is only enabler the real maker-or-breaker is trust.

2. Shift from technology focus to trust focus.
Everything about money is about trust. You trust that your bank doesn’t block your money, you trust land registry that they don’t mess the ownership of your house, you trust your broker/custodian that the shares you buy are really in your name and not some paper/fake account, you trust that gold you have in vault is still there and that it was original in the first place. Everything about money is about trust. Bitcoin is the same, people need to trust in miners supporting the system, in wallets holding their BTC, in merchants accepting the BTC, in researches explaining how BTC technology works and many more. We tend to think that Bitcoin is trustless, but nothing about money/value works without trust. In Bitcoin you don’t need to know the 3rd party to transact but you need to trust the “Bitcoin ecosystem”. The impressive and growing trust in Bitcoin is the main reason for its valuation. Arguably there are coins with more sophisticated technology, but none of them can match Bitcoin’s trust.

3. Bitcoin’s biggest vulnerability is trust
There is an argument that Bitcoin cannot be controlled (or “stopped”) by government because of its decentralized technology. However we all know the history of gold confiscation in US, and what was more decentralized than individuals owning shining rock in their basement without any central ledger... and yet gold was blocked by US government. The same approach could be used to Bitcoin- if government wishes (it is unlikely - but that is topic for another discussion:)). Let’s explore and discuss how “ban” on Bitcoin could play out (or why it would fail).
If government would want to ban Bitcoin it would aim at its trust (and convenience):
- First offer good sum to buy it back legally (most people would go for it).
- Then offer bounties for friends and hackers to report illegal holders. This breaks trust as even if you want to send money in underground economy you can never be sure that the other person is not govt agent.
- Thirdly they ask ISP, VPNs, Apps providers and exchanges to share all data on people owning crypto apps or visiting websites (then they can target them with the under cover solicitation).
- Moreover if still some people are expected to transact in BTC but won’t come up (somehow) in any of the above steps, you designate an IRS agent to look after their statements for any discrepancies. 
Again you don’t need to crack technology you just need to break the trust. Of course people can transfer/spend their BTC oversees (same as gold was moved to let’s say Switzerland). But then still you need to find a place that accepts it, trust that it is not working with the “wrong govt” and even then it will only be small percentage of mostly already wealthy people (again same as in gold seizure history).



Bonus thought experiment, how government could crash Bitcoin to discourage its usage while actually looking as a savior:
- Firstly you need alibi, so you say you are against Bitcoin. People advocate for it, so you “let them win”, barely approving it, but never too explicitly. “You let them have it if they want it” but still advice caution and rather against it.
- Then you create context/rules that push into Bitcoin, e.g. print money, inflate assets, leave no alternative for investment while requiring (pension funds) to deliver greater returns. Gradually more big investors move into it, you as government repeat step 1, discouraging them, but keeping the rules that force this move anyway.
- Thirdly biggest ever bull market ensues, bigger that Mississippi company, South Sea company and dot.com all combined. Then you change rules, be it tighten rates or regulation, put limits etc. implicitly you force selling, insiders exit first, pensions and retail are left holding (especially as exchanges crash due to traffic and limits on trades) and since markets tend to overextend the crash is spectacular.
- You come to “save” the situation, saying that technology is great but it needs greater oversight (internet history likes to repeat itself). You say you will leverage the technology, but “improve” oversight and trust by centralizing crypto under Central Bank Digital Currency. Moreover since people lost all of their savings and retirement, you propose to reimburse them with CBDC (aka digital dollars), of course not fully, since they need to learn the lesson... maybe instead of pension accounts that are crashed you offer Universal Basic Income, paid in (you guessed it) Digital Dollar. Even better, you program how people can spend those DD (Digital Dollars), so no more spending stimulus checks on stocks and crypto (which are down after our hypothetical crash) but you only can spend it on food and rent, and even cannot save it, since at the end of each month the DDs disappear. You achieved full control of fully dependent society, and they even thanked you along the day.

Enough of day dreaming, let’s hear what you think."

1809,"First off, I don’t want to seem like the usual ‘ogga booga whats the best exchangering?!?’ guy out there on Reddit. Here’s a serious question for once because being a Canadian in the crypto market sucks ass: 

I’m looking for an extremely low fee FIAT on-ramp, exchange and off-ramp. I’m using Coinbase Pro at the moment but 0.5% taker/maker fees are near criminal! As a Canadian, I can only fiat on-ramp thru the generic Coinbase platform at a ridiculous ~ 10% (for a 300$ purchase) and tranfer that money to Coinbase Pro because Coinbase Pro itself does not support CAD (CND)

Looking around, Binance and Bybit either don’t support CAD (CND) or lack the fiat off-ramp I need. I don’t want to trade on these platforms and then fiat off-ramp with a transfer to Coinbase either because although the &lt;0.065 maker/taker fees and ~6% fiat on-ramp fees sound delicious, transfer fees on especially small transactions take a good hunk out my profit margins! I need preferably a platform that doesn’t require this.

Just another concerned small-time Canadian looking for the best options. As another small-timer in crypto, I’m sure you understand that every dollar counts in my world!

But for me, one of the most important approvals to BTC came from the academy, from Niall Ferguson, a pundit author dedicated to study the money and its history throughout the ages. He is author of """"the Ascent of Money"""", one of the most interesting books which breakdowns what the money is and how it has evolved.

Niall's trajectory includes being a professor in economics at Oxford, Harvard and Stanford, among other relevant positions. Therefore, for me, the fact that Bill Gates, Warren Buffett or other relevant characters in the financial world have not approved BTC (yet...) is inconsequential, if one of the real experts of money has backed BTC.

If you are interested to hear him, obviously I recommend you to read """"The Ascent of Money"""" and see/read the following podcast and publication. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeV3LCovV4w&amp;t=86s https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-29/bitcoin-and-china-are-winning-the-covid-19-monetary-revolution

That being said, hear me out....  


I'll say it now: i think Saylor will dump a significant amount of BTC (within the next 3 - 4 years). I write this as a fun sort of timestamp for myself, and to test a belief (feel free to set a reminder in 3 years and call me out if he hasn't sold a large majority for whatever reason). I can't read the future, i'm happy to admit that. But Saylor can't either, and neither can you.  


Simply put, I  see a lot of people beginning to follow his words as gospel. I've seen on far too many occasions people on this forum using phrases like 'It's guaranteed to go up!' and 'The charts SHOW this will hit 500k!' To those people putting dangerous levels of their savings into BTC i'd ask them to take a step back and not get too hasty.  


Saylor seems like a really smart guy, and I'd guess he's a few steps ahead of the average buyer.   


Yet, I do not see him hodling forever as much as he likes to proclaim in his thousands of interviews he has pumped out over the last few months. Nothing wrong with that of course; he is a businessman after all.  


But for those already getting angry and downvoting me into oblivion, really, ask yourself, why is he doing so many interviews? Why does he need to promote it so much?   


If he is truly as confident in BTC being a superior product, THE ultimate coin superior in every way, then why must he constantly give it that much coverage..?   
''Oh, that's simple!"""" you say. """"It's because he believes in it and is proud of his holdings! It's because he wants others to see the light! Duhhh!""""   
Maybe. Who knows. Maybe it's all of the above.

But many are forgetting or are newer to Crypto not realizing the Bear markets / huge dips that many of us dealt with for many years!   I can easily say now that sure I knew exactly what the market would do after it already happened, and **too many** negative, trolling **bullies are doing exactly that**.  After the Dec. 2017 ATH it was a **15 month bear market** down to **3k level**..  Investors (smarter then myself) primarily were day trading the consistent spikes always down at least 5% then up again, but long term price was going down with some flat cycles during that time..  No one knew for certain what the future held.  We had a short lived spike **4 months up to 14k** then **9 more months of a bear run** to **5k** range and lower at times.. **Now** we are in the almost **11 month bull market** and fighting the **60k level** but staying above 50k during dips and with a lot of positive news.   So sure **many are claiming to have had a crystal ball now**, but for so many of us **long term Hodlers** we were mostly hoping / believed in Bitcoin and investing safely only what we could afford to lose.  I for one am still in that mindset.  If everyone including the elite corporations were absolutely certain Bitcoin was going to 1 Million or even 300k they would be gobbling up to the 100k levels right now, **but they are NOT** which is why we are stalled at the 60k level.  So for those of us who have been in this for years, we are **waiting for DIP's** even at these levels and buying which has been a proven strategy.  I know many smart folks are trading in and out with the ups and downs as they were doing even in the bear runs and most are doing very well I hope.  For us slower in the head folks busy working, its safer to just buy dips and Hodl which has worked out very well for myself so far.

If enough people owned Bitcoin, and it hit 10 Million per coin at some point in the future, would everyone actually be any richer? or could it just cause massive inflation as people pulled their money out, and started to spend it. 

Like if somehow most of the adult population accross the world was somehow involved / owned some coin. and it hit 10 million, no one would be any richer, because eveyones money supply would have gone up roughly the same amount (If everyone was able to buy in at the same time/price).

upon some quick research its estimated that 1.3% of the world population owns some coin (possible 2020/2021 data), and likley even higher then that now. i know in the grand scheme of things 1.3 % isnt much and likely woulnt cause inflation because that spead accross different countrys.

1877,"Never.  """"Never Sell, Laura"""", he thundered at Laura Shin on the Unchained Podcast.   """"Would you sell running water in your house?  Would you sell having electricity?""""

This was in reference to MicroStrategy, his company.   I do not believe he was saying individuals should never sell.   After all, kids gotta go to college; you need a bigger house; retirement beckons.

But what about for MicroStrategy?  There are macro (general) and micro (specific to MicroStrategy) reasons when MicroStrategy might sell Bitcoin.   

From a macro perspective, Bitcoin must have achieved stability of exchange with fiat currencies.   This will occur when the price increase in Bitcoin starts matching the inflation rate of the fiat currency year after year.   This has nothing to do with new coins being mined.  The market already prices in mining and halving.

Another macro requirement is how many companies are holding bitcoin in their treasury accounts.  This not hedge funds investing, or companies holding it so they can allow their customers to buy and sell but rather conservative CFO's deciding Bitcoin is better than cash.  An even better signal of Bitcoin stability will be when companies start publishing their financial statements denominated in Bitcoin.  The final macro signal that Bitcoin has reached stability is when the NFL sets its Salary Cap in Bitcoin!

Just because Bitcoin meets the macro requirements, doesn't mean it's right for MicroStrategy to sell.   Once Bitcoin matches the inflation rate of fiat, that's basically a zero rate of real return.  Shareholders want real rates of return.  At this point, MicroStrategy will either: sell (or use) Bitcoin to invest in new profitable lines or business, or distribute the excess Bitcoin to shareholders.  Obviously, you always keep some as part of treasury management of a company to account for cash (Bitcoin?) flow, seasonal variation, and risk management.

So when might this all occur?   I don’t think it’s 100 years out, but it’s not next year either.   Possibly ten year?   Maybe.   That’s why I’m hodling."

I am a European customer and hold a British and Greek bank account (**£** and **€** respectively) and wish to buy low amounts of BTC without ID verification.

Binance says it lets you buy up to 2 BTC without ID verification. Unfortunately, when I try to top up my account with fiat first (in order to buy the aforementioned BTC), I'm stuck, as it's asking me to verify my ID in order to lift the limit. What is this? They will have me not verify ID when I withdraw BTC, but force me to when I actually pay for it? I don't get it.

Can you inform me which CEX's legitimately let you buy low amounts of BTC without ID verification? Low, as in, ~1,000-4,000 €/£ worth of BTC.

She said, “We sometimes use things like Bitcoin to pay for goods for the school, so we know how fast and easy it is and want our music students to be able to do the same.”

1887,"The sum on your bank account is not your money. Not your cash, not your money.
That takes a while for most people to fathom. That is how indoctrinated we are.

In fact, the bank can do whatever they want with the money you’ve given them. It is theirs now.

What you have is an IOU.
Except the IOU has no sum printed on it. The one that owes you money keeps track of the amount (because you don’t, right?)

So you don’t keep a ledger, and, in fact, I doubt you even have a printed IOU.

Buying btc from Robinhood is similar. Not your coins. What you have is an IOU.

Both of these can fail, get hacked or asked by governments not to pay to you.

You might have a system that works as an insurance against failures. Still you rely on the failing party to name the amount.

It is not ”money in the bank” it is ”the bank’s money” or ”Robinhood’s coins”."
1888,Now ban me you POS SOBs. I been in this game since 2012. Fuck what you've become.
1889,Once you get into bitcoin for about 4 years or so price becomes irrelevant. The ones typing about price are the first ones to sell if it dips and then they buy the top again. Just buy secure it and come back in a couple of years if you are scared that your investment is down 80% in dollars.

1896,"Hi everyone. 

I own a barbershop in U.K and I have now started to accept cryptocurrency as payments for haircuts. I have been doing this for years now but on and off, I always wanted to make it known to all customers that this is possible with the right cryptocurrencies. At the moment I am accepting only NANO due to its speed and fees compared to other cryptos. I use NANO's official app and the customers who would like to pay in crypto know about it. For other currencies like BTC, ADA, ETH etc.. I will be using my wallets like Atomic, Trust and or exchanges like [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) &amp; Coinbase. 

I have around 8 customers right now that pay only in crypto and hopefully there will be more. I charge £15 for a haircut but if you pay in crypto I lower it to £12. I have posters made for the shop so that when we re-open on 12th April all customers can see and hopefully start to look into investing and using crypto themselves. Bitcoin has changed my life, I bought my business and home because of it so I am always going to be a big fan.

1950,"The M1 money supply and its rapid growth has been a popular topic of discussion. Let's take a look at the M1 graph and dive deeper into what it means for Bitcoin:

https://preview.redd.it/kgwnc1q4bfq61.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d79a63b3737004f5033b18f79f690c06a720727

According to the Fed, the M1 Money Stock increased by \~$14.384 trillion over the last year. Therefore you may think that the total money supply increased by \~$14.384 trillion, but this is not the case. To understand this, we must first define the M0, M1, and M2 money types.

* M0 - Notes and coins in circulation (outside Federal Reserve Banks and the vaults of depository institutions) (currency)
* M1 - The M0 plus traveler's checks of non-bank issuers, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits (OCDs)
* M2 - The M1 plus savings deposits, time deposits less than $100,000, and money-market deposit accounts for individuals

We can see that by definition, the M0 money stock is included in the M1 money stock, which is in turn included in the M2 money stock. Let's go back to the graph, but this time we will add the M2:

*Processing img sug83qrw3gq61...*

Here we see the M2 money stock increased by only \~$4.196 trillion over the past year. If the M1 is included in the M2, how is it possible that an increase of \~$14.384 trillion is not reflected in the M2? The answer is: Money from the savings, time, and money-market deposits in the M2 can shift into the demand and checkable deposits in the M1. The savings, time and money-market deposits are not reflected in the M1, but are reflected in the M2. Therefore, when they shift into demand and checkable deposits, it causes the M1 to increase without affecting the M2. This would indicate that large institutions are moving money out of savings and into more liquid accounts. We can try to visualize this by adding it to our graph:

https://preview.redd.it/irw8mpv68gq61.png?width=969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28023ff6070a9fc06f4573dbce1c9c1ecb6f4710

Here we see new lines which I will explain. Belonging to M1 we have Total Checkable Deposits and Demand Deposits. Belonging to M2 we have Total Savings Deposits, Small Time Deposits, and Retail Money Funds. Some lines belonging to M2 should sharply turn down as the M1 Money Stock line shoots up. This would indicate money shifting. The lines for Retail Money Funds and Small Time Deposits don't appear to have caused the spike. However, when we look at the green line for Total Savings Deposits, something weird is happening. This line is labeled as DISCONTINUED and stops abruptly during the M1 spike in April 2020. I found this suspicious and started looking for the missing data. I stumbled across a YouTube video from December of 2020 with a Fed chart showing some of the missing data:

https://preview.redd.it/wuylztdbdgq61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0eda9166ce12d050eb6450435fbf60575517f7a

In this older chart, we see the line for Total Savings Deposits extends all the way into December 2020 and turns down sharply as the M1 Money Stock line shoots up. Why did the Fed remove this data in later charts? I do not have an answer for that question, but it does seem to explain the sudden rise in the M1 Money Stock.

So what does this all mean for Bitcoin? It means that just because the M1 Money Stock went up by \~$14.384 trillion, it does not mean that the Fed printed \~$14.384 trillion. Big money players are shifting from savings accounts to more liquid accounts. This shift could be an indication that big money no longer trusts savings accounts or they know about future savings regulations that we do not. This could be a flight away from USD and into hedge assets like gold and, you guessed it, Bitcoin. I am an amateur in macro economics. These are only my opinions and I look forward to reading comments from more educated users."
1951,"Would it be possible for us to essentially crowdsource every combination of the 6 digit code they are asking people to guess on April 1st? Basically each person gets 10 guesses and first person guesses 000001, 000002, 000003, and so on.

1952,"Back in 2015 I decided to pull my BTC out of coinbase and exported my passphrase and recovery key to a flash-drive which I lost. I still have my original computer where I exported the both files before I moved them to the flash-drive. 

I'm thinking that I might be able to do a data recovery of the file on the hard drive, but I'm not sure what to search for. I think I might have saved the passphrase on a txt file, but I don't know the length of the passphrase or the file name. 

Does any one know what is the file format the passphrase is exported from coinbase?  


I also found an .rtf file named recovery key with a sequence of numbers and letters like so :  

XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX  


Would that be the recovery key and all I need to find is the passphrase?

1959,"If America can beat China in the 21st century it will be through backing decentralized currencies. Not creating an American crypto. But backing Bitcoin or whatever coin they choose. It will keep China from dictating a world of centralized crypto currencies. 

If Powell or Yellen or Biden, backed Bitcoin as an entity, the  individuals who back decentralized currencies would reap the rewards. The residents and businesses will benefit, which benefits the country. If America and the Fed realize its strength resides with the freedom of the individual not the power of the state, Bitcoin will reign supreme and Chinese authoritarianism will never catch up.

This is important for all of us. I can't seem to find concise or simplified information on this.

Could you give a simple and short explanation on each. If we all share that information here, we can all learn from one another. This is super important.

If the write off occurred today for a loan of .04 BTC (on a 60 month loan), which has a current value of $2348, is my taxable (loss) event worth the amount I loaned in 2016 or the amount I should have recouped in 2021?"
1964,"One perceived advantage of bitcoins is their fungibility - ie their interchangeability and similarity. You don't need to worry about the provenance of your bitcoins - you just buy them and sell them. 1 BTC = 1 BTC, right?

**No**. This drastically oversimplifies the real situation. In practice, there are multiple coin tracking services (like [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/)) who exist to track the origins of your coins, and report on linkages with known stolen coins and bad actors. Big customers of Chainalysis include the IRS and the FBI. You get the picture. The fully open nature of the Bitcoin blockchain allows for tracking of every transaction. Once your bank or regulated exchange starts paying for coin tracking services (if it isn't already), then expect to start seeing demands for explanations of the history of your coins. These demands will be driven by AML regulations, and won't be optional. (eg [FATF travel rules](https://www.coindesk.com/evil-vasp-simulation-preps-crypto-exchanges-for-fatf-travel-rule))

At this point in time, the premium in price between clean bitcoins and tainted bitcoins is minimal or zero, but there have been instances when 'super clean' bitcoins have sold at a [much higher price](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/17/bidders-running-up-price-bitcoin-government-auction/) than the general market price.

So, what do people do with tainted coins? Most often, these are cycled through coin mixers to distort and confuse the provenance. This could be fairly effective if the liquidity in the coin mixing market was large compared to the number of tainted coins - but these mixing services really only exist to clean dodgy coins and so the quantity of clean and untainted mixable coins is often small.

Virgin coins are those which have just been minted by a miner in a coinbase transaction. Originally these were in blocks of 50 BTC per block, but after a few halvings this is now down to 6.25 BTC per block. These coins have a totally clean provenance and no history.

The wonderful [Andreas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0T49duRt74) suggested that miners can cleanse tainted coins in the following way: First the miners buy the dodgy coins - probably at a price discount from regular, non-tainted coins. Then when the miners are composing their blocks, they include transactions which **spend these coins as transaction fees**. All transaction fees in a block add to the coinbase reward to the miner. The end result is that the miner destroys the dodgy coins and ends up with newly minted virgin coinbase coins. Magic! 

Does anyone know whether miners are currently doing this?

If this method of coin cleansing becomes widespread, how will that affect the fungibility of Bitcoin?"

Hi guys!

I am just currious if anyone of you who have already been tried to buying stolen credit card on DeepWeb? Did they send you legit card after you paid them? Was the card having exactly funds that they were promised? Are you having any problem to using it or they will just ripped you off?

I know it is very stupid to asking thing like this. Because most of us already know that it is very small chance that they are real legit because if those card is really having that much money why don't they use it but sell it? I know you might said they don't want to risk it to use it. But from what I know if they are good enough to using deepweb to sell those stuff and I bet he will know how to use the funds without exploring his identity!

After all, I am just want to discuss about this. If you have a good story please drop it down. I will award it, let's just discuss about this interesting.

Or, I could use an actual exchange like Coinbase, though I previously had trouble with their verification/signup process so I'd probably prefer CashApp if possible - though I'm not sure which method, CashApp(?) or Coinbase, would be better.

If the above is possible, how much verification would CashApp need (e.g. ID, SSN, picture, etc.)?

1980,What you're staking is energy. The difference with Proof-of-stake is that what you're staking is independent from the value of the chain.   With Proof-of-stake you're staking Dingdong tokens and the value of your stake is dependent to the value of the dingdongs.  On the other hand each gigawatt of electricity has X value and that value is not dependent on how much each bitcoin costs.   This will have ramifications.

In your hideout you can also build a Bitcoin farm which generates 0.2 BTC every (or used to) 10 hours. The cool thing is the price is linked to the current market price of Bitcoin.

The devs keep having to nerf Bitcoin because of the Bitcoin explosion the last couple of months. You used to be able to sell your Bitcoin on the flea market but they disabled that. The rate at which you can farm Bitcoin has been drastically increased. You used to be able to trade a rare barter item for 0,2 BTC but they made the supply really limited. I started noticing this a while ago, since the price is linked to the real market value, and started investing in it myself.

So anywhere, here I am. I am the HODLER now!

 Way back when Bitcoin was $50 = 1 BTC, I bought three. I held and then sold when BTC reached $150. I had tripled my investment, which for almost any other investment, would be incredible. I thought I was pretty smart. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few years later, I noticed BTC was exploding. I bought in, but couldn't help checking the price every five minutes. IIRC, it was bouncing pretty wildly between $5,000 and $10,000 USD. It was pretty nerve-wracking and I spent a Thanksgiving with my family glued to my phone and not being very hungry. I considered it bad for my mental health and exited.

&amp;#x200B;

 Now I'm back in again, and I'm worried that I just bought at the top, but then again, I worried about the same thing at $150 and $10,000, so I guess I'm finally ready to just HODL and believe.

1996," Dear fellow Canadian crypto enthusiasts... I just went through something with [NDAX.io](https://ndax.io/) that I feel like their customers should be aware of. I tried posting this in the main r/CryptoCurrency sub but it got removed cause my account doesn't meet the sexiness requirements of their terms yet, so I'm trying to post this in a few other subs to try and get the word out.

A small background - I am a biased individual with a fundamental mistrust of exchanges. I had a lower 4-figure amount sitting in QuadrigaCX back a couple years when it went tits-up due to its CEO mysteriously dying and disappearing somewhere in India, defaulting the exchange and everyone's money with it. I think the number was something around 150 million? Still getting emails regarding the class-action - very slow moving stuff and I don't really expect much to come out of it realistically, most of that money wasn't retrieved. I consider myself lucky my losses were quite low IN COMPARISON to those who lost some much, much larger bags. The event has never left my mind and will never leave my mind though, y'all need to be aware there are still major risks involved when dealing with exchanges. If you are newer to this (or not), PLEASE follow the general advice you see everywhere of storing your coins in wallets that you have control over as much as it makes sense for you. This shit is not a joke - you are in control of nothing when it comes to exchanges when any amount of shit hits any amount of fans.

Fast forward to 2 evenings ago. I was in the process of moving some assets around and OUT of the exchange. To their credit, I've had mostly a good experience using NDAX for close to a year at this point. I pretty sure they take advantage of price action x the CAD/USD conversions to price sells lower and buys higher by a couple small points to skim off every transaction in addition to fees, but if we're being honest, who isn't pulling that shit at least a little here in Canada? I try to use it mostly for settling back into FIAT when I want to convert back to cash.

I was transferring a small amount of ADA from ndax to my private wallet. It was the last thing I did that night and I didn't wait around for the transaction to go through. It can take a few minutes sometimes, after all. I clicked the button and went to bed. 7 hours later I wake up, and casually check my transaction during my morning to see that it has yet to go through. **This is not the first time I've had a transaction pending for 8+ hours on ndax.**

I ask support about the transaction - they come back pretty quick assuring me that it would be processed right away. Sure enough, within 10-20 minutes I see the transaction complete. Wonderful. (btw, the last time I had a transaction sitting around for a day, prodding support also had that moved within 20 minutes, go figure).

I proceed to check my private wallet and lo behold - I see my transaction of \~200 ADA posted to my wallet, TWICE. Yes, these clowns, in all their technical prowess managed to double my investment by accident. \~400 ADA deposited into my Wallet. Extra wonderful?

Rather than spend more of my precious time going back to support land to let them know they fucked up JUST YET (I'm happy to play fair when it comes to money as long as I'm treated the same way), I just go about my day wondering if their little mistake would go unnoticed or not. 

Sure enough, sometime yesterday evening I receive the following email from NDAX Accounting, Collections, and a representative going by the name of (just see email).

You know, they messed up &amp; they're just following up with me to try and get the situation remedied. That's understandable. It's blockchain after all, that money is my control now. What trips me out is line item number 5 in this linguistic and customer service masterpiece. 

**""""As per our user agreement, you are required to return the funds within the next 24 hour hours to avoid any escalation or enforcement action."""" - Official Representative of** [**NDAX.io**](https://ndax.io/)**.**

Y'all with me up to this point? I, a customer, made a transaction, using the service as intended. Their system fucks up. Suddenly I have 24 hours to comply before their punishers arrive at my house and do, what exactly? How about, """"Hey, our system made an error, would you mind helping us out real quick?"""".

Check my NDAX wallet, they have indeed put a negative/owing amount in my account at the value of the respective ADA. No transactions are working now.

Rather than self-assessing the working status of my own brain, I'll write that in general I know we usually sign our life away with user agreements and never read them. I am guilty of this. You are too, don't lie. My first instinct is actuallyå to believe this fucking guy honestly, cause of course, why wouldn't they have some bullshit written in their agreement with us that if anything goes half sideways they get to put a leather mask on and whip out the tickle trunk, regardless of whose fault it is. We, being a society of smoothbrains without enough wrinkles to go around sign up for this shit like we get off on being fucked without at least getting dinner and a movåie first. 

A company who puts the onus of their mistakes directly on to their customers. Where have we seen this before?

Guys, GENERALLY, I am the type of person not to incur conflict if it's not needed to effectively solve a problem. I would much rather be part of whatever the best solution is and I HATE wasting time on stupid shit. But, given my history with exchanges and the reasonable fact that I really don't like i when people try to bully me for no reason, especially someone i am doing business with, I had to say something AT THE VERY LEAST.

I really don't feel like going to much more trouble over this than spreading the word. I'm moving the remaining assets (not much) i have left in NDAX the fuck out and keeping my distance from them from now on. This guy came back accepting my return minus fees and suggested my assets were not being held in any way. It took me until about 5 minutes ago to have my assets moveable again, whether they were holding them on purpose or not, a """"send transfer"""" action was resulting an in indefinitely spinning icon and no transfer occurring until I pestered support some more. Close to 24 hours of this being the case.

I'd like to note that He DID NOT come back with the specific sections of the user agreement he was referring to to justify his fancy threats. I won't waste any time looking for them because I have better things to do (like write this essay for you kind folks), but i hope this can remain as a precedent on record of their fuckery should anything come up with this team in the future.

To be CLEAR, I am not trying to play any sort victim role here - at the end of this no damage will have been done to anyone other than the reputation of NDAX in my mind. I accept that it's VERY POSSIBLE some of you may think that this is probably the most efficient way for any financial institution to proceed in this situation. Efficient or not, I think this is absolute fuckery and definitely do not trust them with my hard-earned cash anymore. I don't think you should either, but obviously do what you want with your money. 

Does anyone have any GREAT stories about Canadian exchanges worth our time for Fiat IN/OUT? Happy to use DeEXs for token trading, it's that start and end point where we still have to rely on these chumps. Is anyone not a fucking clown in the exchange business? 

I know we Canadians are a relatively small drip in the pond, but this problem will be endemic across all of crypto space until we are able to decentralize fiat exchange somehow. I hope you'll help spread the word.

TLDR - Consider moving your shit out of NDAX, they defaulted to threatening me, a customer, over a mistake made 100% by their system after holding my money for way longer than they should be."
