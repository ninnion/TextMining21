"1001","Came across a great BTC indicator on an old Trace Mayer podcast episode from like 2018 or 2019 called the “Mayer Multiple”. It’s the multiple of the current Bitcoin price over the 200-days moving average. 

Trace Mayer says the best long-term results were achieved by accumulating Bitcoin whenever the Mayer Multiple was below 2.4. 

It’s currently at 1.92 at the time of writing. Been hovering around 1.97-1.98 the last week or so.

"1002","Hi!

Today I published a post where I offered to make public promises. For self-motivation.

And then an idea struck me!

Please read and do not judge strictly.

I'm not a startup. But I came up with a cool startup idea. All the same, I will not be able to bring it to life, but suddenly someone can! There really is something in this)

See:

Today I read the comments on this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mjw7w5/this\_was\_the\_first\_website\_ever\_created\_to\_buy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mjw7w5/this_was_the_first_website_ever_created_to_buy/)

And there are several comments there with something like this that if they had bought bitcoin then, they certainly would not have been able to keep it until today. Do you already understand where I am leading?)

We need a project that certainly must be secure, maybe with the use of blockchain technologies, which would allow you to close your own bitcoins (and not only) from itself for a certain period.

For example, an application is created that is installed along with a wallet. A separate address is created in the wallet, where part of the coins are transferred. We give access to this wallet to our application. And for example, it changes passwords in such a way that the correct password that you know will be installed to the wallet only at a certain point in time.

The main thing is that the coins are not transferred anywhere for storage, namely, they are simply blocked for a certain moment from their spontaneous actions. 

Or you can make a wallet with such a built-in function. Or maybe come up with some kind of time synchronization?

Of course, you can just put a cold wallet in the safe, but this is not so cool, and you can always get it.

The main idea here is to limit yourself.

I even came up with a few names!

Crypto + Blocked = Cryptocked

Or

Crypto + Frozen = Cryptofroz

[cryptocked.com](https://cryptocked.com) and [cryptofroz.com](https://cryptofroz.com) don't work, so there are no such companies? Probably this is not so important, even if there is, you can think of something else)

If someone reads how do you like the idea itself?","3"

"1006","TLDR: I'm a mod and I'm considering leaving with possibly a few other mods (once I decide it is time to chat with them on this) and possibly disbanding the group. The admin, (calls himself Satoshi), has no dev or trading experience and is tricking members for their money. I am a long time member of SD, well before they had this many members. We had a few disagreements but I never thought it was anything major, until all of a sudden a team member was removed from the group without any actual explanation. The reason for me considering to now to leave was because the admin was coming up with ideas on how to get as many new members as possible and basically trick them, through either a paid group, “coaching or fund management”.

These kinds of people are scum in the crypto space, they pray on naive newcomers who don’t really know any better and basically stealing from them by providing a completely useless service. They have no morals and no shame.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------Long version----------------------------------------------------------------

For those of you who have joined or are planning to join Satoshi's Data I suggest you read this whole thing. Please understand that this is not a rant. This is to set the record straight once and for all.

I am doing this due to the fact that a team member just got banned for basically no reason what so ever and because of this, I have decided to tell some truths. For reference, I am currently one of the team members on the Satoshi's Data server and I am fed up with this sh1t that I am seeing. I promised myself to stay away from the drama but now I feel like I cannot be quiet anymore.

So the Satoshi's Data server that we know today is not the Satoshi's Data that once was. The team was at one point very good and got on super well. Due to this, the server grew and the members seemed to become closer and closer. They opened up new roles and allowed more people to help the server out. After a while (post the 3k mark from the top of my head) one of the team (who was admin at the time) then did something completely stupid (though I understood why, I kept my mouth shut) and sided with them even though this event created a rift with the remaining mods and server owner. The server owner (a r3tard who calls themselves Satoshi (also, how f4cking original)) banned them from the server and decided to replace them with someone else.

Some time passed by and Satoshi decides to let them back into the server under the pretense that what happened is never talked about again. Since I saw them back in the server, I can only assume that they only agreed to it and it did not come up. They were to never be given a rank again even though personally I would have.

While they were not in the server, they (banned ex-team member) decided to open up their own server (which in my opinion is fine. Competition is always good) and started from the ground up. I can tell you that it uses a very similar layout because they built the layout (with some input from the team) for Satoshi's Data, so because of that I assume they carried over what they knew into the new one (I think that it was due to this they got banned a second time). During this period, One of the team members told the remaining team that they were wanting to step down from their role but they hadn't made up my mind yet. Guess what, the mods I can assume took it upon themselves and removed them from the role while they were still thinking. Pretty nice huh?

Remember how I said that they sided with the guy who got banned? Guess what, since then, the relationship towards them changed completely. Even I felt no longer welcome nor do I still. Not only that, I found that there was a feeling of if anyone disagreed with Satoshi about anything, they would also be removed from the server without a second thought.

I will say this, during the time the ex-team member was banned, the server was (and still is growing nearing 5k now). The server started releasing new changes. The major one was creating a premium subscription. For the people who paid, I am sorry but you bought a subscription from people who have in reality watched a few how-to trade videos on youtube (for free mind you) and now think they are amazing at trading but you could have done the same and become better than them.

The longer I spend watching the calls being released, the more I am convinced that they aren't actual calls but more like pump and dumps for what the current team is already holding. Though it was funny watching them acting surprised that it managed to hit what they said they thought it would hit. So yeah, your so called premium subscription is pointless completely I believe. Doubt you will ever get your money back. I am positive that someone from the team on the server will come out and deny it though.

For those of you who are wondering how the server has managed to grow so much in such a short period of time, guess what, they did some pretty shady things to spread the invites for the server. [Check the screenshots here for a couple of examples.](https://imgur.com/a/qGHHtBJ) I got some other stuff saved as well. People from there reading this post will recognize those names immediately.

Also, I would like to warn other server owners that members from our team are currently going around into other crypto servers right now (with either their primary or alt accounts) and stealing what other people are doing, coming back to our server and adding it to our server. How do I know this, because I have seen this. I have seen how they even joined the ex-team members server and ousted the team member who just got banned for joining that server as well ([screenshot](https://imgur.com/5YcRZAj)). Some time later, similar things started happening in the Satoshi's Data server. Changes to that reflected the exact same bots that others have, channels implemented in SD that were the same as the other servers etc.

After being with the team for so long, I am pretty pissed that this has happened. This is not right at all.

For those who are boosting the server, there are better servers out there to be boosting. I have already started to slow down in this server and I do plan on leaving it soon. I am sorry Satoshi but this cannot go on any longer.","3"

If you find it difficult to do something, try to promise it to others.

So, briefly and to the point.

We deceive ourselves very often. Although they say that it is impossible to deceive oneself. We make empty promises to ourselves, we don't keep them all the time. Everyone can have their own goals. Let's go without them. Let it be your personal beautiful story. If you want to join, it will be great.

Let's just set ourselves a little bitcoin goal and make it public. And in a year we will return to this post and boast to each other!

My main problem is that I am always afraid to start something. But we must not forget that in small steps you can reach a big goal. This post is my little step. I believe that a beautiful story can be made.

Now I have zero bitcoins.

I make promises to myself and to those who read this post that exactly one year later, on 4/7/2022, there will be 0.05 bitcoin on my wallet (for verification: bc1qa44v8evpjee7san263nvnyqhx4glptpypj6mjn)! And I will not touch the balance of the wallet until there is 0.25 bitcoin on it, regardless of the rate.

For some it may seem ridiculous, but for me it is an important step.

Probably, many regret that they spent their bitcoins ahead of time. Just promise before all of them not to touch them until a certain date!

Just do it!","4"

The good thing about the chargeback is that the customer is generally favored to win the case right from the very start. As a customer issuing a chargeback your card-issuer/bank basically takes your side &amp; then it is up to the merchant (the company that scammed you) to prove that they delivered a quality service to you.
Here are a few quick important points about chargebacks:
You can use a chargeback even if the company has since closed down
Typically you must make a chargeback within 120 days of when you first noticed the problem
Visa has an overall chargeback cut off date of 540 days from the date you initially sent the money
B.) Hire a Funds Recovery Expert to Recover Money Lost to Binary Options Forex: Since I spent a lot of time exposing these scam binary systems &amp; brokers over the past couple of years Ive had a lot of people whove been involved (and burned) by binary options systems reach out to me for help.
To this day I still get emails from people, but what Ive noticed recently is a trend of people asking me about specific binary option recovery companies that claim they are dedicated to helping binary options victims to get their money back.
Now these companies certainly can help you recover your money and help you with the chargeback option,Apart from the initial registration payment which is very cheap, they help you recover your funds or btc before you make full payment of services, that way you don’t have to be scared of being scammed, they are the best recovery sites i know of … you can contact them by visiting their website at  *lacertechprotection,com*","4"

"1068","As a great supporter of blockchain and decentralization, I think we should all do our best to make the cryptocurrency world more accessible if we really want mass adoption.

We probably all agree on the fact that getting started with cryptocurrency has never been so easy as it easy today. However, our ultimate goal must be to show that to people who right now have no idea what crypto is, or to people who are not as """"tech-savvy"""" as some of us might be. That's the only way *everyone* can really gain access to cryptocurrency.

It took a while, but during my spare time I put together a guide on [how to get started with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency](https://towardscryptocurrency.com/get-started-with-cryptocurrency/). I tried to give a little bit of background on blockchain and on the importance of cryptocurrency, before showing how to actually buy and trade cryptocurrency.

Given the target this guide has been written for, I stressed how important it is to familiarize with the technology and terminology before getting started. I emphasized how one should focus on education and avoid following strangers suggestions as much as possible.

Talking about education, I also had a friend of mine help me with this list of [cryptocurrency, blockchain, and trading books](https://towardscryptocurrency.com/resources/best-cryptocurrency-books/) as well. What we did is we basically collected all the books we read about a few trading topics, and picked only the ones we liked the most. Then we put together a few paragraphs per book to share our thoughts and identify what books should be read by whom (mainly depending on their interests and at which point they are along their travel journey).

We plan on expanding the website with more useful guides as time allows, and we would love to get some feedback. Unfortunately, the amount of time it takes to write this sort of things is not negligible, but we would definitely like to get tips on how to improve.

This might not be much when compared to the amount of information available out there, but we did our best to make everything clear. So please, if you have any suggestion for the future let us know.

Thanks!","5"

"1075","Many of you probably had an economics class in highschool or college that said that production was a function of labor and capital, as affected by some amount of knowledge/technology. This view is limited in the 21st century when everything is integrated with everything, technology continues to outperform people in a variety of sectors, and energy is completely missing from the equation. 

Kenneth Boulding, once a polymath, Quaker, and notable (and to an extent, shunned) economist for his futuristic ideas, did away with the classic production function and suggested that: production is a function of energy, materials, and know-how.. in essence, production is governed by how well a society can channel energy into meaningful outcomes, regardless of the number of workers.

I think at some point institutions will give up on teaching solely neoclassical economics and might incorporate different views.. hopefully they will include Boulding's.

"1076","From what I’ve read the easiest way to “hack” Bitcoin is not to hack it all but hack gpu suppliers. Put a dormant virus in the drivers. Since miner have to replace gpu’s when they break or no longer become profitable. Then once you have 95%+ of the gpu’s infected then you change the protocol and it would cause the end of crypto because once the trust is gone and the government doesn’t bail them out then it will no longer exist.

"1078","Unfortunately the total Bitcoin I own is less than 1 coin lol.

However it is enough that I really need to store a portion of it or all of it. I am new to cold wallets and all of my holdings are in Coinbase.

-What are you guys using and how does it work with cold storing? (I don’t plan to use my coins for daily transactions just buy and hold)

-Does what I store NOT make any profit margins since I’m taking it off the block chain or something lol

..Sorry if these are stupid questions. 
I’ve only been in BTC since Dec 2020, so trying to legitimize my holdings by keeping them safe in a cold wallet , but not if the investment doesn’t grow due to transfer of to a cold storage. AGAIN, newb so don’t beat me up too bad lol.

"1080","New to crypto,I need some help or insight please.

I did some research and decided to buy some crypto on local bitcoin. That part went smooth. Then I tried to send the bitcoin to a wallet and here's where all of the confusion starts.

I copied, pasted  my wallet address in the send field and tripple checked. After 4 days I never received the funds. I checked the block and everything was confirmed but the address next to the transaction wasn't the one I pasted in. 
Exodus 
My wallet address: bc1qjl966ul5p5j6zlvh7nsdk7avntaxuft68ezyyq
Transaction id: 2fbc6e56ebb17fc354910ef227a914925253854b2eaac37b732d1b0edc72f575
The address that actually got it: 19vAQ8VnYBauY2cpwuq7PyZqhNK5MgKV8b

So I contacted local bitcoin and they tried to put the blame on the wallet provider then me. Stating that once the crypto is sent it is sent


So I decided to try again with a different wallet.
Same exact result. No crypto received. Funds sent to a different address than what I pasted in and triple checked before I clicked send. 

I'm confused and frustrated. Can anyone explain what might be going on, or how I can resolve it?","4"

I'm really excited that it all started with Bitcoin.  I don't know if it's the idea behind it or just curiosity of where it goes from here, but either way glad to be here for the long hold to see where we are in 5 years.  It is certainly the coin that I can use to buy almost anything else now.

So far in 9 months of buying and scaling out a little bit here and there and buying more I've """"sold"""" 14k worth of fiat into almost 40k (in dollars) worth of digital value.  I've never in my life been able to save that much.

My biggest question from here is what will determine """"value"""" once all the digital assets suck up all the fiat? My guess is Bitcoin will be the store of value for all the other coins to base off of, but maybe it's something else? Time will tell.

"1103","I used to be a daily trader but i lost couple bitcoins and i realised that daily trading could be pretty risky. I guess those of you who tried it are aware of that.

In meantime i noticed an ad here at /r/bitcoin about the [SecureBitcoinWallet](https://securebitcoinwallet.net/) and their investment program, so i decided to try it. It turned out to be a long-term investment (but much safer than my old daily-trading job).

I created a [Secure Bitcoin Wallet](https://securebitcoinwallet.net/) (approximatelly 25 days ago) and i joined their investment program (into level 2). 
So far i got 1.5% interest rate on my initial investment of 40 BTC and i intend to get 10% more in the long-term (within 6 months).

Here is my advice for you: don't be a daily trader and stop trying to make money fast, instead take the longer and the safer path. It takes more time but it brings decent return and it is much safer than daily-trading.


Good luck!","2"

"1113","Yesterday the Estonian Supreme Court ruled in my Bitcoin case.

The state and some media claimed that the court decided to treat Bitcoin like any other economic activity, but this is not true.

The court decided to apply extra regulation to Bitcoin trading that does not apply to other economic activities. Including the requirement to meet customers in person (face to face), as well as the requirement keep IDs of ALL customers and report those who trade more than 1,000 Euros more per month. No other economic activity is subject to such strict requirements, the normal reporting limit is 15,000 Euros not 1,000. Estonia is also the only EU country to apply special strict requirements to Bitcoin, most other EU countries, do treat Bitcoin like other economic activities and do not impose extra strict regulation.

This ruling not only applies to Bitcoin, it applies to all blockchain tokens and assets, the only requirement being that the token or asset can be exchanged for fiat currency somewhere.

I think it's safe to say that Estonia has now confirmed that it is the worst country in the EU to start a Bitcoin or blockchain business.

As a bonus, the court also decided that I do not have the right to silence and that I must provide information that could incriminate myself.

So besides being hostile towards Bitcoin, blockchain tokens and assets, Estonia is also not respectful of fundamental basic human rights.

"1116","Congratulations to you. There is Bitcoin magazine and nothing else. The vast majority of Bitcoin news website that I'm aware of are terrible, really terrible, shameful actually. They make Bitcoin look amateurish. I cringe everytime they appear in my google news feed.

Cointelegraph had nice pictures but poor content. I think it's controller by Dash/Darkcoin ? Many dodgy articles, the rest void of any interest.

Coindesk looks pro but has very poor content. The problem is the people writing there. Except for a few guests doing their promotion maybe..

Most of the others are used for shady opearations, their sole function being advertising the scam the week.

Hopefully now that it has been acquired by Barry, Coindesk will try harder. He needs to fire everyone who has touched this and hire or pay some real freelancer editors/bloggers.

"1117","Okay, here me out. What if ...

We could make a monetary system where each unit has an expiration date. However, that date is variable. The countdown gets reset every time the currency unit changes hands. The goal of this idea is to prevent economic stagnation and the stockpiling of wealth. Basically, it would make trust funds impossible. Obviously there would be lots of loopholes, like trading money between you and your friend every however often to reset it, but ignoring that for now .... This could be practical to implement with a cryptocurrency. Thoughts? What would be other benefits? What would be the downsides? I don't know how long the expiration date should be, or whether it should be constant or variable depending on the amount saved or the state of the economy .... just brainstorming at the moment.

edit: I'm thinking the expiration date would be on the scale of decades.","3"
"1118","I continually see people """"buying"""" &amp; """"selling"""" with exchanges, though they know of others who are as well.

If I could advise people to do one thing that would help them, and Bitcoin, it would be to try to find as many people as you can who will accept Bitcoin from you, either for their goods or services, or in exchange for other currency.  We don't need brick &amp; mortar businesses to accept bitcoin, though that would be nice.  Just find a few people who might be willing to exchange in or out of bitcoin on occasion.  Do this before using some centralized solution.  Tell others to find at least a few, but the more the better, to do the same.  Think about that which you can exchange bitcoins for without converting to another currency, and on the other end, accept bitcoins for your goods/services, and try to find others who will exchange for whatever your local legal tender is in a pinch.

Every time someone asks about using Bitcoin to send funds to X, the first thing we should tell them is to make sure the people receiving funds in X are looking to use them, or exchange them for what they need/want directly *first*, and only exchange into other currency if they must.  Of course it likely won't be easy to find those resources immediately, but if everyone is constantly looking for more people who will accept them, the more efficient this process can be, and the more valuable bitcoin becomes.

I'm so sick of people answering """"but how can I get money with bitcoins?"""" ignoring the fact that they questioner isn't getting that bitcoin is money.  Its usage will grow with our effort to make it grow, or will stay limited to services which keep us dependent &amp; lazy if we refuse to find mutual bitcoin users.

I tell everyone I give bitcoins to that they're welcome to ask me if they want more, or would like to exchange out of them, and that they should find at least 2 others that will accept them as well.  I hope everyone will start advising something like this.","3"

"1120","I was in the San Francisco Bay Area around the time Uber started.

I remember that I immediately became addicted. And I remember that some of my friends wouldn't even give it a shot on the basis that """"cab companies would eventually shut  it down"""". I remember hearing hypotheses like """"The yellow cab mafia will surely stop it"""".

Obviously history shows that didn't happen. I think one of the key reasons is that it was *so obviously superior to everything else* that even if you were a politician trying to block it you would think, on the back of your mind, """"I really need this service"""". No matter how much money was at stake, something so obviously good, so obviously futuristic, can't be stopped.

*""""There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?""""*

Bitcoin Influencers from throughout the Texas Triangle (meetup groups from Austin, Dallas, San Antonio, &amp; Houston) have joined forces with innovative bank-free Bitcoin exchange [Wall Of Coins](http://www.wallofcoins.com) to form **Cyberfunks, the Alliance for the Unbanked.**

We've united to produce our inaugural event, """"Bitcoin Awakens"""" on **Saturday, July 9th**--the weekend of the Block Reward Halving, [""""The Halvening""""](https://www.kaiko.com/bitcoin-clock)

*Suspend Your Disbelief...*

It's Bitcoin literacy couched in fun-filled adventure as teams re-create scenarios from the Star Wars Universe, scouring the city of Austin to solve Amazing Race-style challenges related to Bitcoin/Blockchain technology.

*Decentralized We Stand; Centralized We Fall...*

Successful challenges will receive clues leading to the location of one final ordeal and a victory party in honor of the mysterious creator(s?) of the Bitcoin Protocol. 10% of proceeds go directly to **Capital Area Food Bank of Austin, TX**--the first food bank in the nation to accept cryptocurrency.

So join us for a great time on with an authentic, grass roots, family-friendly, """"Be Your Own Bank"""" experience!

"1138","A few months ago when Craig Wright first leaked documents to news outlets to attempt to out himself as Satoshi, it came to light that his company was the recipient of [$54 Million in R&amp;D subsidies](http://www.grantcentral.com.au/big-numbers-involved-in-rd-tax-incentive/) from the Australian Tax Office, for which he was under investigation (and later had his home raided).  In order to qualify for the subsidies, Wright claimed to have spent millions of dollars on R&amp;D.  However, his company did not spend a cent on R&amp;D.  He claimed that he """"signed over the rights"""" to millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to a third party, and that it was spent on R&amp;D.  This was detailed in a company document.  (The document was taken offline.  If someone happened to save a copy, please post it.  It used to be here:  http://demorgan.com.au/assets/150511_demorgan_54mausindustryrebate.pdf).    

In this document, he allegedly """"signs over the rights"""" to his satoshi coins to a third party, which could (conveniently) only be loaned back to him for R&amp;D purposes. 
Also, like a child, he calls out the person who is investigating him from the ATO in this document.  Paraphrased:  """"See!  I told you I was Satoshi!  Now get off my back"""" https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644014-Tulip-Trust-Redacted.html 

Are you starting to see the motive here?

Long story short, the Australain government wasn't buying the story that he was satoshi nakamoto and that he spent millions of dollars worth of bitcoin on R&amp;D.  His only way out would be to somehow convince the ATO that he is in fact Nakamoto, and does in fact own the bitcoin that he claimed to spend on R&amp;D.

When asked about this in the BBC interview, he made it seem as though the Australian Tax Office was investigating him because they wanted him to pay taxes on his alleged bitcoin holdings.  This is 100% false.  They are coming after him for claiming to own Satoshi's coins and spending them to get a large R&amp;D subsidy. The fact that he misrepresented the situation rather than addressing the actual issue when asked about it in the interview is *very* telling with regard to his likely motive.","3"
"1139","24 hours later when I've seen hundreds of posts explaining why Craig is not SM there's no word from Gavin and he's still being quoted at the """"bitcoin expert"""".  How long before he finally puts and end to this or is he just trying to stir things up like with his other attempts over the last 12 months.","3"
"1140","Gavin Andresen is a small dude who has suddenly found himself thrust into the centre of a big picture, with many players vying for his attention. He is also naive. And bankers, law enforcement types, politicians and lawyers come to him smiling with good manners and sweet words.

He sees himself as some closeted libertarian ninja silently advancing the Bitcoin agenda while working with regulators to better sway their opinion by offering up his assistance, demonstrating good intent. All without realizing he is educating the sharks.

He says that we need to get the masses on board, because then we will be protected, and that it's OK to compromise so that we win these gains. It's a typical herd mentality of frightened sheep flocking together waiting to be slaughtered. What Bitcoin needs are strong individuals willing to stand for their rights and take initiative.

Then there are the """"fringe elements"""" of Bitcoin who call him out, and they are a threat to this strategy, a threat to the united front of the Foundation. And so they make attempts to marginalize, to push-out people who don't dress, think and speak like them.

Bitcoin is bigger than you, me or anyone else here. Bitcoin is not a payments system, it is a transactional network with way more potential for how humans organize, govern and live. We haven't even begun to explore the true possibilities of this new technology of the blockchain.

Bitcoin is a shitty payments system. It is not meant for buying coffee at Starbucks. It is an economical tool to enable new forms of trade to thrive which extends further into the areas of resource management, decentralized law, and digital governance. We can use this to create the next generation of economic activity between humans, and organize on a local level much larger than ever before possible. We can find new ways to disempower banks, politicians, lawyers, police, judges and institutions.

Note the title of the Bitcoin 2013 conference which calls Bitcoin a """"payments innovation"""". This is their way of slanting Bitcoin so it's not a challenging new currency, but a safe addition to help banks streamline. A way to paper over the cracks in our current financial system.

These people are dangerous because of the influence they wield over Bitcoin that can destroy it as a free and open system. Recently Gavin made a post calling to raise the blocksize limit which is connected to this vision of Bitcoin as a system for payments. There is an agenda behind that kind of talk because raising the blocksize limit morphs Bitcoin as a better payment's system but centralizes more power with miners - which is already at dangerous levels in Bitcoin. We can either have a decentralized, free and uncensored Bitcoin, or a centralized Bitcoin good for payments (same as the banks).

I think it's important to crate an iconography around bitcoin, because for everyday people (and not tech/geeks/nerds/hackers) it's much easier to get infos about the bitcoin world through images. We have to spark people's curiosity towards bitcoin in the easiest way possible.
Bitcoin is step by step getting deeper in our culture, and a culture needs art.

Design create culture.
Culture shapes values.
Values determine the future.

"1145","Quoting from the BBC article, just incase people didn't read the whole thing

&gt; Here's what happened.
&gt; 
&gt; On Monday evening, I suggested to Wright's PR firm that if he could send me a fraction of a coin from an early Bitcoin block - which of course I would return - that might show he had Satoshi's keys. But Wright's team came up with a different plan on Wednesday afternoon.
&gt; 
&gt; They sent me a draft blog in which he outlined a scheme that would see Matonis, Andresen and the BBC all send small amounts of Bitcoin to the address used in the first ever transaction. Then he would send it back, in what would be the first outgoing transactions from the block since January 2009.
&gt; 
&gt; We went ahead with our payments - I sent 0.017BTC (about £5), which you can still see in the online records. Matonis and Andresen sent similar amounts.
&gt; 
&gt; Then we waited. And waited. Then my phone rang - with the news that the whole operation was """"on hold"""", with no reason given.
&gt; 
&gt; Eighteen hours later we are still waiting for the payments to be made - and now Wright's new blog says that is not going to happen.

Literally everyone that isn't somewhat of an insider in the community (by insider I mean just simply following the news beyond the mainstream) thinks he is Satoshi.

"1149","A fee dependent block size limit to prevent spam and ensure that security is paid for:
 
What would you think about a new consensus rule that allowed miners to mine valid bigger blocks only if the total amount of fees collected in the blocks are greater than a certain threshold?

If a miner manages to construct a 1MB block where the total amount of fees collected is greater than X, then the new consensus rule would allow that miner to extend the size of this block up to 2MB.
If the total amount of fees in the 2MB block is greater than Y, then the miner is allowed to further extend the size of this block to 3MB, and so on...

The threshold defining X and Y can be made static for simplicity, or it could be made flexible according to some relevant parameters.

This new fork can be found here: https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory

So far, """"goatpig"""" appears to have made some notable positive changes, and I'm excited to see some renewed effort with this wallet:

1. Removed """"phone home code"""".
2. Added changelogs to the git repository.

however it was created recently (2015.11.22), and has no signatures from others vouching for its authenticity. I have not seen any public, cryptographically signed indicators of """"etotheipi"""" giving any endorsement of """"goatpig"""" either. Can anyone vouch for the authenticity of this PGP public key?


There are releases published using github's release file storage feature: https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases

There is a sha256sums file included which does have a valid signature and the hash that is signed does match up with the .deb file that is included in that release. I'm not sure why the release package is signed but not the git repository's release tag.



If anyone has any knowledge on why git tags are not signed or what I may be doing wrong when trying to verify a signed git tag, that would be appreciated. Also, if anyone has any comments or experience with this new fork of Armory, I would appreciate to know what you have to say. As with any bitcoin software, public scrutiny is critical, regardless of how well intended the author, because everyone is human and can make mistakes. I don't think Armory has nearly the eyes or users that larger projects like """"Bitcoin Core"""" have. At the same time, """"Bitcoin Core"""" is lacking a lot of features that Armory does have, so there is definitely a reason to use another piece of software that extends the functionality of """"Bitcoin Core"""". Armory is potentially a great piece of software and now that the database size and initial start up have become much more efficient, it's possible it could be the wallet of choice again. However, more public review could really help to strengthen Armory's reputation and bring it more mainstream.

Although I am calling for more review and criticism of Armory, at the same time, I'd like to acknowledge and thank the key contributors to that piece of software """"etotheipi"""" and """"goatpig"""" for their hard work that they have donated to the world over many years.","3"

"1157","**Tldr : If miners collectively commit to a transactional fee range that covers periods of network congestion and spare capacity, we may have a much more healthy network.  End users and companies providing Bitcoin services would have much better predictability about network behaviour.**

Advocates of big blocks and small blocks both have very good reasoning on their side.

Pieter Wuille (a clearly very clever guy that we have much to be thankful for) has I believe stated in the past that blocks should be full.  While this may be an anathema to those that believe the network should always have spare capacity, he has a very good point.  If transactions were free, or even very very cheap, why should a ledger that aims to persist for **EVER** have to hold these records, and why should miners have to validate and relay them.  We know that with the recent approaches to the capacity limits, the network has autonomously cleared up many of the issues around spam and non-commercial type transactions.

Conversely a network a that cannot scale, or even one that does not have a clear path to scalability, is not something that many companies and potential start-ups feel that can commit planning and resources to.  The fee market is a good thing but a fee market without any predictability becomes impractical.  Erik Voorhees pointed out that during one of the flood events the fee calculation that his wallet gave him was over $3!  This is before we get to any type of network overload associated with a price spike or a crash. 

Those that say larger blocks will risk centralisation, have to be realistic about the commercial imperatives for miners that have to keep an eye on the bottom line.   Segwit in combination with a 2mb hard fork get us to a capacity of approximately 1 million transactions per day.  If the average cost of a transaction was to rise to 20 cents due to capacity limits this gives miners $200,000 a day in fees, representing over 20% of their revenue after the halving, based on a $500 bitcoin price. 

In that event there would be great commercial pressure for them to increase their capacity, when so much of their profit margin rested on increased throughput.  They could risk 50 cent or even 1$ fees but at what point do users simply move to another chain?

If Lightning does come to pass sooner rather than later and it works as well as it might, we have a solution for our congestion problems.  However even in that eventuality, some users still need to know what on chain transactions are going to cost, be it $0.1 or $10.

Setting aside how the network might adapt for a moment, whether through an adaptive block size limit or softcoded block sizes.  Imagine if miners said they would endeavour to always keep fees below 20 cents at periods of high demand but also did not feel obliged to process transaction paying a fee less than 5 cents as a general rule.  This range could obviously be priced in any currency or sats/per byte if more appropriate.

Users, wallet providers, and companies would have predictability over what they should always include as a minimum fee.  Miners would have revenue projections based on anticipated demands and investors could make judgments about the viability of the network and its ability to scale. 

Miners are services providers just like ISP’s or municipal utilities.  They have capital and operational costs and risks that need to be accounted for.  But a network that is characteristically unpredictable, doesn’t work well for users or companies building tier 2 applications, and hurts everyone.","3"

"1168","I have some concerns about the Blockchain born of ignorance; an issue which I seek to rectify here.

Based on my inadequate understanding of Bitcoin's blockchain, to control processing power is to control decision making. (Let's say I control 1% of the processing power). When my nodes solve a hash function, they get to verify transactions and earn bitcoins. Since hashes are solved by randomly guessing Public Keys and putting them in the hash function, I should solve 1% of all hashes (proportional to the % of the processing power I control.)
I can also use processing power to change the blockchain (public ledger). Since I only control 1% of the processing power, however, the rest of the network will always produce a longer blockchain and ignore my edited chain. I can't beat them because my processing power is too small.

However, what if I wanted to change a transaction before it was posted to the blockchain? Say, for instance, that I solved a hash, and then altered the transaction before placing it on the blockchain. I will be the first one to solve the hash 1% of the time, and will thus be the first one to add a new (edited) transaction to the blockchain 1% of the time. Thus, 1% of the time I will be providing the longest chain to the network, which will be accepted. I am successfully committing fraud 1% of the time.

The above paragraph is false. However, I don't understand how it is false. Could some helpful soul please enlighten me?","2"
"1169","(Well, I'm """"6 weeks behind,"""" but close enough; bare with me, please. I've always wanted to get into Bitcoin, but otherwise am *brand* new. I've read the material on the sidebar.) 

Now what? I plan to use *Armory* as my wallet manager, which I already have installed and configured—then I'll buy a Bitcoin or two off of a Bitcoin exchange (and probably tumble them). Then I should be good to go?

- Since I've downloaded the whole ledger, does this mean that bitcoin-qt will *always* be running in the background (validating transactions and so on) whenever I turn on my computer and log into this OS? 
- Does that take up a lot of RAM/CPU? 
- In fact, how exactly is my computer utilized?
- The blockchain seems to grow at about 4GB per month. That's pretty substantial (my Ubuntu partition's only about 400GB). If I run out of HDD space, do I then just become unable to, say, use Armory?
- Does anyone have a setup wherein the bitcoin database is stored on an external HDD? (I have a few extra laptop HDDs that I've collected over the years, and can easily spare a 300GB one to use specifically for bitcoin).

I really like the idea of Bitcoin, which is a large part of why I'm buying into it and trying to support the network. On the other hand, the more I read about it, the less certain I become of its long-term viability (especially in regards to the limited number of coins, thus each coin's subsequently increasing value, and an increasing concern of mining being centralized.) 

**Edit:** I'm downloading the entire blockchain because I'm under the impression that doing so assists the Bitcoin network as a whole (... somehow? I think my computer can now be used to validate transactions.) Am I incorrect?

**Edit 2:** ~~I've read a lot over the past few months and still don't really know what the blockchain is. I know that it's a ledger downloaded by every node, and these nodes use said ledger to verify transactions... but what does that mean? Say items on the ledger take the form of """"Payer X gives Y bitcoins to buyer Z,"""" great—but why does this situation translate to Bitcoin being secure, anonymous, or not-easily-toyed with?~~

~~So, my attempt at understanding this is as follows:~~

~~Every transaction on the ledger has a public key, and every wallet has an associated private key (X gives Y bitcoins to Z). Wallets have access to these keys (thus, they """"hold"""" bitcoins—or more accurately, hold transactions of bitcoins being given to them). When someone wants to spend bitcoins [from wallet **X**] by adding a transaction to the ledger, they first have to present their private key/s (indicating they have the appropriate transactions to spend), and then this new transaction is added to the ledger—and wallet **Z** gets its new private key that is associated w/ this transaction. Now, the key associated with the transactions that wallet **X** just used... become invalid, I guess?~~

~~Am I even on the right track? :l Why can't someone just artificially put a transaction on the ledger? I imagine it has something to do w/ mining—where each bitcoin is a solution to a particular mathematical problem? So if someone *can* figure out a solution to this problem, they would theoretically be able to put a transaction on the ledger, but such a thing just isn't viable, which is why we need huge computer processing power to come up w/ solutions?~~

"1180","I reviewed the [different proposals to solve the block size vs decentralization problem](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy) and I did not see mention of a time-and-amount-based trimming of the blockchain. **I humbly submit my proposal for prioritizing low-bitcoin-address removal at regular blockchain-trimming events.**

1. **Set a lifetime for bitcoin addresses** that is proportional to the *percentile* of addresses containing fewer bitcoin. For example, addresses with 99.9th percentile bitcoin amounts have a lifespan of 100 years. Addresses with 50th percentile bitcoin amounts have a lifespan of 10 years. Address with lowest percentile bitcoin amount would have a lifetime of 1 year. Lifetimes are assigned during a transaction or Collation event (see #2). If addresses with bitcoin still exist past their lifetimes, then all nodes automatically should make the bitcoin permanently inaccessible at the next Collation event (see #2).

2. **Collate all bitcoin transactions every 1 year**. This means nodes collectively create a single massive block that must contain all valid addresses and bitcoin amounts and may delete all addresses with expired lifetimes. Lifetimes are updated. All previous blocks may then be deleted from all nodes should the node owner choose to. Bitcoin in addresses not contained in this single massive block may not be spent ever again.

**These two rules will act together as an indirect block size limiter.** Unless people actively move expired bitcoin prior to a Collation event, the bitcoin is lost. This creates a minimum cost of preserving ownership of bitcoin. Not recycling bitcoin from deleted addresses is important in order to disincentivise militant actions against miners during the Collation block creation window. 

The main idea I want to communicate to you all is **pruning the blockchain to reduce the required data storage duty of nodes will help nodes remain active**. The timespans I stated don't matter as much as this idea. The rules I present are prioritization methods for determining what data in the blockchain may be safely preserved and what may be discarded. Following these rules should make larger block sizes more agreeable to those promoting a decentralized bitcoin.

Please correct me if I have made any statements that contradict how you understand Bitcoin works. Also, point me to any similar proposal.

Thank you for your time.

Note: I realize the 1000-year and 100-year lifespans are a problem since Bitcoin has a [2106 problem](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_timestamp), but I wanted to show you some round numbers.

**tl;dr Prune the blockchain every year. Prune smallest transactions first.**","3"

"1201","Hi,

I apologize for yet another post on the fork but I've been doing research on how to prepare myself and my bitcoin for the upcoming fork and while I understand most of it, I have a few lingering questions.

First, let me summarize what I learned. Please correct me if I am wrong. This fork, unlike the BCH fork, has no built-in replay protection. This means that any transaction I make on the BTC blockchain is also valid on the B2X blockchain and vice versa. So while I meant to send someone 0.1BTC, if someone chooses to replay that transaction on the B2X chain, I could end up sending 0.1BTC + 0.1B2X. However, there is opt-in protection, where on every transaction, you send a small amount of bitcoin to a special address that is not valid on the other chain. This will make sure your transaction is rejected on the other chain.

Now, for my questions:

1. This fork should not affect me receiving bitcoin correct? I should be able to continue buying safely on an exchange like Coinbase and send it to my Ledger Nano (discounting human / programming error by the exchange itself) as if bitcoin did not fork correct?

2. How am I supposed to send a small amount of bitcoin to these special addresses along with a transaction? To me, a transaction has always been 1 address to 1 address with amount X. Certainly it can't be two separate transactions as that doesn't make sense either.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. :)","3"

"1203","I am taken quite by surprise by the latest growth of Bitcoin and not only because of the actual price increase but because of how close the B2X fork is. I assumed that right before and after the fork people would be reluctant to trade as they would wait for things to settle and see what the actual outcome will be. Yet, the complete opposite is happenning. Bitcoin is being bought massively. 


Several articles have popped up about Wall St. investing massive amounts in Bitcoin and it made me think why wouldn't the big ""pro-B2X"" players do the same? That is, buy an enormous amount of BTC before the fork to then proceed in millions of micro-transactions on B2X in order to lure the miners away from BTC.


I am new to all of this so my reasoning might be flawed. If this is the case please enlighten me as to why this is an improbable scenario.","3"

"1205","Hi,

I had a couple of questions about the upcoming fork. My goal is to basically get the new forked coin ASAP and then sell them off in favor of the original BTC. 

Right now I only own a fraction of BTC and it is stored in a wallet on my exchange (I know bad idea). I think they will take some time before the implement the functionality to allow me to access my forked coin, so there will be a delay in accessing it.

How does the fork work if I have software wallet ? Would I have access to it right away ?","3"
"1206","There should really be a sticky or some mega-thread discussing this. We are currently moving closer to the hardfork and it might come quicker than expected. Also, it would be good to know when the snapshot of the chain is taken in order to be ready for market fluctations i.e. moving things around to manage risk prior to the fork (if possible).

Personally, I have no clue where I should store my BTCs prior to the hardfork. Coinbase came out today stating that they will credit B2X coins based on your BTC holdings prior to the fork. And they will pause any transactions for 24h following the fork. How does this compare to my Ledger Nano S? And how do I move ahead if I wish to trade my BTC or the mirrored B2X without losing any of them unintentionally due to no replay protection? 

I would love to get a discussion going based on the different scenarios that may take place, and how we can plan/prepare for each. If you believe I am grossly uneducated by asking these questions, please provide resources that may help me and others wondering.","2"

That's an insane jump in price, I can afford the loan as I work a steady job and get paid to go to college so it's not something I wouldn't be able to pay off. Would 1000 turn over some profit or would I have to invest in a whole coin? I'm newish to stocks and currencies but have an idea on how they actually work, any advice would be great! Thanks ✌","4"

"1212","Been buying bitcoin for over a year now (so it’s not a new phenomenon for me) however have never hodled. I’ve seen the light now though, and been looking  to seriously invest for around 6-8 weeks now. 

At first though, I wanted to wait till after the Gold fork as I was watching the price rise and rise, but I just figured this was due to people wanting free coins and was SURE the price would drop straight after. It never did. 

So the last week I’ve been wanting to buy, but just been waiting for even the slightest of dip before firing. It’s still not here. Now that we’ve passed the $7000 point, I genuinely don’t know what to do. The FOMO is hurting big time. 

I even slightly feel now that the price is over exaggerated and after the next fork, the price will bomb. Is it too late to buy? Should I wait till after the next fork?

____________

pardon the wall of text but this is super important to me.



i am a hardcore bitcoin evangelist and my entire facebook friend list probabaly associates me with bitcoin because i spend a great deal of time educating people and discussing it on social media. my background is computer network engineering and web developing; i've studied bitcoin for a few years now.

**first** i wanna talk about USI Tech.

not long ago i was asked to invest some bitcoin via a company called USI Tech. at the time, USI Tech's only relation to bitcoin was that they sold cryptic ""bitcoin packages"" that would return 140% over 140 days. that means if i gave them 1 BTC today, they would give me 1% of a bitcoin for 140 days, meaning that after 100 days, my initial investment would be recovered, and then all i get to do is wait for those 40 days to see my profit.

when i was first recruited, it was before they rebranded themselves. this was just a few weeks ago. prior to this rebranding, there was no indication from the company regarding exactly how they were able to provide that kind of return on investment. at the time their only product other than these ""bitcoin packages"" was a license that provided access to a very special very secretive robot that harnessed artificial intelligence to yield apparently handsome returns via speculative arbitrage in the foreign exchange market. there are zero trades attributed to this ""robot"" and in fact there is zero evidence of a robot at all. they do have software for their customers that apparently track gains however there is zero correlation between these numbers and their apparent source.


since their rebranding, they are now marketing these ""bitcoin packages"" as having generated income via *cloud mining*. keep in mind that USI Tech does not sell hashrate, nor even techinically access to remote hardware; USI Tech sells ""bitcoin packages"" however how these packages specifically relate to hashrates accessed on remote hardware, or *cloud mining*, is not at all explained. [in fact, here on their website they say that details will be released and then reference a date that has already passed.](http://www.usitech.io/usi-tech-info/usi-tech-mining-news/).

to be blunt, cloud mining is a meme. mining cryptocurrency for a profit is generally difficult even for the big boys in China. that bitcoin could be worth more in the future than it is now is the reason why miners mine; the energy spent mining bitcoin costs more than the value of those mined bitcoins. 

how does USI Tech not only mine so successfully that they themselves can be profitable, but so that customers who purchase this mining remotely can be successful **to the tune of 140% over 140 days?**


also they are in pre-sale for their own ICO, 

also they have zero registration documents filed with the SEC, 

also the names that *used* to be on their masthead, Ralf Gold and Joao Severino, were involved in past scams,

also their business is registered in Dubai, just like almost every single forex ponzi,

also like i said there is zero proof that they trade anything at all, anywhere.


**i really thought i knew my shit. is there a more experienced bitcoin user that can point to any situation where that sort of profitibility can be achieved by cloud mining?**

if the question seems rhetorical for the high bitcoin minds on this sub, then maybe i've done my duty by exposing USI Tech's dubious claims and raising suspicion which brings me to my next point:

**secondly** i wanna talk about the tactics used by this company to fool people.

primarily i should say that USI Tech operates a multilevel marketing structure that rewards recruitment through commission. it is not a coincidense that ponzi schemes use MLM structures to grow; ponzis require a continuous flow of new investment in order to work. to be blunt, MLM is a predatory business approach that exploits people's hope and greed. all MLM use the same tactic of targeting people's desperation to earn passive income.

*USI Tech takes advantage of a population of people who are desperate to invest in a technology they do not comprehend.* this is how they can get away with selling something that there is no evidence of. people now have a very dire desire to be involved in bitcoin because they have seen the news. people that do not know enough about investments, let alone cryptography, are aching to enter the space before all the potential is claimed.

there is much fertile potential to scam people who don't know that hyperbole like *""smart contracts made off-chain that return high yield arbitration via intelligent algorithms backed by authenticated crypto-asset bonds..""* is all bullshit. in most cases, even if they could, there is no code to review, no whitepaper to digest, and in the case of USI Tech, not even satisfacory rhetoric to substantiate anything being sold by these scammers.

earlier today, i went into a facebook group called USI TECH BITCOIN TEAM SUCCESS, and i asked a question. i said ""i'm interested in joining USI Tech, and as a programmer and bitcoin nerd, i want to know the details of their mining operation.""
immediately the reaction was two-fold. promptly some were chiming in with agreeable sentiments like 'i've also wondered' and 'yes there is a lack of transparency', and others were already indignant with stuff like 'they said they are working on transparency give them a break' and 'troll detected, usi tech is not a scam because look i made money'.

okay fair enough the conversation was started and i was pretty quickly banned from the group. i had a dozen or so people in my ear at this point asking me what happened, people that have invested real money in this company. i spent hours discussing this with some of them. i had a conversation with the group's admin, [here it is](https://imgur.com/a/YyljQ). he basically says that he doesn't want to upset people that have found a way to make money, and that my questions should be directed somewhere else.

i've sent exhaustive emails pondering specifics to USI Tech to no avail.

**in conclusion, bitcoin has provided rich new opportunities for scamming people.**

let me be clear: yes money can be made in a ponzi scheme. *the operative to earning money in a ponzi is to know when to discontinue reinvestment.* by all means, partake in the ponzi even, so long as you know what you are contribtuing to. the number one argument that people will make in favor of the ponzi they're in is 

""but i made money"".

it is our duty as crypto-enthusiasts to spread responsible education regarding bitcoin. i say to people ""if you are interested in bitcoin, invest in bitcoin, because that is where the actual innovation is"".

**TL;DR:** fuck bitcoins ponzis like USI Tech, stay alert, stay safe.","3"
"1224","C'mon and join the effort to keep bitcoin decentralized!  (And to fight this S2X nonsense)

I have an Intel-based DS916+ so YMMV of course depending on your model! (I heard that non-intel models do not support docker)

1. Go to Package Center, search for ""docker"" and install it.  Open the Docker app.
2. Go to the Docker app and click on the Registry section.  Search for ""bitcoin""
3. Select ""ruimarinho/bitcoin-core"".  This one is appears to be the most up to date and has 0.15.0.1.  Click Download, and select the ""latest"" tag.
4. In the Image section, click Launch with ruimarinho/bitcoin-core selected.
5. Go to the ""advanced settings"", then ""port settings"".
6. Change all of the ""auto"" to the actual port number.  (IE, bind the external 8333 to the internal 8333)
7. Click OK to dismiss the dialog, then Next, then Apply.  Your node is now running!
8. Setup your home internet router to forward ports 8333 and 18333 to your Synology.  You should also have assigned a static IP to your Synology.  For additional help about all the firewall and NAT forwarding stuff, check out https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#enabling-connections

You can verify if your node is fully reachable by the outside world by going to https://bitnodes.earn.com/#join-the-network

*Side Note*: I'm not sure, but maybe you can skip all the port forwarding stuff if in the advanced settings, under network, you select ""use same network as docker host"", and maybe it will be able to work automatically like described in https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#network-configuration, but I didn't test that. 

Questions:

1. I don't need to open 18333 on the router for testnet, right?  The bitcoind appears to be running on the normal blockchain and I don't plan on running the testing blockchain.
2. Why was the docker image setup for port forwards on 18332, 18444, and 8332?  Is that for the RPC client to interact with the bitcoin daemon?  Or did the docker image maintainer just set those there as the are common alternate configurations?","3"

There are so many different wallets and exchanges, I wanna make sure this would be a fairly safe/reliable method for buying and storing bitcoins.

"1243","Recently I've been thinking about what it would be like if Bitcoin became mainstream, and I really like the idea however I think that there's one huge flaw in Bitcoin.


It's a known issue that's been brought up several times, but from what I've seen it's been mostly ignored for some reason and not treated like a serious issue.


The problem is that there are definitely not enough Bitcoins to run the global economy. I think that the reason why people completely ignore this problem is because they don't realize how fragile cryptocurrencies are.


If we assume 21 million bitcoins, which is 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis then it's just enough to run the global economy. The value of current 1 cent would be about 21 satoshis. However people don't even realize how extreme the rate at which cryptocurrencies can be lost forever is. There are so many reasons this can happen, e.g. someone forgets his key or simply dies.


It's safe to assume that within 10 years we can end up with only 0.5 million Bitcoins in circulation. If it had to replace the current dollar, then it would mean that 1 satoshi would already be 2 cents.


0.5 million Bitcoins is still a very optimistic scenario, an order of magnitude too optimistic.


This is in my opinion the biggest flaw currently. There's no chance Bitcoin will ever run global economy with its current supply.


The only solution I can think of is to hard-fork bitcoin and somehow add ~16 more decimal places, though I'm not sure if it's possible.


Any thoughts? What are the proposed solutions to this problem? Why do people completely ignore this?","2"

"1245","It's absolutely ridiculous how many threads and conversations revolve around the same old argument. Bitcoin was a currency for small day to day purchases, but it's not anymore. However that is not Bitcoins fault. It comes down to economic fundamentals, it comes down to us and way we spend. 

Image you had a wallet with $1000 worth of litecoin and in the other wallet is $1000 worth of Bitcoin. Now fast forward to July 2018 and your Bitcoin is now worth $2000 and your litecoin is $1100. Zip back to Nov 2017 and ask yourself which crypto will you spend to buy that new iPad? The point is why would we spend from an asset (Bitcoin) that is appreciating in value over one that is relatively price stable (litecoin) we wouldn't, it just wouldn't make good economic sense.

Bitcoin is fine as is, it doesn't need to change so its better for day to day purchases, as I said its about how we spend not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently heading in the right direction and if innovative upgrades like Segwit keep on coming I'm sure it will. Lets face it, Bitcoin has become something more important, more useful than just a P2P digital currency. It is now central to the growth and strength of the entire cryptocurrency sector.  Bitcoin has become an investment tool for the masses, a settlement layer, a currency for larger purchases and its become a store of value and that store of value relies on the 8 years of confidence that it currently has, and that confidence needs to be maintained so we can continue seeing growth and draw in new crypto-enthusiasts. 

Aggressive moves from the B2X and BCH camps if unsuccessful will only help to strengthen Bitcoin and improve user confidence, but the danger is 'what if' one of them was successful and managed to weaken or even replace Bitcoin, the instability that would create could be extremely damaging.

B2X corporate-coin and BCH Wu-coin put up the argument that Bitcoin has deviated from Satoshi's vision, its no longer a P2P for day to day purchases and so now their coins should replace it. Thats a smoke-screen, the only reason why these aggressors want to replace Bitcoin is so they can steal Bitcoins brand and the value/confidence thats stored within the brand. Put simply they want to profit and they want power at the expense of Bitcoins value to the entire crypto-community.

We have some very good alternatives for day to day purchases, ones that are relatively price stable, Litecoin for one, it was designed especially to be the silver to Bitcoins gold, to be the currency for day to day purchases. We can use that, or Dash even Monero all are reasonably price stable, but to my mind Litecoin is the standout. We can use them and not mess with Bitcoin, just allow Bitcoin to carry on the way it's going.","2"

**What is Paradise Papers?**

The Paradise Papers is a database comprising around 13.4 million documents, which reveals over 25,000 companies owned by the world's rich and influential individuals.

The documents were obtained from two companies in Singapore and Bermuda by a German newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). A major part of the Paradise Papers comprises leaked files from company 'Appleby'.

The files reveal data of over 25,000 companies owned by individuals from 180 countries, from 1950 to 2016.

Below is a comparison of Paradise Papers with Panama Papers:

----

**Number of politicians and public officials**

* Paradise Papers: 127 politicians and public officials (14 current or former country leaders included) from more than 47 countries

* Panama Papers: 140 politicians and public officials from more than 50 countries

----

**Which leak is the bigger than other?**

Paradise Papers is bigger in number of records (13.5 million in Paradise Papers vs. 11.5 million in Panama Papers) and Panama Papers is bigger in terms of size of the leak (1.4 Tb in Paradise Papers vs. 2.6 Tb in Panama Papers).

Due to that, I would recommend to say ""one of the biggest leaks in the history of journalism"" instead of the biggest and then you could compare some of the different figures related to the data size between Paradise Papers and previous leaks.

----

**Journalists in Paradise Papers project**

Media partners, countries, journalists

* Number of journalists 381

* Number of media partners 96

* Number of countries 67

If you just consider the number of journalists, yes. There are more journalists working on the Paradise Papers than the Panama Papers at the time of the project release (381 Paradise Papers - 376 Panama Papers).

As for the number of media partners and number of countries, there are a few less. Panama Papers had 100+ media partners and 76 countries. The ICIJ currently has for Paradise Papers 96 media partners and 67 countries.

&gt; [The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists](https://projects.icij.org/paradise-papers/the-influencers/#/) have a nice website where you can explore the offshore ties of over a dozen Trump advisers, Cabinet members, and major donors.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary in the Trump administration, **shares business interests with Vladimir Putin’s immediate family,** and he failed to clearly disclose those interests when he was being confirmed for his cabinet position.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; **One of Navigator’s most important business relationships is with a Russian energy firm controlled, in turn, by Putin’s son-in-law and other members of the Russian president’s inner circle.**
&gt; 
&gt; Who would have thought that the former vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus would have connections to Russian oligarchs. Totally unexpected.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if Manafort and Gates used the [Bank of Cyprus](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/manafort-linked-accounts-cyprus-raised-red-flag-n739156) to launder the money...

&gt; * [Russia funded Facebook and Twitter investments through Kushner associate](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/russia-funded-facebook-twitter-investments-kushner-associate)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; VTB funded a $191m investment in Twitter. About the same time, Gazprom Investholding financed an opaque offshore company, which in turn funded a vehicle that held $1bn-worth of Facebook shares.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The money flowed through investment vehicles controlled by Milner, who also invested in a startup in New York that Kushner co-owns with his brother. **Kushner initially failed to disclose his own holding in the startup, Cadre, when he joined Trump’s White House.**
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Moscow frequently used intermediaries to ensure “plausible deniability” for the actions of senior officials.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; “Russia’s influence over operations – whether that be allocating funds for disinformation campaigns or providing financing to extremist movements, or others – are intentionally opaque,” said Polyakova. **“They operate in the shadows.”**

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Trump administration’s **most senior banking watchdog** appears in the Paradise Papers in connection with an offshore bank that **is under investigation by US authorities for possible tax evasion.**
&gt; 
&gt; Republicans plan on raising taxes on the middle class so that tax evaders like Gary Cohn, Steve Mnuchin, Rex Tillerson, Ben Carson, Wilbur Ross, Carl Ichan, Tom Barrack can continue evading taxes.

Now that I am trying to get accounts to buy bitcoin on I am noticing most places require me to be 18. I have been trading forex for about a year, but I can do this on my dad’s account and it is much easier. 

I am wondering which sites I could use to trade bitcoin and other currencies under the age of 18. 

Also, could I just have Mom or Dad setup an account for me to trade? Could my account potentially be shut down? I would h using my own bank account and credit card so I don’t know if I would even pass the identification part of the signup.

"1254","I think bitcoin currently is just a tool to get more wealth. It's a bit in the ""Unknown"" category. In other words, not many people know about it; but those who are savvy at this moment can get some substantial wealth if they invest.

The way I see it, the dollar is failing and our current economy isn't able to keep up. The average median income in America is $50,000 - Which is laughable. There is no way, that the average annual income of 50k a year is going to sustain the oncoming generations, hence the need for Bitcoin. 

As Bitcoin continue to evolves, I think it will be just as common. In my opinion, it is simply a tool to level the playing field of those who are in positions of power. For instance, some of these ""APP"" jobs have given more power to the people rather than to corporations. 

Side jobs like Amazon flex, Postmasters, Lyft etc; which pay roughly $15-25 an hour are basically starting people with a leg up, over the laughable minimum wage. To this day, I still think people are still being duped into doing the College degree route, because, that's just ""What they are being told to do.""

10 years ago, College didn't make sense to me. It still doesn't. I see people with college degrees struggling to get by. Today, I read articles on millenials with full 4 year degrees unemployed, looking for work, and taking jobs. The other day, I met a kid who graduated with a Neuroscience degree @ age 23 with $70,000 in debt. 

What a very stupid ""Educated"" individual.

I don't think Bitcoin is going to be the End all and Be all in our society. I think in 50 years, bitcoin will be an average currency. In other words, I believe It's sort like bringing the american Dollar back to 1901 - In that is is ""resetting"" the economy in a sense. Those of us who are ""In the know"" now, and play our cards right can be well off for the next 20-40 years.

However, I don't think it will last forever, just like everything else. Life evolves and as we progress, we need to keep our eye on the ball on our own personal goals and be open to whatever comes upon the horizon of humanity. We all know the dollar is shit at the moment. It will continue to become shit, and thus this is simply of humanities way of adjusting. 

In the future, hell, who knows what will arise. Bitcoin might be the dominating currency and the dollar won't even exist anymore. If that's the case, then eventually bitcoin will follow the same route the dollar went, and then what will happen? only time will tell I guess.","4"
"1255","Starting to dive in to the technical details behind Bitcoin and had a basic question. When your wallet creates a new address, how does it know that someone else isn’t already using that private key? Is it just relying on a true random number in the 2^256 possible addresses being unique each time or are there other safeguards? What if a malicious/non-savvy wallet creator didn’t truly use a random number but something that actually is an existing private key?

"1258","Let's say you have made a 100€ deposit on Kraken. The balance is in EUR. You want to buy bitcoin.

Is it:

1. You buy 0.01 XBT. The balance of the account is now: 

        XBT 0.01
        EUR 38.54

    The trade is closed. No further action is required. These balances will stay unchanged until a new trade is done.

2. You buy 0.01 XBT. You have an ""open position"" (long in XBT) of 0.01 XBT. It is waiting to be closed one day, and then the P&amp;L (profit &amp; loss) is calculated. Similar to this [screenshot](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201424378/Illustration.png). At the end of the open/close position (let's say the XBT has increased a little between the open and the close), the new balance is calculated with the P&amp;L:

        EUR 103.13

**Is Kraken doing 1. or 2.?**

___

As far as I know Forex (non-crypto) trading platforms use the system 2. For example if you have an EUR deposit / balance and you're trading EUR/USD, you can never withdraw in USD. You just open/close positions, and then the P&amp;L is applied on the EUR balance.

It's not clear for me if Kraken offers 1. or 2.","3"

But:

If they guarantee that the payouts will be with ""dust"" from newly minted coins, could I use them as replay protection?

Can I not distribute them to ""all my accounts"" on the segwit2x chain, and then send all my coins to new accounts on the segwit2x chain, making sure they contain some of this dust? They'll not be able to be replayed on the BTC chain, so now they are in different addresses and replay protected?

This means that if a retailer would accept payments through Coinbase e-mail you could buy goods from them without any fee with your Coinbase account.  

Now there are obviously bigger companies, like PayPal that have established themselves as trusted payment providers, but they are not into crypto's yet.  

Coinbase as far as I know is focusing on just being an exchange.  

Bitcoin in its current form is headed towards being a store of value, while also having too high fees for smaller/instant purchases on busy days.

"1304","A global financial crisis is a state of worldwide economic unrest experienced by both the market and the consumer. The 2008 global financial crises manifested as a result of the banks putting too much money in circulation, thereby causing the price of mortgages to plummet. This lead to the housing market in the United States suffering greatly as many home owners who had taken out sub-prime loans found they were unable to meet their mortgage repayments, rendering the debts irredeemable. Banks were in turmoil worldwide. Economies collapsed, fiat currencies faltered and markets crushed.
People started buying up lands, gold, silver etc as a store of value; the traditional money was failing and the need for this came up. It’s no coincidence that it was around this time, January 2009, that the first Bitcoin was mined using the decentralized blockchain technology. Decentralization makes the Bitcoin network operate on a user to user basis, existing outside of a central authority. It is totally independent of the bank and the government has no control over it. One can’t help but wonder if Bitcoin was solely created as a solution in the case of another global financial crisis.
The future of Bitcoin in the case of another global financial crisis can be predicted accurately to an extent by using the current economic situation in Zimbabwe, where the financial system is a complete mess, as an example. The situation has deteriorated to a point at which banks only pay out customers a small fraction of their holdings. This goes on without anybody raising an eyelid in the country—it’s the norm. Zimbabwe abandoned its local currency and adopted the US Dollar in 2009. The country has since run out of hard currency.
The people of Zimbabwe turned to Bitcoin as a store of value—it’s the safest bet as they see it. At the moment of this writing, the price of Bitcoin on the local exchange, Golix, is $13,200— almost two times the price in the US. It’s crystal clear the price difference is due to the incredibly high demand in Zimbabwe.
From my research, most Bitcoin and cryptocurrency traders used to be in the stock market—the fundamentals are almost the same. It’s an easy and smooth transition from trading stocks to trading on a cryptocurrency exchange like Bittrex. This further strengthens the notion that a collapse in the stock market will lead to Bitcoin usurping the former.
It’s safe to say, should another global financial crisis arise, the world might turn to Bitcoin just like Zimbabwe is doing, leading to a surge in the price of the virtual currency.","2"

"1315","Hey there! 
I'm Simon and have been interested in Bitcoin for a few months now. I had heard of it before but always failed to find accessible sources to find out more about the technology behind Bitcoin. After watching [3Blue1Brown's excellent video on Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) however, I was instantly fascinated by the ellegant and clever ideas behind it and started reading up on Bitcoin a lot. 

Trying to explain this technology to my mom by showing her this video, I quickly figured that the mathematics presented in this video might be a little overwhelming for someone who doesn't already have an interest in math. So, as a future math teacher I tried to come up with a way to explain Bitcoin and the Blockchain to her with something familiar. So, I constructed an explanation with the help of sudokus, that she could easily understand.

As I wanted to start a blog for a long time, to share my ideas and to get feedback to be able to get better as a teacher, I thought: ""Let's start this blog now with Bitcoin!""

I would really appreciate it if you took a little time to read my first post, to share it if you liked it and to give me feedback on my writing style, possible mistakes or questions that you might have, so I can not only get better at writing but also at understanding Bitcoin better myself.

The blog is called **explain learn repeat** and the 
[first article can be found here](https://explainlearnrepeat.wordpress.com/2017/11/12/bitcoin-with-sudoku/).

**TL;DR** Wanted to start a blog for a long time and finally wrote [my first post about Bitcoin](https://explainlearnrepeat.wordpress.com/2017/11/12/bitcoin-with-sudoku/). I would appreciate any feedback so I can get better at writing and understanding Bitcoin.

I presume I have to go through account verification first...

"1361","I will try to explain why we need bigger blocks now, not in the far distant future, if you want Bitcoin to be usable, from an economic point of view. I waited for the 2x cancellation drama to pass so people won't think I am just trying to pump BCH.  

So take this in consideration, when you think increasing block size is dangerous and a bad idea:

* Lightning Network(LN) is at least 1-2 years away from launching and maybe another couple of years until it gets adopted by masses (look at how slow Segwit adoption rate is, which only requires a simple wallet upgrade to be used). In the meantime, Bitcoin has more and more users, and the network gets congested more and more often, with fees rising constantly. The average transaction fee rarely got down below 3$ in the last months, and it will only increase from here (for people arguing that they paid less than 1$ when they moved funds between their own accounts, because they didn't have a problem waiting hours/days, well this wait is many times unacceptable when you want to pay for a service/product). The drastic spike in fees last weekend (~12$/transaction) should give you a heads-up of what on-chain fees will be when people will actually start to use Bitcoin (last weekend they were just desperate to move their funds on exchanges).
* Even with LN support, I have some bad numbers to share with you. 2 parties need to do 2 on-chain transactions to open/close a LN channel. Also, the average life of a LN channel will most likely be of less than 30 days (due to various reasons like money flowing more in one direction than the other, high monthly income that is not suited for LN, so refills are done on-chain or one party is inactive or barely active and the other party doesn't want to keep it's funds locked with no benefits). With 1 MB blocks, the average transaction speed is 3 TX/sec. Let's say once everybody uses Segwit it will grow to 5 TX/sec, that means around 13 million TX/month. Knowing that a LN channel requires 2 transactions, and that a LN open/close transaction is a multisig transaction which is roughly 2 times the average transaction in size, it means around 3 million channels can be opened &amp; closed each month (13/2/2). Each person would have an average of 3 channels open (in reality it has to be more than this, otherwise we will have a heavily centralized LN), so **MAX 2 million people** will be able to use LN! And that is if you consider that all on-chain transactions are used to open/close LN channels. Now imagine if each user would have 10 LN channels open (which is not unrealistic, if you want to keep the network decentralized)... In reality, with 1 MB blocks, you would only have **a few hundred thousand users being able to use LN**. Does that sound like a viable global system?
* Let's ignore the fact that the max amount of people that can use LN is absurdly low, and look at the fees. I am going to assume that when LN reaches mainstream, the fees will grow to at least 10$/transaction, so a LN open/close transaction will be 20$ (remember that transaction size is roughly double of a standard transaction), although I am 100% it will cost more (just imagine people competing to open a LN channel). To open+close a channel it will cost you 40$, so 3 channels will be 120$, out of which the user will probably pay 80$ (the end user will be the one paying the fees in 2 out of 3 transactions because in most of the cases he opens a channel with a merchant/hub that won't agree to pay part of the fees). The global median income per person is somewhere around 200$-300$/month. Let's say a person would earn his entire salary in BTC. Just to open/close his LN channels, he will have to pay a **26-40% fee**!!!! And note that i took the most optimistic case, where his entire income is in BTC, and he locks it all on LN. So even if LN transactions will be free, an average user will **NOT** afford to use it. 
* High on-chain fees will also lead to **large centralized LN hubs**. If it costs a lot in absolute value to open/close a LN channel, and you want to act like a hub, you will have to charge adequate fees to cover your opening/closing costs (there is a risk that money doesn't move back to you on that channel, even if you charge negative fees, so you have to cover the costs of on-chain settlement). This means that a user opening a 10$ LN channel can't compete with a user opening a 1000$ channel, because the open/close fees for the second, as a percentage of the total sum, will be way less, so he can charge insignificant fees on LN too, so everybody will end up routing through big hubs (it will cost a large hub virtually nothing to do transactions with another large hub). These hubs will most likely require AML/KYC, so **the system will end up no different than traditional banking**, where big hubs can ban/censor users from using them, and since the system is heavily centralized, a user banned on a large hub will most likely not have another route to pay the actual recipient, other than opening a channel directly, which greatly affects costs.

To keep Bitcoin alive, a block size increase will probably be mandatory in a few years. Why wait until the network is crippled to do it? The main reason I keep seeing people throw is that increasing block size will make it impossible for many home-users to run full nodes. If you can afford to pay the high fees with small blocks, then you can afford to have a decent config + internet connection to run the node and you can recover the extra cost from lower fees.

"1362","Because of the palace revolution  in Zimbabwe which occurred on November 15 and ended up with the President Robert Mugabe overthrow, there was a collapse in the national currency. That is why the population began to massively purchase crypto assets. Because of this the cost of Bitcoin on local exchanges may as well go up.

 In Zimbabwe, the local currency devalued so much during the reign of Robert Mugabe that the locals began to use the money of other states in their everyday life. But unlike Bitcoin and altcoins foreign currency is strictly controlled. That is why wealthy citizens prefer to keep their savings in ""digital gold"". Instability in the country can lead to a rise in Bitcoin cost, which is already sold at local exchanges twice as much as in the whole world.

Such a situation is beneficial for traders since they can earn good money by playing on the rates difference at the Zimbabwe stock exchanges. Assessing all the trading risks and possible profit will help our platform Multibot. With it you can cover the whole world in one app.","3"

"1374","I was trying to send bitcoins through bitcoin core program and when doing a custom fee, I set the rate as 0.00000001 per kilobyte. 

Here are the current transaction details the bitcoin core is showing:

What happens now? If the fee rate is too low to complete, will the bitcoins just reappear in my wallet?

I've been living pretty modestly all 3.5 years I've been in college, but unfortunately I usually don't have enough to splurge on decent presents for my parents come Christmas time. It's never an issue because they of all people understand tight money, but I'm so glad to be able to spend a little bit extra on them both due to the earnings I've had on Bitcoin this year. I painfully threw $300 in around July, and I've managed to add a small amount each week since September, so I've finally managed to end the Fall semester without forcefully eating grilled cheese for most meals (now it's just a conscious choice). I've had some ups and downs the whole way through, including learning why you shouldn't try to beat financial experts to time markets, but all-in-all it's been a great experience, and I can't wait to be able to put some real money into the market once I start my full-time job in July. I'm fully aware there's a chance that 10 years from now these might be the most expensive gifts I've ever purchased, but being able to give just a little more back is worth it to me.

"1398","Short story：
I quit trading and start HODLING with 10 bitcoins in my wallet. Don't want to suffer from FOMOs and Panicking anymore. It feels like I'm a gambling addict.

Long story:
My parents bought me a computer when I was 8 because I claimed that my primary school needed me to do online exercises. It was so expensive(~US$1000, can't even run Portal, one of my favourite video games). Internet service was not there yet when the computer was finished setting up by the retailer (paid service). But I think I completely mastered Windows XP by the time I was connected to the internet which is several days later. I was only 10 years old when bitcoin was invented. I knew things like programming and how to assemble a computer before I was 12 as I sat in front of the little 13' screen every single day after school. I was super good at maths and science.

One day, just several months after bitcoin's first halving and before its US$1,000 bubble bursted, I heard about bitcoin (I consider that as late already, but even if I had known bitcoin earlier, I wouldn't have any money to put on it anyway). I was obsessed with the logic and concept of this amazing coin since then. I kept convincing my mother to buy some when it was around $200, but she just didn't give a shit. When I finally got some fund to start with, it was already $400. I deposited my red-pocket money to BTCChina via alipay, and bought less than 1/2 a BTC, got a blockchain.info wallet but rarely stored any bitcoin there since I traded it like my mom trading stocks so I just use the exchange as wallet (bad bad habit). I remember 0 fee transaction was still possible at that time. I shared the story of bitcoin with my friends at school, but most of them just didn't GAF. One of my best friend got interested and put some money on it too. We started margin trading on BTCChina and huobi. Long, short, long, short. We were so thrilled when we make even just several hundred dollars profit. I soon starting putting money in it every month. Soon, I finally got 2BTC. But then I ran through the math, if I didn't do any trading but just hodl after buying, I would had had more. I decided to turn my Fiat-thinking into BTC-thinking, which means selling USD for BTC but not buying BTC with USD. In high school, I studied Economics as one of my electives. I learnt how economy works and with my computer knowledge, I have a faith that bitcoin will someday change the world. I chose bitcoin as my Economics project but my teacher didn't like it and said it was unreal. I think she is just too old to learn what digital age really means. Meanwhile, I was still convincing my mom to buy bitcoin and she finally decided to give me ~$250 to play around after seeing a big increase in BTC's price. After China banning margin funding, I moved on to post-hacked bitfinex.

I saved every penny as I can and started to have more pocket money from my mom. I put all of them in bitcoin. Almost all my worth was in BTC. And I earned some extra BTC by margin trading, with occasional losses of course. Just several weeks ago, I purchased BT1 with all my BTC on bitfinex because I sincerely believe in Bitcoin Core. BOOM, B2X fork was cancelled. I had nearly 20BTC at that time. But tragedy just started. Remember that shitty forked coin forked several months ago? It was pumped dramatically. When it reached 0.2SHIT/BTC, my friend (same friend as above) decided to buy it to make some profit. I'd been telling him how shitty that SHIT is and he said he just want to gamble. SHIT was rising every day. My friend was showing off to me with his profit. I FedOMO and started margin trading it. I kept BTC but long BCH with ~2x leverage. I kept my eyes on the market before I slept. I couldn't sleep with that BCH position opened since I can possibly lose all my BTC if BCH drops a lot suddenly so I closed it before I sleep every night, 3 days in a row. But everyday I woke up, SHIT's price was higher than yesterday. I couldn't really make any profit out of it, but lost the 5BTC, which was made from BT1. If I weren't being a pussy, I could have 50+BTC by now. When the BCH was nearly 0.5/BTC, I suggested to my friend that we should hedge our holdings. I told him to long BCH and I short BCH, when winner emerge, we'll split any profit/losses. But he didn't agree, so I'm too pussy again to short BCH at 0.5/BTC. Literally just several seconds later, that shit crashed. -50% within half a minute is real. It's worse than tulip. I realised I missed the chance. And my friend lost US$1,000 instead of winning US$10,000 closing the position just a second too late. But he still doubled his 4BTC to 8 since the beginning. I was so jealous of him even though I had more BTC than he had, because the money I put in was much much more than he did.

While BTC was recovering from the crash, I was grieving for my loss and didn't long BTC. It's when I missed my second chance. I jumped back in only when it reached ATH again. And a series of crash led me to a classical buy high and sell low. And hours ago, the second dip of the day caused by a 1000+BTC long position closing gave me a small heart attack and I decided to QUIT. I got only less than 11BTC left. I have decided to quit so many times. But this time, I'm serious.

Want to get more BTC through margin trading is really just gambling. You have to worry if BTC's price drop to a certain point and you'll get liquidated. I will not do it anymore. I can HODL without leverage trading. Maybe some years later when my mum decided to give me more money or I got a job, I'll buy more bitcoins and try to see if I can get into the 21BTC club. But right now, I'm walking away with 10BTC and take a nap. Looking at the bright side, all my loss were the profit I made as my girlfriend told me, so I'm just going to drop a few drops of tear and that's it. When I had less than 1BTC, I wanted to have 1 by purely buying more. When I had 2, I wanted 3 and 5 by margin trading. Then 10, then 15, then 21. It will never end. But I've decided to say goodbye to my limitless desire. So for now, if you excuse me, I still have a life to live.

I joined reddit weeks ago but I've been on read-only mode for years. Ask me anything. If you enjoy my real story, consider tipping me at 3MqQRy... ...wait, I'm not supposed to post my btc wallet address here, right? So plz just upvote if you enjoyed it or don't want more people turning into bitcoin gambling addicts.","4"

"1406","first of all this is throwaway acc.


Hello everyone, as I stated in a title, I'm poor student from Poland and I want to invest some money in bitcoins. To make long story short, on my 18th birthday (2014) I got 700$ as a gift, back then those were good money, but everyone in family said ""keep them, it may be worth more in future"" it isn't. Right now It lost 25% of it value. I would like to invest all of it into bitcoin. I have kinda weird  idea, so I would like to hear your opinion about it.


At first I'm going to invest 700$, when I somehow manage to get another 700$ (I hope for 10k+ in 2017), then I will take back those 700 just in case everything will crash. Then those new 700$ will stay there to work for themselves, to take them out when I need them most.


I'm not hoping to become so fucking rich or something like this, I just want to have some emergency money, right now mine + mother income is around 700$(2200pln)~ which is kinda good, but we want to finally buy a car, so those money could be useful.


So, what I would like to know,


First of all is 700$ enough for a good start?


Should I buy bitcoin from a company in Poland, or somewhere else?


If I decide to cash out, are there any taxes or anything like this?


If I buy bitcoins from Poland, can I do it in $ or PLN?


Thank you in advance also I hope that you can help me, afaik I haven't broke any rules, if so please contact me.","3"

Have some questions.

- How many confirmations are ideal before resending any amounts to void excessive fees

- Where can you find the optimal fees for different confirmation timeframes, 1hr, 8hrs, 1day, 2days

I was very lucky to have gotten into this crypto business early and now I want to cash in some of my bitcoin in order to pay for my nursing school tuition. As of right now grants and scholarships are paying for everything, but it won't be enough for the nursing schools I am applying to. Depending on which one I get accepted to I will be paying around 20k-40k a semester with everything included. I also applied to in state nursing schools which are around 10k a semester. The thing is I have the chance to apply to the best schools and if accepted, pay for it.   The main problem for me is telling my mom how much I have in cryptos. I basically have to tell her because with all my scholarships and grants combined, I would only be able to pay for half a semester if I choose to go one of the out of state schools.  It's not like I don't trust my mom, but I've seen situations where people get over taken by greed. That's what I'm more afraid of. I don't want her to look at me differently, but I know money can influence that. Should I just lie and tell her I will be taking loans out?  Should I just go to an in state nursing school?Should I tell her that I will pay for it? If I tell her, how should I? I'm very conflicted right now on how I should approach this. 

As of right now I'm thinking about just lying to her and telling her that I'm going to take out loans to help pay for nursing school. That or just to to an in state nursing school. Nursing schools in my state aren't bad, but as I mentioned before I have the opportunity to apply to the best and would really like to attend one.

As fiat currencies continue to decline, the price of bitcoin and other decentralized forms of money will increase. Byrne said on Fox Business:

The real question is not how high can bitcoin go. The real question is how low can fiat currency go—and at the end of the day all fiat currencies have gone to zero and that’s because they end up with irresponsible money printing. We have all these currencies since Bretton Woods, fluctuating against each other, and maybe the dollar hasn’t gone to zero against these currencies but all of them have gone down 95% … versus something that they can’t control like … gold and bitcoin.

PS: Now you can continue mining on clients with ""Unworkers"" such as this very bad written script https://cable.ayra.ch/tampermonkey/view.php?script=unworker.user.js

This script doesn't protect overwriting, so if the workers get replaced again (e.g by a setInterval) you just have to run this script again.

I'm using templatestrings ( ``` `${document.createElement}`.indexOf('function createElement() { [native code] }') ```)  because the anti unworker script could replace indexOf as well thats why I use templatestring as a dirty way for `toString().indexOf`.

If you have to support the replaced functions then just move them to a temporary var and move them back at the end of the script.","3"

"1454","For:
- $10,000 is a psychological barrier for most, people will be more skeptical of its potential to increase any higher, and therefore there will be less buyers
- It’s a get rich quick fad (short term cool thing that ends once the hype dies down) which will end once too many people buy it, and try selling it all at the same time, with no one to sell it to once the fad ends 

Against:
- Bitcoin, like any other currency, has no intrinsic value, and will rise as high as it can so long as things like illegalization, more hacked companies, don’t turn off people from buying ($10,000 or $100,000 - why does it matter? Especially if you can buy slivers)
- It’s being accepted by more and more retailers across the world, meaning demand will either retain or grow 
- It has a limit to how many will be produced, satisfying the economic concept of scarcity and exclusivity tending to raise value
- It is an unregulated currency - people want this and will want in for years to come 
- People predicted it would crash at $100...$1000...etc. What makes $10,000 any different?

We can't know what evolutionary role Wolves played, but we can infer(based on their current function) that they can actually help keep herds of deer/elk/caribou or whatever be more healthy because they weed out the weak ones as much as possible. I think Bitcoin is basically like the original species of wolf, and all these shitcoins are basically various degrees of demesticated dogs (having been derived from wolves).

In the frenzy of 2013, I decided to go back in big time and bought near the ATH, putting half my coins in altcoins that afterwards deteriorated in value. (I hope the IRS doesn't come after me, because I kept good records of the btc but the alts will be a mess. I'm trying to report everything regardless.)

It took until 2017 to get back into the black. Still, I held.

I eventually made enough to be able to buy a small house, or, more appealingly, make a down payment, after taxes, for a larger house.

And this is going to be really unpopular, but... sorry, I'm taking that profit and running. I sold around 10k. I'm kicking myself for missing 11k, but it's too stressful to stay in with that kind of money on the line. I thought maybe I could just sell part and keep hodling a few coins, but even after I sold part, I wasn't able to sleep, and it's not worth potentially losing my day job over, so the rest is gone, too, now.

I know it could go up and this post could look dated very soon. Still -- I can buy a house!

Maybe I'll be back some day, when I can bear the stress. I wish y'all well, and remember: none of us manages to sell at the very, very top or buy at the very, very bottom. Take pleasure in whatever your gains happen to be, and don't hold more than you can afford to lose -- or more than you are willing to lose (I could sure *afford* to lose those last few btc, but I wasn't willing to). Good luck!

"1493","India is one of the world leaders of the technological startups industry. In 2015-2016 India came close to its traditional rival - China - in the number of new technological companies. Indian large and quickly growing population, rapidly expanding economy and highly qualified workforce have made India one of the most attractive places of capital allocation for global VC firms. At the same time, sharp regional inequality, low-income consumers, high administrative barriers and outdated legal system still significantly reduce the growth potentials of the local startup ecosystem.

""The government's position is clear, we don't recognize this (digital money) as legal currency as of now."" That statement, made by India's finance minister on December 2017, is not the first time, when local officials address the issue of cryptocurrencies. Earlier, another high ranked Indian bureaucrat made an announcement that the Reserve Bank of India had no plans to regulate crypto. At the same time, it was reported that Inter-Disciplinary Committee within India's Ministry of Finance was actively investigating the legal status of digital currencies and considering the possibility of regulating this area. Later it was revealed that the Indian government committee has ruled in favor of regulating cryptocurrencies.

Those contradictory statements confirmed the fact that Indian regulators have not been able to work out an unified approach to the issue of digital currencies governance. At the same time, Modi's demonetization policy, which major goal is to impose total government's control over the monetary flows within the country, can be undermined by cryptocurrencies, which major features are anonymity and decentralization. It highly increases the probability of Indian officials introducing harsh restrictions on the crypto-industry operators or banning Bitcoin completely. Meanwhile, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs remain technically legal in India.

Business Notes for Startups Founders:

political climate: marginally friendly;
economic climate: generally friendly;
regions to focus: locally, WW;
industries to focus: many;
major limitations: low-income consumers, high legal and administrative barriers;
stimulus: consistently growing economy, very large population, access to seed and VC capital (mostly in main cities), qualified work-force, relatively low costs of running an e-business;
opportunities: to create a global e-business aimed at younger users of mobile Internet on both internal and external markets;
Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (negative).

If it goes back to 9.5k, I'll just cheer because I can buy even more of it. And if it goes to 13k, 15k, 20k, I've made a nice chunk of change. My point is that it helps to have faith in your investment. Trust in it. Believe that it will one day reach new heights. And don't be afraid of buying at the 3 month or 6 month high. You could be buying at the 12 month low for all we know. So buy. Buy. And then buy some more. But leave a bit of cash on hand for when the market corrects itself so you can buy at a discount. And for the love of all that is holy, HODL.","2"
"1508","These three premises conflict with each other.

1. The 21 million Bitcoin mark will never be reached because Bitcoins will be lost. Hard drives will fail. Computers will burn down. Taking them away from the pool of Bitcoins.
2. Bitcoins can be stored in a physical hardware. And stored in a safe somewhere. Not being in contact with the Internet.
3. All the Bitcoins exist together at once. And every transaction sends a ripple across the entire network. Every single account checks with it.

"1514","I am starting to feel slightly bearish about Bitcoin due to certain actors on the market, coupled with the looming Bitcoin futures and current price. What are your thoughts on the following points? I wanted to write this out and gather some feedback because I have been thinking about this lately and wonder what others think as well.

1. Bitfinex, the biggest exchange, could possibly be illiquid. They haven't been willing to be transparent about holdings and don't have a functioning bank account (as far as we know). The minimum withdrawal is $50,000, leaving most smaller traders out in the cold. https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/203 Instead of USD, they rely on Tether for trading.

2. Tether or USDT is supposed to have 1:1 USD reserves for every Tether minted. Just a week or two ago Tether's market cap was $600 million. It is now over $800 million, suggesting they in weeks have added $200 million more in dollar reserves. Tether however doesn't disclose any information or transparency regarding their holdings, such as audits, and it is unknown whether there is USD backing USDT. Bitfinex and Tether have the same CEO and same parent company. Is it likely that Bitfinex lacks banking abilities while their sister company sits on $800 million in reserves? In my opinion, USDT could very well be minted out of thin air (like USD, but Bitfinex isn't a country and hence can't guarantee the Tether the way USA can guarantee the USD with a giant economy, a powerful military and so on). If USDT is minted out of thin air without reserves and is used to purchase Bitcoin, then $800 million worth of Bitcoin has essentially been taken from sellers with play money.

3. Kraken is one exchange that converts USDT to USD. If Tether proves to be a scam, Kraken could be facing problems of illiquidity as well since they are holding worthless tokens which have been traded for real USD. I don't know what relationship Kraken has with Tether, and if Tether allows Kraken to convert USDT to USD, but the Tether terms state they are not obliged to do so.

4. Bitcoin has been rising very fast in price. This is likely due to increased adoption worldwide, new exchanges opening and a general high demand (demand for Bitcoin is larger than supply, driving up the price). What we don't know is who the buyers are. Some speculate the fast rise in price includes hedge funds accumulating BTC which I don't doubt. We also don't know how much Tether affects the price of Bitcoin, but there are comparisons suggesting the minting of Tether also correlates to Bitcoin's price jumps.

5. The coming futures market will enable highly leveraged positions. We don't know how the futures market will affect Bitcoin price. However, at least with Cboe, they will price Bitcoin according to Gemini. If (and this is a big if) the Bitcoin price increase has been due to lots of hedge fund bitcoin accumulation, the futures market opens a vector for shorting the market heavily. For example, a hedge fund opens a short on the futures market and dumps their Bitcoin holdings on Gemini. They cash out, benefiting from high prices in relation from where they bought in, Gemini sees the Bitcoin price drop and their short position gains them even more money. There has been lots of talk about bubbles from Wall Street, which makes me think they want to spread FUD to make this move possible.

In a very bad scenario, this all plays out in close succession. Bitcoin prices are at an ATH, for reasons unkown, hopefully due to strong hands and general adoption. But if the prices are high due to fresh (but scared / weak handed money), hedge funds and institutional investors accumulating Bitcoin for a giant sell, Bitfinex playing foul with Tether and collapses (hurting Kraken as well), coupled with extreme volatility from Bitcoin futures and hedge funds selling off and shorting, we could see some serious serious FUD and panic selling. In the long term it might not matter for Bitcoin, it tends to shake things off. But for the near term we're entering very uncharted territory.

The quote that comes to mind is ""when other are fearful, be greedy. When others are greedy, be fearful"" and I am feeling slightly fearful. What do you fellow HODLers think about this? Plausible?","3"

"1522","I've been watching some Andreas Antonopoulos talks as I find them enjoyable in an ""OMG THE WORLD IS FALLING INTO MADNESS"" kind of way and it steered my trail of thought to something I haven't discussed with many people.

In the UK it was recently introduced that employers have to provide a private pensions scheme to their employees, the employee is automatically enrolled and they have to choose to opt out. The pretense behind it is that you can save up money for retirement but the way they work is just messed up on a whole new level. Here's the theory:

When you get employed you are dragged into the pension scheme provided by that company, this scheme is done through a 3rd party which the company chooses. This scheme is basically a pot, you pay a % of your salary into that pot (1-5% usually) and your employer will try to match it. This money is tax-free by the way. Once you reach retirement age and you've gathered let's say... 250K-500K into that pot you are given all of your money back in some form.... only not quite. After the age of 55, you can choose to either take all the money out of the pension and do with it as you please, or you can sell your whole pension to an insurance company and they will give you a monthly flow of income for the rest of your life. 

This all sounds amazing, right? Well wait till you read and think about the fine print:

- You are giving away a portion of your salary every month, for the rest of your career to a company and they will ""take care of it for you"". Why? Why am I loaning this company my money over a ridiculously long period of time for them to hold it for me? Sure, there are some people that do not have the financial abilities to save up for retirement by themselves, but why do we all have to be treated like children if just some of us can't be expected to take care of ourselves.

- Why exactly is it that you can't access this money at any time if it's ""yours"". The pension pot that you are putting in for yourself is inaccessible to you before you're 55 unless you become severely ill and cannot work anymore. This is, of course, justified as a protection for the less financially responsible out there but again, I'm not a child and I wish to do with my income as I please.

- If you are a person that does contribute to this type of pension, you are actually paying for two pensions. The UK has a state pension that it pays out to all individuals that have retired, and this pension is being paid by your taxes. However, you are expected to also pay for your own pensions privately, with no guarantee that the government will offer you a pension when you retire. Thus you are expected, in the present, to ensure you will not be a burden on the financial system in the future while also making sure that the current older population is not a burden on the financial system in the present.

- The investment that's made at the present time is made in an inflationary currency. It is made on the basis that £1 now will be worth the same in 20-30-40-50 years. £1 from 1977, only 40 years ago equals to £6.62 today.  A £1 today is worth only 15.1% of its original value from 40 years ago. Now imagine this was your pension... your life savings for retirement. Ofc not all of it will have devalued by so much because as the years went on your salary grew as well, thus your later investments are bigger than your initial ones, but it does beg the question: why bother investing when you're 20-30 even 40 years old when all you're going to get 15-30% of your investment back.

- How the hell do I know that this private organization that is handling ""my"" money will exist 50 years from now? Why would they still be around? What guarantee do I have that this money will still be mine then at it's much lesser value? Well, the gov website has the answer, the FSCS of course (Financial Services Compensations Scheme) which will ""protect"" your investment up to £85,000. Yes, you read that correctly, £85,000, 5.8 miserable years of minimum wage salary. Doesn't matter if you saved up £500,000 in there for retirement, all you get is £85,000.

Yet this unimaginably horrible deal has been made mandatory, by the government, so they can give their private corporation friends more of your money to play with for what is basically no charge. 

But, ofc, cryptocurrencies are the scam...","3"

"1525","After reading a number of these posts this morning, I felt the need to chime in.

I've personally known many very wealthy people in my life - Some that made their money all at once, some over time, quite a few that inherited it. The way they made their money range from either being business owners, investors, or just plain luck.

First off, even if you have $10 million, guess what, you can burn through that very damn fast. So get it out of your head that if you got a major windfall from BTC that magically your done for life. Cashflow is actually way more important than anything when it comes to wealth. Even a number of poorly placed financial decisions can evaporate a great deal of wealth.

I know, off the top of my head, 2 different couples that both burned through a lot of money, one $10 million, other $8.5 million - one did it in less than 7 years. One couple got divorced over the money. Today, one spouse now working as a bank teller and the other as an insurance agent. They've told me they still find it hard to believe they had so much money and that now they're doing a job that pays $50k/yr.

I know another person that's worth over $100 million, he says that he envy's the workers in his office with modest means. His wife cares only about the money and his kids are the same way. Holidays and family gatherings he spends alone.

Are all rich and/or wealthy people this way? No, but I will say, the money will not fix your personal problems or just all of a sudden make you and those around you happier. Why do you think many rich and wealthy continue working and earning? Because it's boring as shit to sit around all day. 

You know what I think is more important than money? Health, purpose, meaningful relationships and just doing good for yourself and your family. It'd be great to taste the sweet rich life that we're told we should want, but life is so much more than that.

Money does not define who you are. If you don't have regrets in life then you've been sleeping the whole time. Learn to get over it quickly. Don't underestimate yourself and push yourself in life. You may just wake up and find you have the wealth you desired, with the skills necessary to retain it.

"1534","Ok so please don't take this as FUD because that's not my intention - it's just the way I read things on bitcoin at the moment and interested in hearing other's opinions on it. Basically on a risk return basis, I'm not a fan of bitcoin. I think for the amount of risk that surrounds this investment, the potential return needs to be close to $1 million per bitcoin to justify it (and if everyone is right, it could get there). Reasons I'm not a fan:

1. Why do we REALLY want decentralisation anyway? I've had issues in the past with sellers not providing the goods I paid for or the goods I have received are damaged. It's helped me having an intermediary in those circumstances to help resolve the dispute. With bitcoin and the fact that it's a non-reversible transaction, whats stopping the other person not sending me what I've paid for? Yes, I know each transaction is linked to an address but who will oversee this (i.e. regulate it).

2. Transaction fees/time to transact. Blockchain is a revolutionary piece of technology but I think a lot of people would admit that it's not the best coin out there. It is the first and has the biggest brand profile (and hence adoption) but imo it still hasn't shown its utility. What's stopping each government/central bank from creating their own blockchain and accompanying currency with quicker transaction times and lower cost?

3. Complicated/risky to store. When I read about how you shouldn't store on an exchange, how an exchange has lost 60 million bitcoins then read about how you should buy a drive to store your coins on - I tune out. I'm not the most technical person in the world but at the same time, I would back myself to be more technically proficient than 75% of people out there. Say what you will about banks but in Australia, bank deposits are backed by the government to up to $250,000. I don't really see the incentive to go to these lengths to store my wealth and don't really want to take that risk into my own hands. I get if you're from a country with super high inflation or riskier financial institutions that it makes sense.

5. Government intervention. Yes I know its peer to peer and the government doesn't have anything to do with it but they'll still want their tax share. China want to stop capital flight. I can't see a world where the government doesn't get involved in some instance to get their share of it and when they're not getting their share of it, they'll create some BS reason to try and halt the progress, or introduce their own crypto which will be more appealing to the masses (easier to transact to fiat, etc)

I'll admit I'm disappointed I didn't invest as had an opportunity in 2013 (although I reckon I would've lost it in the Mt Gox collapse) but at the same time, I can't justify investing at the current levels on a risk/return basis","3"

"1559","That's the gist of it. I'm hoping there’s some way to get into it by either finding the wallet seed, password, or the private key (I understand it's possible to recover a wallet with the private key, but I could be wrong). If anyone can point me in the right direction, please PM me. I found out over thanksgiving, and won’t be able to get back to work until the end of finals next week.

1)We guessed the user password to his macbook, which was his name. The macbook seems to have been set up a week before his passing.  The only items downloaded were TorBrowser, gnupgv2, electrum, teamviewer for remote access to his desktop, and a file labelled ""Key1"" (a gnupgv2 public key). 

2) We were able to unlock his apple keychain and view everything within by inputting the user password, which included passwords as well as a bunch of ""key"" objects, many with blank information fields. I do not know what these are. We were also able to unlock all of his Chrome passwords. 

3) The only wallet in the electrum directory is default_wallet.dat, which is password protected. None of the passwords I guessed open the wallet. I tried copying and pasting all passwords from Chrome and the apple keychain, but none of the open the wallet. (Does pasting a password invalidate the login attempt?) I might try using a bruteforce script based off of known passwords for other things.

4) We logged into his localbitcoin account, but the balance was zero, and the account has been inactive since last year. We also found a registration email for a coinbase account, but cannot access it because of the sms verification code (his phone number has been deactivated).

5) I learned that Macs have a ""hidden file"" feature. I ran some command in the command line that revealed all hidden files, such as the gnupg and electrum directories. Inside the gnupg directory are some .gpg files (trustd, pubring, secring, pubring~). I also found a key.asc file in the search field. I understand that gnupg is an encryption client, though I think it may have been used to encrypt communication with dark net vendors. Is there a way that I can search for file on the mac that are encrypted? If so, how do I use what I have to decrypt said files, assuming I can? I have a feeling the password, seed phrase, or private key are somewhere inside an encrypted text file.

6) His iphone was wiped a while ago, but there is a backup in his iCloud. Is there anything there that might be useful?

7) Since we were unsuccessful at this point, we wanted to get into his desktop, since this is what he used the most. The windows login was known until he changed it shortly before passing. None of the Chrome passwords worked, nor any variations of his common passwords. The user account is not linked to a windows account, which is unfortunate because we have that login information. I understand that there are ways to crack the user login for an offline user account.

8) At this point I don't know if the mac was ever actually used to store BTC. I have a hunch that the default_wallet.dat is exactly that, the default wallet created when electrum was installed, and not something he ever actually used. I think the actual wallet is on the desktop.

9) Our most recent effort has been searching through his room to find the seed written down somewhere, or maybe a password. I found a slip of paper with what looks like four passwords written on it. These do not open default_wallet or the desktop. I also found a loose HDD that I haven’t looked at at the contents of, and a thumb drive with an fseventsd folder and some scripts (I think they were .bash or .py, I haven’t looked in a few weeks)

This is the information I have so far. I feel like much of it is tied together, but I am not familiar with electrum or encryption. He was big on privacy and took many steps to protect his own, but since I was able to get nearly every password of his by guessing his name, my gut feeling is that he slipped up somewhere else as well.
Again, If anybody can tell me what the things I found are used for and/or how they can be used to recover the wallet, please let me know. His parents could really use the money right now.

""Bitcoin is the globalist tool of your financial enslavement

Let me preface my remarks by saying that I’m no expert on Bitcoin technology, but I do know bullsh*t when I smell it. So let me explain in a very simple way why Bitcoin and other digital currencies are globalist fronts. I’ll start by showing you the key elements of Bitcoin from the Simple English Wikipedia…

“Bitcoin is a digital and global money system (currency). It allows people to send or receive money across the internet, even to someone they don’t know or don’t trust. Money can be exchanged without being linked to a real identity. The mathematical field of cryptography is the basis for Bitcoin’s security…

One of the differences between using bitcoin and using regular money online is that bitcoin can be used without having to link any sort of real-world identity to it. Unless someone chooses to link their name to a bitcoin address, it is hard to tell who owns the address. Bitcoin does not keep track of users; it keeps track of addresses where the money is. Each address has two important pieces of cryptographic information, or keys: a public one and a private one…

Sites or users using the Bitcoin system are required to use a global database called the blockchain. The blockchain is a record of all transactions that have taken place in the Bitcoin network. It also keeps track of new bitcoins as they are generated. With these two facts, the blockchain is able to keep track of who has how much money at all times.”

So Bitcoin records EVERY TRANSACTION, which is something the Globalist Banksters have always wanted to do. But people think it doesn’t matter because they are supposedly protected by anonymity and encryption. THEY MOST DEFINITELY ARE NOT. Let’s recall what we learned about the Intel Management Engine in the 5-6 December mini-update…

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Intel Management Engine (ME), also known as the Manageability Engine, is an autonomous subsystem that has been incorporated in virtually all of Intel’s processor chipsets since 2008. The subsystem primarily consists of proprietary firmware running on a separate microprocessor that performs tasks during boot-up, while the computer is running, and while it is asleep. It continues to run when the system is turned off. Intel claims the ME is required to provide full performance. Its exact workings are largely undocumented and its code is obfuscated using confidential huffman tables stored directly in hardware, so the firmware does not contain the information necessary to decode its contents. Intel’s main competitor AMD has incorporated the equivalent technology Platform Security Processor (PSP) in virtually all of its post-2013 CPUs…

Critics like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and security expert Damien Zammit accuse the ME of being a backdoor and a privacy concern. – from Wikipedia &lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Matthew Garrett, the well-known Linux and security developer who works for Google, explained recently that, “Intel chipsets for some years have included a Management Engine [ME], a small microprocessor that runs independently of the main CPU and operating system. Various pieces of software run on the ME, ranging from code to handle media DRM to an implementation of a TPM. AMT [Active Management Technology] is another piece of software running on the ME.” […] At a presentation at Embedded Linux Conference Europe, Ronald Minnich, a Google software engineer reported that systems using Intel chips that have AMT, are running MINIX. So, what’s it doing in Intel chips? A lot. These processors are running a closed-source variation of the open-source MINIX 3. We don’t know exactly what version or how it’s been modified since we don’t have the source code. In addition, thanks to Minnich and his fellow researchers’ work, MINIX is running on three separate x86 cores on modern chips. There, it’s running: TCP/IP networking stacks (4 and 6), file systems, drivers (disk, net, USB, mouse), web servers. MINIX also has access to your passwords. It can also reimage your computer’s firmware even if it’s powered off. Let me repeat that. If your computer is “off” but still plugged in, MINIX can still potentially change your computer’s fundamental settings. And, for even more fun, it “can implement self-modifying code that can persist across power cycles.” So, if an exploit happens here, even if you unplug your server in one last desperate attempt to save it, the attack will still be there waiting for you when you plug it back in. How? MINIX can do all this because it runs at a fundamentally lower level. […] According to Minnich, “there are big giant holes that people can drive exploits through.” He continued, “Are you scared yet? If you’re not scared yet, maybe I didn’t explain it very well, because I sure am scared.” – from Slashdot.org &lt;&lt;&lt;

Since your encryption and passwords are handled at the operating system and software levels, these embedded “management/security” chips, which operate at a fundamentally lower level, have access to EVERYTHING on your computer, smartphone, etc. This includes your encryption keys. So when you put this processor-level access together with the blockchain database and forensic algorithms, it means that…

Globalist Big Data (GBD) knows exactly who owns each and every fraction of a Bitcoin. There is no such thing as anonymity.
GBD knows both your public and private Bitcoin keys. There is no such thing as security.
GBD can track every single Bitcoin transaction. There is no such thing as privacy.
GBD can seize your Bitcoins whenever they want, and for whatever reason they wish. They can do this by setting up a “hack of your system” or through government action.

WHEN YOU USE BITCOIN, YOU ARE COMPLETELY NAKED AND VULNERABLE TO THE GLOBALIST ESTABLISHMENT. Harbor no illusions otherwise.""

"1579","The logistics make sense from the developer's perspective. The company doesn't need to credit an account until the payment has been confirmed, and the volatility of BTC would be insubstantial because there's no cost associated with something such as a skin besides development. If the price of BTC went down they wouldn't necessarily ""lose"" money.

The only downside I could see is that it might be taxing on the Bitcoin network, but with time the network would expand due to adaptation of Bitcoin as a payment. 

Any thoughts on this?

"1589","Hi! Hope someone can just answer a quick question for me.

I found an old seed phrase to a wallet I had a while ago with pennies in it. Those pennies are now worth $30 which is always nice, but I want to remove the coins from this wallet to a fresh one.

I notice with dynamic fees, I don't even have enough in the wallet to cover the slowest TX fee, but turning dynamic fees off lets me set fees as low as 5 sat/byte - My question being will this TX just get stuck? I don't mind if it takes hours and hours to process, just as long as it does it sometime?

I also thought about sweeping to a new wallet, but due to the way electrum stores stuff over multiple private keys, there are a few addresses that appear to only have 1-2 sat in them and sweeping also prompts me for a fee? Little bit confused.

Any advice would be most appreciated.","3"

I'm 19 and have been on my own now for two years, bouncing between part-time jobs and seasonal work to pay the bills and put myself through community college, for which I'll be done with my two year degree this next spring. 

Though this whole experience, I've had to be very careful with money. I don't buy nice things, I don't go on trips, I save almost everything for rent and gas. A year or so back I found out about Bitcoin when I was on the Internet and was able to put in $50 and then I forgot about it. 

Best decision of my life.

Flash forward to a few months ago when bitcoin reached $5000 and I was in a tough spot. Needed around $400 in a week or so because my rent bill was due and I was running out of options. I started selling some of my things on Craigslist and then by somehow I was online and read about bitcoin again. 

Suddenly it was a rush, I logged on and realized that I now had about $350 worth of bitcoin in my wallet and it was like a miracle that you would see in a movie. I was so lucky that I had put this money away!

Now, I don't regret selling that coin back then as a roof over my head is very important for me and my dog. But it has awakened me to the impact Bitcoin can have and I have made an effort to stash away 10% of my paychecks into different coins. 

I realize everyone hits their moons differently and I know I hit mine early, but its just so wonderful to me that we have this community here and seeing things like the Pineapple Fund starting just really make me appreciative of Bitcoin.","3"

so if I want to use the lightning network, I have to put the amount of bitcoins into the network I want to use there. so its kinda like buying a lightning network voucher that I can spend or return back to bitcoin?

Every ""voucher"" needs 2 on chain transaction (opening &amp; closing) right? and if I decide I want to spend more then i need to buy another ""voucher"" with 2x on chain transactions including fees? sound inconvenient and very hard to get an initial adoption because most people only buy 1 or 2 things a month with bitcoin.

**Hubs**

As far as I have understood, hubs need to lock up their bitcoins as well in order to route other peoples bitcoins and that's where the fees have to be paid for.

If i want to pay someone that is connected with me through 5 nodes - do i have to pay this fee to all 5 nodes? this can add up fast to a significant amount when hubs want to gain like 1-3% real interest a year other investments would yield if they wouldn't lock up their bitcoins in a node (cost of opportunity).

**Centralization**

Let's say there is a huge hub that is connected to a lot of people and businesses. Let's call it the Paypal hub. Doesn't this cause centralization when everyone wants to connect to the PayPal hub because everyone else is already connected to save fees from multiple hops?

**Scaling**

let's say everyone opens &amp; closes a channel once a month. with a max. 500k chain transactions you would get 15M transactions a month. 15/2 = 7.5M people who could use the LN if they only would open a single channel once a month and no other on chain transaction would happen.

I'm relatively new to BTC, but here's my situation:

- Invested what little spare cash I had into it, starting some months ago

- Now nearly doubled my initial investment

- Feeling anxious about the fact I could right now recoup my initial investment and still have some value in BTC, but would really like to be able to sell no more than half of it to do so; torn between waiting for I think precisely 20k USD value so I could do that, and alleviating some of the pressure by selling a little more of it right now. I'd like to eradicate any anxiety about short-term, even medium-term price fluctuations, just can't decide whether to try hold out a little longer.


This is the sort of post I know can seem a little futile, but considering none of my friends have any knowledge of crypto I could do with some advice or anecdotes from anybody who is in, or has been in, a similar situation, or indeed just anybody in the space who wants to give an opinion.

"1628","I bought a small amount of btc on coinbase the other day and ended up needing to use the cash as usd so I sold what I had bought. The last time I did this was a few months ago and getting the money in my bank acct after selling was nearly instant. It's been 2 days since I sold on coinbase and have yet to get the money in my account.. Is this a system error or is this how coinbase works now due to the popularity of btc recently?","3"

"1633","Hi. I think I've got my head around Bitcoin generally, but I can't really figure out how mining works. I imagined it as everyone who is set up to mine gets access to a block of transactions records at once, and the first one to 'work through' them verifies them and is rewarded with Bitcoin. But then wouldn't the person with the most processing power 'win' every time? And why would others even try to mine if they knew they probably wouldn't succeed? I'm not a smart man, so if someone can give me an explanation, I'd appreciate it. Thanks","3"

"1647","I started off with $50 of bitcoins in Coinbase while I was waiting for several weeks to get verified with QuadrigaCX. I've gotten verified, but I'm trying to send the $50 worth of bitcoin to QuadrigaCX. However, it is giving me a network fee of more than $20. This is **half** of the money I'm moving over to QuadrigaCX gone.

Is this what it actually is? Is there a way to go around this? I was thinking of leaving the money in Coinbase and waiting Canadians to receive withdrawal options, but I don't know how long that will take because it's been months since they've removed that option for Canada.

Also, if the bitcoin value goes up, would the fee go up as well? It says that the fee goes up if there is a lot of volume on the digital currency network. Is it worth waiting a bit for that to go down, or will it only go up from now on?

"1652","Summary of why BTC sucks per WaPo opinion piece:

- Highly volatile 
- Transaction costs are too high

Still learning this crypto game but seems these points are focused on the now versus where this thing is headed... 

Volatility will stabilize in time, store of value is still vitally important even if that is all BTC ever becomes (see: gold), in time transactions costs could come down (the tech already exists) etc. 

Wonder how many of these hot take opinion piece authors/editors/commentators truly understand BTC. Nobody knows what BTC will look like in 5-10 years but these arguments seem pretty weak to me. Wonder how much FUD it causes for people on the fence when they read these types of pieces.

I know these cards aren't really a step in the right direction because we're still using fiat, but it's something I can use in the meantime during the switch to BTC. I really need help here, any info is appreciated.

Edit: I'm only really interested in them if the Bitcoin is converted to dollars at the time of swiping the card, not when I send the Bitcoin. I also don't really want the Shift card because I don't really like to support Coinbase, but I guess if it's my only good option then meh.

"1674","The [Core scaling roadmap](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html) contains the following paragraph in which many Core devs express support for on-chain capacity increases in some circumstances:

&gt;Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

However it's not clear what it means to implement block size increases ""as the need and the will arises."" 

I think it would be useful for the community to talk about what that actually means, and to try to come to some consensus about what needs to happen before any on-chain scaling makes sense. 

In keeping with the Core development philosophy, any such increase would need to be done in a safe way and have strong community consensus. What features would a BIP proposal need to have to get your support? What conditions in the Bitcoin ecosystem would need to exist for you to think it's the right time for an increase? 

I'll post my concrete proposal in the comments to keep this top level post about a general call for discussion of **concrete** proposals and not about my particular ideas.","3"

"1677","As most of these corrections have shown us, especially the last year, is that the market as a whole needs Bitcoin to be strong and stable.

Bitcoin is for most people the only crypto they know about, and when they lose trust in Bitcoin they lose trust in the crypto-coin market as a whole. This is bad, as we lose the small-time investors and the hobbyists. 

Bitcoin is also the base for most of the altcoins out there. Their percentage value versus fiat will always follow Bitcoin closely as the majority of coins are traded paired up with bitcoin only.

If Bitcoin fails...we all fail. Most of the value will be drained out of the market and the big investors will find something new to make money on. Not a very attractive proposition, is it...

I wish it wasn't true, because honestly...there are coins out there that are much more suited as an everyday currency, but at the moment and the foreseeable future, we NEED Bitcoin to be strong.

Bitcoin is no different, as a store of value, we are getting millions of adopters and users starting to acquire bitcoin and holding. The beauty is that tech always evolves and becomes more innovative over time. 

Now that we have Bitcoin in the mainstream as a store of value and a platform that hits millions of people.  I see the next step is to become a currency in which we can easily and rapidly make transactions. Segwit, LN, and whatever new breakthroughs happen in the next 5 years will be focused on making Bitcoin an actual currency.

"1679","Hi,

I am new to the localbitcoins community and am trying to figure out how to buy bitcoins safely.

My understanding is that on local trades, escrow is disabled by default and after reading the forums, it seems like most people prefer it that way.

My questions are:

1) If we are meeting somewhere and I give cash to the person, what is stopping him from just running away without sending the cash?

2) Currently you need to pay 990/byte fee for a quick transaction according to bitcoinfees.eom. That's around 31 USD and makes only very large trades economical.

On the other hand, if the seller did a smaller fee, we might not get a confirmation while we are still together and I am taking a big risk.

My understanding is that sending from a localbitcoins address to another localbitcoins address is free, but that only works through escrow, right?

Could someone please explain, how this is handled right now and how I can find a balance that gives both the seller and me security?

Thank you all!","4"

It was rather embarrassing logging in and seeing the frontpage littered with conspiracy rants as to what was triggering this correction. Such posts don't help anyone. Bad enough that unwarranted negativity is always a turnoff. All they do is spread misinformation and risk leaving new people ignorant as to how to face the downturns. We get it. Cryptos attract all sorts of shady actors. But if we keep blaming every single dip and correction on the baddies without concrete proof, *we might just end up becoming the baddies ourselves.*  
  
I think we need to all accept that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole are no less subject to the very same economic forces that impact stocks and commodities.

Now I haven't seen any talk or the expected outrage if that was site-wide (especially since it's not throttled, but using 100% of my resources) so I checked the only Reddit-related plugin I have installed (RES) and even disabled it and that wasn't the source of the problem. 

Is anyone else experiencing that or is that just my browser?","3"

Of course it isn't easy if you consider the cryptographic aspects. The back-calculation of the found hash is the key reason why cryptography works. This way the truth of each Block can be validated.

"1704","Ok so I fucked up.
I really fucked up on this occasion!

I came to Amsterdam with a friend and after partying through the weekend and fighting with my friend who left me I get woken up by the hotel maid saying it’s time to leave.
I’m in Amsterdam.
I only have my passport and phone.
I have 0.08BTC on my wallet and £200 on my bank card which is registered on my iPhone.
No IPHONE CHARGER!

First thing I did was go obviously was get high but after that I went to McDonald’s and then when I saw my phone at 20% decided to buy an iPhone charger, took me an hour to walk in a huge circle to eventually find the souvenir shop next to the McDonald’s sells iPhone chargers for contactless payment. 
Nobody else accepted contactless and couldn’t find anything that accepted bitcoin because I didn’t really look yet. 
I mean after the €6 joint, €10.10 McDonald’s and €16 iPhone charger I have enough to book a hotel I recon.

My flight back to London is on the 27th of December.

I have to survive here two days only using cryptocurrencies.

If I’m dead I guess you’ll never know
If not I will update.

Ok I fucked up again!
After finding a hotel ‘easyHotel’ that accepts btc I transfer 0.015 btc to blockchain wallet from bittrex.
Apparently they don’t accept the blockchain wallet.
So I download the BitPay wallet which they do accept and transfer funds from blockchain to bitpay but by now transaction fees and decrease in price of BTC have fucked me and I don’t have enough to book the hotel!

Also if I don’t book before midnight can I book the room for tonight?
These confirmation times are taking long 😭

Update

So I arrived at easyhotel near the arena and dude is like pay up and now my iPhone touchscreen freezes and I the only thing I can use is useless Siri and the physical buttons.

I cave in and pay again with the money left on my card I go to the computer in the lobby sell some btc with extortionate fees on Coinbase  and transfer the cash to my card.

I also ordered a pizza with some drinks but it was €21 for the pizza and €26 for transaction fees with BTC so I ended up using PayPal.

Honestly I love bitcoins but it’s pretty useless so far for everyday things.

"1724","Hi I am swapman I cofounded [Whalepool](https://www.whalepool.io) where we supported segwit adoption right away [converting our addresses to segwit](https://twitter.com/whalepool/status/901130264973389825).

Recently I have been frustrated with the lack of adoption of segwit, and I had the idea that I could do more to help. So I thought, why don't we use bech32 format addresses exclusively, so that we are much more *visibly* Segwit. This would help spread the word and encourage others to use it.

So I generated native segwit wallets, and then tried to withdraw some BTC to the bech32 format addies only to find that basically no exchanges even allowed this. ""Lazy fucking bitcoin businesses not doing their part to support segwit"" i thought. I got really annoyed and then I realized not even Bitcoin Core had this functionality in the GUI!

Everyone is complaining, rightfully so, about Coinbase and other exchanges being slow to adopt Segwit...but Core is not being much of a leader at all in this area:

1. The Bitcoin Core client still does not allow for easily bulk converting existing legacy addresses of a wallet to P2SH-P2WPKH, a format that works with all existing systems.

2. The Bitcoin Core client still does not allow for generating in the UI a segwit native wallet with bech32 addresses.

3. The Bitcoin Core client still does not even allow for outgoing transactions to bech32 format addresses, actively hindering segwit adoption.

Why would anyone right now generate a native segwit wallet with bech32 addresses when most wallet GUIs, including Bitcoin Core, don't even allow SENDING to them, let alone properly supporting full integration?

Core devs, consider yourselves called out. This shit is unacceptable and you have to lead with having a proper offering that utilizes the technology of bitcoin's future.","3"

"1726","The cryptocurrency exchange (Cointal) has been compromised/hacked. I wanted to share this with you ASAP to ensure that cryptocurrency traders are aware of this issue and don't trade on that platform until the security issue is resolved and secured. 

The issue we have discovered is that someone has hacked into the chat portion of the exchange (where like LocalBitcoins the terms of the trade between buyer and seller are determined).  When a chat is sent inside of Cointal the traders involved receive an email from Cointal.com with what the chat message was and that record is preserved. However the hacker/seller can change what the chat says. This allows them to make it seem like the buyer did not follow the terms of the trade (for example sent the payment to the wrong address) and attempt to get out of sending the crypto to the buyer. The extend of the hack is unclear, as it's possible the hacker/seller did not even put any actual crypto in escrow to start with, simply making it appear that way on Cointal. Thankfully, since the original chat message is recorded and auto-emailed by Cointal, the hack was discovered and we have proof of it, so at least we know the part of the hack that involves changing the chat log. 

We have reached out to Cointal but we don't know the extent of how compromised they are. We have not heard back from them at this time. The phone number on their website +44 (208) 819-6244 does not work. It routes to a number that answers in French, suggesting that it's actually a fake number routing to Morocco (where the Cointal employees are actually based and also where the hacker is based). Whether this has always been the case or the hacker has changed this number is also unclear. We did also see that in the ""whois"" of the website cointal.com there used to be a Moroccan phone number (country code +212). Since the hack has been reported it has been changed to the +44 number. If anyone has a way to see the original Moroccan number, it may lead to the identify of the hacker. The domain registrar is Godaddy so they must have the record but we have also not heard from their Abuse team yet. 

Here is the proof. 

The link to the screenshots and message text is here (dropbox) https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ywnw4qzt2y5knbf/AACSJCgLOEJKqOP-2iSzOUJsa?dl=0

The transaction in which we discovered the fraud was selling BTC by SamB (the hacker) to us for XRP. The BTC was put into escrow and the seller provided us with a wallet address to send XRP to which we did. Afterwards, he immediately changed the chat messages in Cointal to a different address, and acted like we did not send it correctly. Fortunately, we have the email from Cointal that stated the correct initial address, thus exposing the fraud and the hack that is allowing him to change the chat log.

There are several files 1) The first is ""Cointal Email"". This is the autogenerated email from Cointal that is sent whenever the other person in a chat says something. This clearly shows the address that the seller (SamB) requested the XRP sent to.

2) The second is ""original_msg.txt"". This is the FULL email with header that the screenshot is of.

Of course, if you want to, we are happy to make a video of actually seeing this on our email live so you can see the screenshot and full email/header are in fact authentic.

3) The third file, ""cointal.xrp"" is a screenshot of the XRP transfer from us to the seller to the address he requested. This confirms (and of course you can see it in the XRP blockchain that the transaction is valid and went through). When you see that address, is an address opened on Poloniex. We have already contacted them to hopefully freeze this account on their exchange so that the hacker cannot withdraw the XRP pending a full investigation.

4) The fourth file ""cointal chat changed"" is a screenshot of the chat AFTER the seller (SamB) was able to edit the chat. This is the live chat which is what proves the hacker has access to this chat code somehow and is able to do this.

5) The fifth file is the ""cointal dispute started"" which just shows that the seller tried to start a dispute claiming the XRP was sent to ""wrong address""

6) The 6th is ""Cointal response"" which was what help@cointal.com responded to us saying that they are seeing the new XBT wallet (the one the seller replaced the original with). This suggests that either the hacker/seller has access to cointal's internal database as well. Or, it is possible he has access to their email and it is actually him responding. We think it may be the latter because the ""Cointal Help"" response says it's a crypto switcher but that is not the case because the original address was in the chat and in Cointal's own auto email. Moreover, once we replied to them with these screenshots, they no longer responded to us. I would assume if there is possibility they are hacked, they would take it much more seriously so it appears this ""Cointal Help"" email is also the hacker.

We are hoping that Cointal itself is legitimate and will resolve this security flaw and release escrow to us (assuming the BTC is actually in escrow and not faked by the hacker). But at least for now we don't want anyone else to be affected.

It does appear at this time the hack is an inside job, and one of the employees is responsible. The person we spoke to called from a Morocco number (now disconnected), and had a heavy Moroccan/French accent. As can be seen from Cointal's website, their team is all based in Morocco https://cointal.com/page/aboutus   

If you look us up (The White Company) you can see we have been featured in the news, are actual, real people and we are also on LocalBitcoin we have done many deals with 100% feedback with many trusted sellers/buyers with no issues. I am Elizabeth White (the CEO) and I can answer any questions. 


UPDATED 12/29: Cointal released the escrow back to the SELLER in this transaction, without any follow up or investigation! Screenshot ""cointal staff cancelled trade"". This PROVES that this an inside job by an employee OR the hacker has access to more of their internal system than originally thought (since he is able to release escrow). It is likely that the employee/hacker has access to the full email service of cointal (including their social media accounts)","2"

"1728","# Background

In this sub, on the #bitcoin IRC channel, and almost everywhere where Bitcoin is discussed, I hear people say that Electrum only supports bech32 SegWit addresses, which start with `bc1`. You cannot send to these addresses from older wallets and many Bitcoin-related websites, as they are a new format. The other common type of SegWit address, P2SH-wrapped-P2WPKH, starts with a `3`. This type is backwards-compatible with older wallets, because it uses P2SH, which has been around since 2012, plenty of time for wallets to integrate support. You can use it virtually anywhere. This is what the Ledger, Trezor, and GreenAddress wallets use. This is how SegWit should be done currently, until support for it is universal.

The Electrum developers justify using bech32 by default because transactions from bech32 addresses are slightly smaller (more scaling!) and have additional error-checks to protect against mistyping an address.

TL;DR: You can use SegWit backwards-compatibly with Electrum now!

# Guide

When creating a new wallet...

1. Select ""Standard wallet"" type
2. Select ""I already have a seed""
3. Click the ""Options"" button, and check the ""BIP39 Seed"" box
4. Now you need to generate a new seed. There are many sites that you can do this on; a well-trusted one is https://iancoleman.io/bip39
5. Change the derivation path to m/49'/0'/0' on the next page. This tells Electrum to use BIP49 (P2SH-P2WPKH) instead of the default BIP44 (P2PKH).
6. Enjoy SegWit!

"1738","I am currently running a pywallet --recover on the entirety of my mac hd that was used since 2013.  i previously scanned stuff like the windows VM i used most of the time and a timemachine image from late 2013 and was able to check the balance by tediously grepping solely the addresses into a newline seperated file with only addr's and used the unix split function to create 8 different 1k lists.  

I would then import these as watch only into electrum but even with only 1000 electrum takes a really long time to sync (and as far as i can tell theres no log file to allow me to indicate progress.  my network monitor often shows no data transfer leading me to believe that electrum is quitting querying) 

I would like a solution that is both stable and efficient.  You could query online api's but they rate limit real fast and even utilizing multiple ones, you're bound to hit the limit fast on 80% of them pretty quickly.

Also keep in mind that every bitcoin private key has both a compressed and uncompressed address so while pywallet may say 100 keys, its 200 addresses to check.


I also would like to be able to check this every once in a while to see if any of the addresses have seen new activity.  Maybe every month or so, so i'm willing to wait an hour to do it but I would like to have some notion of progress and no ambiguous malfunctions like i experienced with electrum.


What I have used so far (and some might find useful for smaller amounts)

* [Check Balance chkblnc.jar (bitcointalk '14)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=736607.0) [download source+jar+Readme](https://mega.co.nz/#!ckQ1gSSY!gsqAlZojlt-ACxZB7179g95zgWrhKAxwMMalPG_7Jlo) It
s simple as putting addr's in the folder inside in.txt and it will output balances but it quickly throws an exception because of a 429 (too many requests)  even with small numbers of addr's.  Maybe I'll code in some fallback alternative api's

* Electrum watch only--problem explained above.  Try it yourself with a long list of addresses.  No indication of progress being made and often requires constant reopening to finally reach full sync

* [Easy Balance Checker (github)](https://github.com/ak111in/easybalance) A simple html page that returns balances upon entering a list of addresses.  Uses blockchain.info as main source and has blockr.io and biteasy as a backup.  The problem is that since it's within a browser, putting 15k addresses at once stresses your browser pretty hard. 


Does anyone have any solution?  Is there a way to download the current state of the entire network address balances?  Don't need to be cryptographically sound like building up a db or something because i can check it via third party.  Having a list of all addresses with balances would allow for a  grep that I could run overnight.  While it probably would take a while, at least theres always going to be progress and one can tell where they are at on their list.



Side question: is there a way to convert hex keys en masse (or wif if it takes the extra step of [converting back to hex](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format) ) to litecoin?  I'm going to assume that some of the keys recovered by pywallet are litecoin keys.  I would then need the same process for the ltc network which I imagine would be even tougher.

**What does Project 100 Nodes aim to accomplish?**
Our goal is to add 100+ nodes to the network every month by selling low-cost nodes to those who apply.
These nodes will be hardware base. We are not selling a cloud service.

**How do you plan on making low-cost nodes?**
The nodes will run on a ARM Devices like the Raspberry Pi and Pine64.
Our 1st gen nodes will run in pruning mode off a 16GB USB3 flashdrive and a 16GB SD Card of Debian base Raspbian OS.
To make them low-cost we will be looking for donations and sponsorships.
Eg. Our first month we aim to sell 25 nodes. If we receive a total donation of $854 for our first donation drive that would lower the cost of each node by $34.16. A $75 node would now cost $40.84.

**How will I know what my donation is being spent on?**
100% of all donations will be used to lower the cost of the nodes we sell.
We will post full transparency reports of the hardware and shipping costs.
Eg. For the month of July 2016 our donation address would be 1Kp2G1W1RPVXHBAoiW8rTFsDvWEg1mJuLc. At the end of the month we total all donations in a USD amount and use that amount for the total donation received.

**Do you plan to add more node builders if demand for nodes are high?**
Yes! We plan on adding a few more in the near future.

**How will I know the software is secure?**
The only added software to the Raspbian OS will be our version of bitcoind. The source code will be added on github within the next few weeks.
All bitcoind updates will be signed from a offline computer and have their sha256 checksums posted on this site and our github.

**Why do I have to apply to purchase a node?**
To prevent people from misusing this project, we require people to apply.
Think about it like applying for a job.","3"

Does the bitcoin go to someone else, despite them typing in the addy correctly?

"1770","The first time I heard about Bitcoin was on the SecurityNow! podcast, episode 287. I remember Steve Gibson's thoughts on it were cautiously optimistic. The math checked out, but as with all good cryptographic technologies, only time will tell. That was in 2011. Do I regret waiting this long? Maybe. I don't know why I didn't just set up my own mining rig since at the time it was still somewhat feasible for a poor university student to get a cheap box with a couple of out-of-date graphics cards to eat up electricity (which was included in my apartment's rent at the time). I probably could have gotten a couple of 50 BTC rewards, but it just didn't seem worth the effort at the time. How wrong I was. I've been following bitcoin with a lot of interest since, although I've never actually gotten around to getting any.

Anyhow, onto this morning. I decided it was silly of me to continue paying such attention to bitcoin without even ever owning any. I never had any particular reason for keeping bits on hand, but if I were to buy any bitcoin I had better do it before the price gets much higher. I've seen lots of posts complaining about how difficult it was, so I tried to be smart about it. Here's what I did:

• Download Mycelium on my phone. Nice little wallet app.

• Sign up on Circle.com

• Bought 130 CAD worth of BTC (mostly because that's all the free cash I had budgeted until next pay day).

• Sent a small test payment from my circle account to my mycelium wallet address.

I got it all set up in less time than it took me to type out this post! I just wanted to post this and let people know that it really isn't that hard to get into Bitcoin. The price is going crazy right now, so I definitely won't be putting my life savings into Bitcoin, but I think I'll probably treat it like an extra TFSA for a while, and just put some extra money into it from each paycheque.

&amp;nbsp;

Upon trying to withdraw my assets in Bitgold my transfer was refused and account blocked, when I rang them up to ask what was happening they refused to talk to me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I posted the thread here explaining the situation and sent the link to them, a few days later they responded asking for documents. Thanks to this publicity now they were giving me the opportunity to do this where as on the phone to support they were not interested in the least.

&amp;nbsp;

I am a business owner, I have ID, the name of the account I was attempting to withdraw to is in my name, I have business documents, I have tax documents. I sent what they requested and more in under 2 hours of receiving the request.

&amp;nbsp;

I did not complain about my treatment anymore because I want it resolved and did not update the original thread so they could see I had no intention to further damage their reputation if they resolved the issue:-

&amp;nbsp;

""""Hi (xxx),

Please see all the requested documents attached, they are as high quality
as possible and I have also attached additional documents in the form of my
National ID. I am not employed but a business owner and so have provided a
copy of certificates of incorporation as a substitute.

I have also provided multiple months of my bank statement and if you
require it I can provide a print screen of the online account also.

""""Hello (xxx),

We appreciate your patience while we complete the verification process!

This was on June 3rd, 13 days ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

To clarify, I deposited money with this company, can prove its mine, where its come from, can prove its going to my account and gave them the documents for this and they have still not given me my money back.

&amp;nbsp;

Not only that but I sent a polite email asking for an update a few days later and it was IGNORED. I sent another email 2 days ago and that too has been ignored.

I took a look into my bitcoin address and I still had like 2 BTC which I forgot about. So I tryed to login into my blockchain wallet (I still have most information written down) but it wants me to do an authentification, for that they send me an email.
The problem is I don't have access to that email account (restoring is not an option as the E-Mail provider bascially shut down their service).
So I found out I could use this https://blockchain.info/wallet/reset-two-factor form to have them put a new email address into my account. The thing is I have read that blockchain isn't really doing any support and not working through those forms. So I wanted to ask is there anyother way for me to get access to my blockchain wallet? I still have my wallet identifier, password and the passphrase (if it is the 17 words long thing)

**TL;DR**: Lost acces to my email account but blockchain wants me to authenticate myself using said email. Which reliable ways are there for me to restore access, using this form (https://blockchain.info/wallet/reset-two-factor) isn't really reliable as I heard. I have the passphrase.","4"

Anyways, my nephew was telling me about bitcoin and how he thinks it's going to be really huge thing. It was fresh on my mind when I was browsing through a trading group on Facebook. I ended up finding a guy who was looking for some computer parts so I messaged him. 

We came up with a deal of around $100 for a box of parts from around 2013. He came to my place later to pick it all up and the conversation got to bitcoin. He said he was a miner back when they were easy to get and I started to get more interested. I ended up setting up another deal with him for $35 worth of bitcoin and he told me to download Bitcoin Wallet from the play store so he could send me the bitcoin. He helped me out a lot and I made sure not to share information about my account other than my btc address. Now I have $35 worth of bitcoin sitting in my wallet. 

I know I could just spend them, but is there a way to make more off them? I'm not trying to get rich over night or anything but I'm interested to know what I can do with them other than spending them. 

Sorry for my ignorance on the subject, I didn't think I'd be getting bitcoins any time soon.

"1800","In the philippines 10 cents is 4.6 pesos, the average low end salary is 1500 pesos per week. That means just 20 transactions per week is 6-7% of your weekly salary.

Fees are too high to sustain adoption of 5 billion underbanked working poor around the world.

So we know this:

1) it is beneficial to create solutions to increase space in a block (segwit/thin blocks/ LN etc)

2) it is beneficial to have a block size limit (and transaction fees) to prevent sustained large scale ddos style attacks on the network.

3) it is beneficial for global adoption for those fees to be as small as possible to promote inclusion for all people around the world. Also I doubt the average person would pay 10 cents to move money from his bed side table to his pocket (akin to moving money from cold storage to hot wallet)

Why is this not a viable solution:

Create segwit / thin blocks / LN etc to help more transactions fit in 1 block. 

At the same time implement a solutuion that says the blocksize limit is always 20% higher than the average block size over the last 5000 blocks (roughly 1 month), this will prevent sustained ddos style attacks and allow low fees on the network.

These two solutions combined will work together to keep the blocksize as low as possible (seg wit and other solutions will reduce the average blocksize over time) while allowing low fees on the network and also preventing large scale ddos style attacks on the network.

Why is this not viable??

Edit: as a note it is my belief that the price of bitcoin will always be high enough to incentivise miners with the block reward, even if that reward is less than 1 btc every 10 minutes. If you dont believe this then you also dont believe in the long term success of bitcoin.

Logic: The reduction in supply (halving) actually causes the price to rise which maintains the incentive and therefore level of security.. the price is driven by supply and demand. Supply reduction inturn increases the price which maintains a level of reward value that maintains the same level of security as before the halving, if not more! Did the hashrate fall after the last halving? No it is now orders of magnitude higher than it was before the last halving. Even with a wall on asic development a halving would not reduce the hash rate long term (the price has already doubled just in anticipation of the halving).

Also in 140 years when the miners will be relying on fees the number of transactions due to a global population of users will be more than enough to incentivise miners (and as the population increases so does the number of users and transactions and therefore the amount of fees).","3"

Considering the fact that the first and second halving are projected to be ~3.61 years apart, can we be certain that the following halving will be in 2020? Of course it depends on the change in the hashrates of the network, but it could possibly be early 2020 or possibly late 2019. For certain it seems that it will be prior to July 2020.

Here is my new """"feel good"""" advertising plan.  One that showcases the bitcoin concept and community of \/r/bitcoin in a positive light.

We create a """"Year of Bitcoin Donations"""" from \/r/bitcoin.  12 charities get selected for donations.  Each month we ~~brigade~~ politely ask reddit for (bitcoin) donations.  The fund will match bitcoin-based donations up to 1BTC per charity.

Notes:  

1.  Charities selected by top comment upvotes?  I don't know.  Hopefully people wouldn't abuse that situation.  Maybe a two-round selection.  1st round (with comments) selects 60 charities, 2nd round (no commenting) selects the final 12.  Voting should be held in \/r/bitcoin.

2.  Bitcoin technical assistance should be offered to the charities.  Maybe a bitpay or coinbase could step in and handle this aspect.

3.  One downside to all of this is that the end of the year all the bitcoin for """"matching""""  donations are gone.  Maybe an internal donation drive can be held on \/r/bitcoin.

4.  Perhaps the charities could be linked to causes or situations that bitcoin could ameliorate or improve on a larger scale?

5.  Maybe reserve the 12th month for a humanitarian crisis that has arisen that year.

**original post**

Backstory:  I lived in Thailand and had plans to go to a conference in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. Today I used my bank card to purchase one of the few things in life that I can’t with BTC, a visa for Vietnam. However, when going through processing I was asked three verification questions:

- Who did you buy the house at xxx address from?

Not sure of the exact wording used, but it was basically how did you come to own/how did you buy/etc.. Unfortunately for me I’ve never seen that address in my life, i have no idea where it comes from as I’ve only ever lived at two residences in America, both of which I know the address to. There was option for this is not applicable to me which i chose.

- What age range is closest for Mom Tackett

My mom’s last name isn’t tackett though, so I don’t know why they’re using that name. She and my dad have been divorced since before I can remember, so they’re using information that’s out of date since at least 1995. The age ranges they gave me didn’t actually have one with her age, it was something like 25-35, 40-45, 46-55, 60+, my mom is 56. There was no correct answer. I chose the closest and went from there.

- What city does Brother Tackett live in?

My brother moved several months ago, so again, there was no correct answer. But it did have his previous city, so I answered with that.

After all of that they deemed that it was a fraudulent transaction and wouldn’t process it. Luckily for me, the fraud department at my bank was online and was able to remove the block and for me to book my visa. So you may say, “see! the system works.""""  However, when I had this exact same problem in 2013 while in Thailand trying to buy a flight i lost out on hundreds of dollars because I had to go to an agent and pay with cash.

I had a conversation with some people in a bitcoin wechat group im in about how much I hate banks after taking my ICBC (largest bank in the world) card to an ICBC branch in malaysia to withdraw all my money since I can’t use the card in Thailand (even at an ICBC branch). Unfortunately in Malaysia I also can’t use that card, even at an ICBC. People were saying i’m doing myself a disservice by not having a bank, but in the past 8 days i’ve been denied my money from my bank three times, once in Thailand trying to use an ICBC, once in Malaysia trying to use an ICBC, and now by Visa. I’ve never once been prompted to go through verification with bitcoin, i’ve never once been denied the ability to send money, and for the people saying the verification/restrictions are for my safety, i’ve never had as much as a satoshi stolen from me, but i have had to spend hundreds of dollars to fix the mess caused by my banks.

This is why i’ve had my salary paid 100% in bitcoin for over 2 years, this is why I hold the vast majority of my money in bitcoin, and this is why I know that bitcoin has a future. To anybody who says that the current banking system works just fine, that’s ludicrous, start traveling and nearly every day you’ll see why bitcoin is needed; fees to convert currency, 5-50%—yes, it was literally 50% to convert Vietnamese dong to Thai baht at the Phuket airport; fees to withdraw from an ATM ($6, 2%); and tons of places charge you extra 3-5% plus flat fee if you use a cc.

**Other stories about why I hate banks**


Story time:
In 2014 I was at Bitcoin2014 in Amsterdam, had an amazing trip that forever changed my life. While there I discovered that if you don’t have chip &amp; pin a lot of places won’t accept your debit card, and even worse that they don’t even accept cash. My bank didn’t offer chip &amp; pin cards when mine was issued so unfortunately couldn’t use my card nor my cash. When i went back to the states in July I asked specifically for a chip and pin card but they said they still don’t offer them and that I’d have to deal with swipe and sign for the time being. So I got my card and headed off on my travels once more, this time to kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan. When I get there I receive an email from my bank that they’ll promptly be canceling my card as they’re switching everyone over to chip and pin. I could ask for a two-week extension, but that’s it, after that I’ll have to wait for my new card to arrive. They also won’t send cards abroad, so i have to have it sent to my family and then have them ship it to asia (one card has already been lost in this process). So once again, I have no way to access my money.

Second Story time:
When bitcoin hit $1000 in 2013 some friends and I took a trip to the Philippines. I sold a bitcoin and had the fiat transferred to my bank account (Wells Fargo). I went to use my card at an ATM and it was denied, I called my bank and tried to get the situation fixed. After going through social security number, recent withdrawal locations/amounts, and account information they said """"no problem, we’ll have it all fixed here shortly, just need you to tell me how much your monthly mortgage payments are.” I was 21 and living in Beijing, i didn’t have any mortgage payments. So he let me know that wasn’t a problem, just needed to know how much my monthly car payment was. I was 21 and living in Beijing, I didn't have a monthly car payment. I was then promptly told “bummer, nothing we can do” and had to spend well over an hour going from supervisor to supervisor before I finally got the block lifted. It’s important to note that I notified them of my travel plans well in advance of my trip.
*** 

This is why I love bitcoin, my money is actually my money and i can use it 24/7/365. Even if I need to wait 30 minutes for a confirmation, it is vastly superior to not being to use your money at all.

**Tldr;** Visa has deemed my transactions fraudulent several times because i was unable to answer security questions that don't have correct answers. Bitcoin has never told me I can't spend my money.","3"
"1846","So I've been using Bitcoin pretty regularly and mostly as a checking account.  I do have a chunk of savings but as I understand it I only pay taxes when I """"realize"""" a profit and it has sat untouched for a few years with some adding here and there.  

My spending account is where I'm unsure what to do.  I have an auto-buy with Coinbase and I spend it using a debit card.  I've never really had more than $150-200 in there for any length of time and then I spend it on bills, lunches, and so on.  I'm sure with the price growth this year I've made some minor profit on occasion but my spending of it has been on literally thousands of separate occasions.  Am I really supposed to be reporting and paying capital gains tax on something I use like cash?  That's just seems insane to do all that calculations for what would likely be a very small amount owed in taxes.  That being said I have no illusions that Coinbase isn't doing that very thing and sending it to the IRS.  So I'd rather not pay thousands in fines for """"lying"""" either.

Maybe if Coinbase was transparent and actually let me see the information they were sending to the IRS I could just base it off their caluclations.  Would make my life a whole lot easier and I wouldn't have to worry so much.  Any ideas?","4"
"1847","I make it a point to try every bitcoin service I can get my hands on.  I have I think 12 wallets on my iphone.  I have more online accounts than I can even keep up with.  I've even found myself going back to old services forgetting I had signed up to find out """"this email/username is already registered.""""

So my current project was to have every available Bitcoin debit card I could in order to try them all.  The only one I have operational currently is from Coinbase.  

After some searching it appeared my options were Bitpay, Coinbase, Xapo, and Cryptopay.me... or so I thought.

In the last hour I have discovered that if I have a US billing address, Cryptopay cannot grant me a debit card.  Turkey? No problem.  China? Communism isn't that bad.  Out of something like 100 countries, US is unavailable.  Bitpay, after trying to sign up for the card and giving my information I had to """"email compliance@bitpay.com for further information"""" but I could not continue the debit card process.  And as soon as I put my country and state into Xapo.com (which I've had an account with for *months*) I was given the message that my account was immediately terminated, all access is cut off, and I must send them an email with a bitcoin address if I wanted any remaining balance held with their service (luckily I didn't).

None of them will touch me with a 1,000 mile fiber cable the second I put in my address.  I rarely get over worked and try to keep a calm head about things... but fuck the United States and their mountain of horseshit financial regulation that clearly fails *spectacularly* when it comes to their ~~mission~~ *excuse* of """"protecting the consumer.""""  

As much as many people, myself included, get angry with Coinbase and their invasions of privacy, I have come to realize they are the only company with the balls to even *try* to offer the service in my area.  One that may, at any moment, reward them with a cease &amp; desist order or indictment from (enter generic authoritarian incumbent-supporting government acronym here).  The fact they they cover their ass by seemingly going beyond what the regulations state is likely out of fear, not malice.  

So in closing... Thank you Coinbase.  I know you are just trying to help and the bitcoin debit card has been a very simple and easy to use service that I now appreciate much more than I did about an hour ago.  

What a fucking joke.

"1851","I was excited to use Bitcoin for my first time at a physical store, only to be embarrassed and in the end I paid for my dinner 4 times. (i've used bitcoin online with no problems many times).

Here is what happened:

1) A food truck advertises they accept Bitcoin
2) I said i'd like to pay with Bitcoin
3) He pulls out his iphone and mentions he hasn't had someone pay with Bitcoin for a while.
4) He tries to find his bitcoin wallet app - I have no idea which wallet he used as I didn't really recognize the symbol (it took him a bit of fumbling before he found it)
5) A bit more fumbling to setup the payment request
6) he figured it out and typed in the price to request: $9
7) The QR code was generated
8) I pressed the QR code symbol on my coinbase wallet and it momentarily froze/glitched my phone but 2nd time worked. I paid with my coinbase wallet by scanning the QR code - it did some weird vibration thing on my phone with absolutely no confirmation that I sent a payment - nothing happened on my wallet or his wallet visually. In the spur of the moment and with a line up behind me I scanned it again..still nothing. He said to try again, so I did and again nothing.
9) He gave me the slip that says I paid and said to get my food cause he has to help the other people behind me now
10) I press return/back on my coinbase wallet while waiting at the side and see that there are 3 pending send payments to him of $9 on my phone and says pending even 1 hr after. For some reason each transation had a decline button but when pressing it a message pops up saying it failed due to not being a request.
11) I get my food but I am now akwardly waiting at the side staring at my phone and the three pending send transactions. After he helped everyone in the line I went up to him and he said he still got nothing and went to look into the transaction history and shows the last transaction someone made with him was June 12th. During this conversation he says he's no bitcoin expert and that he lost money by accepting bitcoin because he never cashed them when they were worth """"double"""" in 2013.
11)  ended up paying with my mastercard :/
12) I logged into my coinbase account on my laptop maybe 2 hours later and see all payments have been sent to him with 8 confirmations (no longer pending)

This experience ticked me off and when I got the food I had to tell my mom, brother and his fiance that it didn't work and that I may have paid him 4 different times (now confirmed after looking at my coinbase accnt)


EDIT:
Thanks everyone!, yeah i can't f igure out if it was coinbase or his wallet that caused the problem (or maybe both?). I never had problem with coinbase hot wallet for spending online before. (maybe that was because they were using coinbase as the processor online). I'll try my mycelium wallet next time. I guess we can say my first experiment went bad ;) But hoping the next one will be better after learning some things myself from this experience (like NEVER scan a QR code more than once even if you dont think it worked and ill try myecelium next time).

"1855","**Introduction**

Gold standard is a favorable system, but it is unexpectedly eliminated by the government. Gold boasts unparalleled advantages. However, that cannot prevent the government from killing the gold standard. Below is a close look at how the gold standard is wiped out by the government step by step and how bitcoin should avoid repeating the tragedy. 
 
**Chapter 1 Gold as a natural currency**
 
Gold has been the most time-honored and widely-used currency in the human history. Its advantages cannot be ignored. 

There are 118 elements on the periodic table of elements. Gold, the No. 79 element, is adopted by humans as a symbol of honor and wealth. On the periodic table elements, there are elements in the gaseous state or the liquid state; elements whose form is unstable or which can go into combustion easily; elements who can do harm to human body; elements which are rare, hard to smelter and difficult to find by ancients. Excluding all the above elements, gold and silver are the only two elements left. In terms of stability, gold has an edge over silver because silver can be easily oxidized or vulcanized into a black color. Therefore, gold becomes the natural currency.

Featured by a stable chemical property, it means gold can act as an enduring transaction medium. To serve as currency, gold should be able to be split and cut for the convenience of carrying. Alas! Gold has all these characteristics. With a favorable physical ductility, gold can be molded into various shapes. Last but not least, gold is a rare existence in the natural world. It was generated by the explosion of new stars when fixed stars died. Up to date, humans have not yet developed the ability to make the element of gold. The only way for humans to obtain gold is to exploit gold mines on the earth. 

All these characteristics have made gold the most successful currency in the world. Gold can be traced back to 5,000 years ago. Gold was once the most popular currency, leading to the emergence of the gold standard system. Despite of the many undoubtable advantages, the gold standard was still eliminated by humans in modern times. To put it more directly, gold was marginalized in terms of its currency position. **Despite of the many undoubtable advantages, the gold standard was still eliminated by humans in modern times. To put it more directly, gold was marginalized in terms of its currency position.** 


 
**Chapter 2 Elimination process of the gold standard by the fiat money**

 **In the human history, the gold standard system has three realization forms, namely the gold coin standard system, the gold bullion standard system and the gold exchange standard system. The three realization forms constitute the substantial process in which the gold standard system was encroached step by step.** The symbolic case of marginalization of gold as a currency was the collapse of the Bretton Woods Systems. Since then, humans have entered the era of the fiat money standard system.

    The gold coin standard system refers to adopting gold coins as fiat standard coins. In other words, according to the gold coin system, gold is directly used as money, and currency manufacturing is not monopolized by the country. As long as one has the ability, he can exploit gold mines, smelter and make gold into gold coins. The gold coin standard system ruled for more than one century. 

**The gold bulletin standard system refers to replacing gold coins with bank notes. According to the gold bulletin standard system, bank notes can be equally exchanged into gold**. In China, bank notes were mainly issued by old-style Chinese private banks, which promised to settle their issued currency according to the fixed exchange rate of gold and silver. The exchange had no limits and was free. To some extent, this could guarantee that bank notes were corresponding to authentic gold. If one made false promises, one would suffer risks of being squeezed. However, this still impaired the nature of gold as a rare existence because of a non-100% reserve fund system, enabling the total number of bank notes to overtake that of gold. Under the currency system, currency issuance institutions with the right to issue currency emerged. The issuance of currency was realized through the issuance of bank notes. This suggested that currency issuance started turning into a right. 

The gold exchange standard system is a virtual gold standard system. The country required gold to be put in one place, such as the central bank, and then the country issued its domestic currency and promised to implement the fixed exchange rate of gold. If the government wanted to issue currency, it needed to purchase the equal amount of gold. To avoid abuse of the currency policy, the government pledged on national credit. This further destroyed the gold standard system. Currency issuance was monopolized by the government. The exchange rate based on the government guarantee was never realized in history.

The Bretton Woods System symbolized the peak of the gold exchange standard system. The US government in a dominating role promised to connect the USD with gold, clarifying that the price of one ounce of gold was equal to 35 USD. Later, governments all over the world issued their domestic currencies and connected them with the USD to guarantee a fixed exchange rate. If the US government wanted to issue the USD, it needed to get the same amount of gold. If other governments wanted to issue their domestic currencies, they needed to get the same amount of gold. The system greatly weakened the gold standard system. In this way, there were two anchors with the currency issuance right in principle, but in practice there were no anchors at all, because none had the right to check how much gold the Federal Reserve had. Governments all over the world did not have an institution to supervise the issuance amount of their currency. 

Quite soon, the Bretton Woods System collapsed, and the US president announced stopping exchange between the USD and gold in 1971. The gold standard system was eliminated. Since then, governments all over the world have adopted the credit money standard system. The credit money standard system has existed for nearly half a month. Despite that, gold is still regarded a kind of currency, universally acknowledged in the international community. However, its position as a currency has been weakened, just having the value storage function. 

**The process for the credit money system to replace the gold standard system was to first turn gold from a currency in circulation into a currency of settlement. Later, its settlement function was also deprived of, which turned gold into a value storage currency.** 

**Chapter 3 Risks of bitcoin to undergo marginalization of gold**

Bitcoin simulates physical properties of gold in terms of design. It is also rare, endurable, separable and portable. After more than seven years of market selection, bitcoin has grown into an indispensable Internet currency. It has also found its applications in the offline economic life. 

At present, development of bitcoin has encountered its bottleneck. The bitcoin block is too small to make room for more transactions. The bitcoin community is also hotly discussing about techniques to expand the transaction capacity of bitcoin.
 
Now, there are mainly two proposals for expansion of bitcoin. First, maintain the payment function of bitcoin, and directly refer to the onchain sacling with hard fork. Second, persist in turning bitcoin into a settlement network, build the second layer of network based on bitcoin and use the technique of side chain and lightning network to enhance the payment function of bitcoin. 

There is nothing new in the world. Though bitcoin is still a leading technique, it is a representation of historical events. After the gold coin standard system was stably implemented for one hundred years, the gold coin standard system was altered by a group of wise bankers and private bank owners into the gold bulletin standard system. After two world wars, the gold bulletin standard system was turned by those led by the US government into the gold exchange standard system. After two world economic crises, the US government took little effort to completely eliminate the gold standard system, thus building the modern credit currency system. 

**Bitcoin has not yet developed for eight years, but it has been faced with the selection of “bitcoin standard system,” “bitcoin block system” or “bitcoin exchange system.”**

Direct use of bitcoin is similar to the “gold coin standard system.” Here, the author gives it a new name, “bitcoin standard system.” In the lightning network, the main chain of bitcoin is expanded to the second layer of protocol, and the main chain just undertakes the settlement function, which is similar to “gold bulletin standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin block standard system.” Use of the side chain to build a brand-new payment platform is similar to “bitcoin exchange standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin exchange standard system.”

    When people used bank notes to replace gold coins as the currency in circulation, ease of use of bank notes was greatly highlighted compared with a pile of gold coins, and to print bank notes took less cost compared with mining, smelting and casting of gold coins. People were ready to use bank notes. However, there were no free banquets in the world. While enjoying the convenience brought by bank notes, people had to face the concentration of rights in banks. They obtained the right to issue currency and had some reserve fund. Apparently, the gold standard system was the only one to suffer from this. **In fact, people were deprived of their right to safeguard their private property.**
 
People take delight in using the lightning network and side chain to design a set of more convenient and cheaper payment network. They get not only convenient, but also cost reduction. People have to believe more block chain operators, the hub of the lightning network and the side chain platform. Maybe, we can confidently think that, with nodes, there will not be some reserve fund or cheats of the side chain platform and hub. However, more than a hundred years ago, developers of bank notes also promised so. Once users have to pay an expensive price to check their own accounts (the main chain settlement system must be expensive), users have lost their ability to verify their accounts. **In this way, the ability of bitcoin to protect inviolability of the private property will be challenged.**
 
If the bitcoin network turns from a payment network into a settlement network, it means the death of the “bitcoin standard system,” and the bitcoin will lose one of its three functions, namely payment, value storage and settlement, just like what had happened to gold several hundreds of years ago. With the increasing number of banks, more and more bank notes were printed, but the reserve fund rate was decreasing. Gold had to say goodbye to its settlement function. When bitcoin’s main chain is connected with various lightning networks and side chains, will the settlement function of bitcoin also be deprived of? Logically speaking, if the main chain settlement cost is too high, the market must find a cheaper way, such as connecting side chains with sub-side chains, or bridging two different lightning networks to achieve direct cross-chain settlement without the trouble of closing channel on the main chain. The last question is when bitcoin will be deprived of its value storage function. 

 
**Chapter 4 Failure of gold to protect the gold standard system and failure of the small block of bitcoin to protect the “bitcoin block system”**

Gold boasts lots of natural advantages. It is a decentralized currency in real sense, but the gold standard system was still eliminated. Natural advantages and physical properties of gold could not protect the gold standard system, but humans could. 

When Keynes challenged against the gold standard system, governments all over the world followed him. None wanted to stand out to protect the gold standard system or the protection force was too small. People were happy to see the increasing number of their paper coins and experience the convenience of paper coins, but were blind to the cost they paid for these. 

Bitcoins are decentralized and can ignore enemies like governments. However, the truth was gold could not protect the “gold standard system” with its physical properties. The decentralization property of bitcoin will not be so powerful to outweigh physical properties of gold. **Whether decentralization of bitcoin could protect itself relies on humans or talents which can maintain its decentralization instead of a religion-like small block.** The small block refuses more users to join the “bitcoin standard system.”
In the human history, the “gold bulletin standard system” and the “gold exchange standard system” which offered more convenient but were also more complex were created by allowing fewer and fewer people to join the “gold coin standard system.” At last, governments used the credit money system to totally eliminate the “gold standard system.”

**During the development process of bitcoin, will bitcoin repeat the tragedy of gold? The author thinks this will not happen, because people can avoid it by expanding its bigger block.** 

One after another world economic crisis reminded people of the gold standard system. Satoshi Nakamoto published “On brink of second bailout for banks” on The Times on January 3, 2009. Did it warn bitcoin fans that the “bitcoin standard system” was going to be eliminated? 


**Chapter 5 Not to refuse new techniques but not to let new techniques eliminate the “bitcoin standard system”**

 Here, the author does not refuse the lightning network and the side chain. These techniques are great. However, if they are accepted at the cost of refusing bigger blocks, people will lose the “bitcoin standard system.” That is the least expected.

    Here, the author supports establishing various high techniques on bigger blocks. While enjoying high techniques, people can also use the backward “bitcoin standard system” to protect the foundation of their private property right. 


**Chapter 6 Conclusion** 

One after another world economic crisis has aroused people’s nostalgia of the gold standard. As it is stated above, Satoshi Nakamoto had warned bitcoin fans of the potential risk of losing the “bitcoin standard system.”

"1882","So last Friday I realized I needed to renew a subscription to a streaming site for football, last year I paid with paypal, this year their only accepting Bitcoin.

I initiated a transfer for $25 worth of bitcoin, they said it would take 3-5 days to transfer, spoiler alert it took 5 days.

Except Coinbase wont accept my debit card (its a payroll card that is attached to the same bank account I transferred the original amount from). Ive emailed them but havent heard back from them. I need to pay for the service by sunday but cant wait another 3-5 days for it to transfer.

"1883","We are going to get a press release here shortly from BitFinex but I wanted to give a perspective on what has and has likely happened over the past several days.

1) Let's get this fact absolutely clear the coins that were hacked from the segregated BitGo wallets were coins of BFX **customers** not of the company itself -- so as we come to determine what percentage btc holders (and possibly active USD lenders) are getting haircut remember this includes no offering from the company to offset those losses nor have they taken a direct financial loss as a result of the hack(although a ton of secondary loss in their brand, trust and credibility). 

2) Over the course of the last several days I am 100% aware that Giancarlo (CFO) has been making his rounds to a number of influencers, market makers and big players -- I suspect Phil Potter (CSO) and others are doing the same and they are making swearheart deals or otherwise try and regain their trust in making these players whole again. I believe this will come at the cost of a greater burden of haircuts put on the plebs that are all but defenseless at this point.

3) They are smart enough however to understand they can't totally fuck the plebs -- after all they are still going to need order flow from active retail traders to entice the MMs to feed off of so I highly anticipate they will offer some token gestures to the plebs -- the simplest would be to offer something free trading for 6 months but I have heard enough rumors (coming from Giancarlo) of a bfxcoin to think it could be played in angle to appease the plebs, keep them involved with BFX and tie them to its sustained success 

The most important aspect to this release is what, if anything is BFX as a company pleading financially to those that are getting haircuts ? We don't even know formally how much BFX as a company itself has in assets but they 100% responsible in failing to follow industry best practices. However with that said the damage to brand/trust/image has been done and it actually in the best interest of BFX to not offer any direct monetary compensation or offset those losses from their own funds as it does little to improve their image beyond a token level effort. The damage is done so they need to focus on what they can do with the assets and cash they have rather than turn a 63% haircut into a 40% haircut.

"1884","Hello, i am a virgin to this kind of stuff. So i purchased .17 bitcoin and sent it to my bitcoin core wallet, but i just realized it has yet to sync, and is 3+years behind. Its running on a relatively old laptop so im not surprised its taking this long.

My main question is can i get the bitcoin i sent back into my circle wallet? Its been confirmed delivered to the address on b-core. This is a time sensitive thing so any help is appreciated.

Thank you.","3"
"1885","Hello, 

I would like to ask this community to listen to my situation and offer your personal opinions/suggestions. They are greatly appreciated, so thank you in advance for offering your time and sharing your knowledge.

So, I first became a buyer, &amp; since holder of bitcoin in October 2015 (I've yet to spend bitcoin on services or products). For the past 10 months I've slowly been accumulating bitcoins in $20 increments weekly, while making larger purchases when I can afford too. I currently hold about 5 bitcoins.  

I'm in my early 20's and work in the financial industry. I strongly believe in bitcoin's ability to initiate the transition and propel the global acceptance of the age of digital currency. To get to the point, I want to know what you think about setting up an account in order to receive a percentage of my salary in bitcoin. I still need cash to pay my expenses (at the moment) but would like to accumulate bitcoin more consistently and conveniently. I can afford to make this decision. I've spent a long time running through the outcomes of going down this path. I'm financially comfortable in receiving 5-10% of my salary in BTC. 

What would you do if you were in my kind of situation given your knowledge and experience? What else am I not taking into consideration, that I should be thinking about?","3"
"1886","Millions are stolen from the traditional banking system every month.   It is so frequent, that it is a matter for insurance companies and banks... not the press or customers to know about.

Aside from the recent 80 mil SWIFT hack, there have been ATM hacks (est to the tune of 600 mil), newer more sophisticated SWIFT hacks (amounts undisclosed, NYT est to 20-40 mil), and countless more.   

There is little reporting on the amount of losses.   But for reference:  In 1991 the FDIC had to pay out 25 billion in insurance on customer deposits, 70 billion in 2008.   This is not """"small change""""  even given the total amount insured, these levels represented more than 1.5% of total deposits.   By comparison, the Bitfinex hack, at 0.8%, was big, but comparable.   And this was not evern related to uninsured theft.   The BRE-X gold scam was 6 billion.

You have to do some work finding reports of these.   Financial institutions are understandably reluctant to disclose information about them.   Businesses don't like advertising how they've been swindled, and how they've swindled others.

But it's abundantly clear that theft, fraud and security are *not* problems that are unique to Bitcoin.

To think that this is some sort of """"Bitcoin"""" issue is to ignore the real problem.  We have a hard time with trusting others with our money.   Bitcoin, and assets issues on the blockchain gives you a choice: learn how to do it yourself, or trust someone else.

In traditional markets... there's no choice at all.","2"

I need your help. 

On the 14/07/2016 i made a transaction of 3.4BTC from my Bitcore wallt to BTC-E. The transaction is yet to be confirmed. Transaction I.D: 4785ecea09d2e8969fd8eeb0edcea4c7218b982a0c370703ace76773f7a1cfcf

"1889","To bitfinex:

That is incorrect. 

The hack occurred at 09:45am on my account. You can see from the withdrawal on the block chain. I was bailed-in after the hack.

This means that in a legal case, in the future every single person that lost coins could argue the legality of your cut off time and socialise the losses to the future point in time.
If you have not credited me with the coins that are due to me, and your subjective cut-off time of 18:00 is deemed to be legally invalid (which it is), you could be exposed for all future depositors being equally liable for all the lost coins in a re-socialisation of losses case. 
That is massive exposure compared to the deposits between the time of the actual attack and your 18:00 cut-off time. You should seriously consider this.

I’m definitely going to sue you when enough new depositors have arrived, as I am no different to any new depositor from this point forward as we all have deposited funds after the attack.

I’m not going to be the only one bailed in, each new depositor should have the same liability as me. 

I have a very good legal case as to when the hack actually occurred.","3"

"1906","Hello! I am creating a companion for beginners, some facts that are important to the creation and support of cryptocurrency and some tips that I wish I knew before I got into crypto.

**How is cryptocurrency important to me?**

Definitions.

Fiat currency: Legal tender whose value is backed by the government that issued it. 

Cryptocurrency is a new way of transmitting money. The goal is to create a free market, in which 
exchange of goods and currency can occur without the interference of a corrupt regulatory body. In most modern countries, this is not an issue (except for banned illicit substances in the modern state, which was a primary reason bitcoin took off here in America). US citizens enjoy a wide variety of product with strong regulation and infrastructure making crypto fall into the typically technological fallacy, a complicated technology for a simple use. Cryptocurrency will probably not gain traction until the US financial system is considered untrustworthy worldwide and the need to send large amounts of capital securely to trusted parties will be needed. But as technology and the world network grows, the need for a flexible currency will become imminent and cryptocurrency has the structure and technology to support it. 

**""""It is not a matter of if, but when.""""**

Until lawmakers see cryptocurrency as a viable alternative currency and create regulation that protects the everyday consumer, bitcoin will remain in the dark. But traction has slowly been growing, and the government and banks have been taking note.

Regulation is “usually” beneficial for the modern citizen since it protects consumers from being taken advantage of by untrustworthy businesses. But in countries with unstable governments with uncontrollable inflation issues, regulation is minimal which makes trade in third world countries difficult and risky. Cryptocurrencies can fill in that gap.

Adding to that fact, many countries are expressing frustration with the US government's control over international trade. The US dollar has become the main source of currency to make trades worldwide and many states are looking to challenge its superiority (Google: China's currency war). Cryptocurrency, as a decentralized currency, does not have these issues since no organization controls the supply of cryptocurrencies.

**Current Problems and Opionions**

Cryptocurrency currently is highly speculative. There is no current utilitarian use except for transferring payments for small goods to untrusted third parties, trading on exchanges, or sending large sums to others worldwide instantaneously, which is a fairly small market.

Inside manipulators are a huge issue in cryptocurrency. BE CAREFUL TAKING FINANCIAL ADVICE FROM PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET. There are many investment firms attempting to monetize the blockchain with the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may provide no greater utilitarian use than a tested and trusted cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.

Lastly, investing into cryptocurrency is similar to investing into a open source project. Purchasing cryptocurrencies are an investment hoping that DEVELOPERS can create programs and applications that the layman will use. Only this way will cryptocurrencies will grow and develop into the iconic currency that all its proponents want it to be.","4"

28-Day TRIG Token Crowdsale to Begin Thursday, September 8th

(ATLANTA, August 19, 2016) – Blocksafe (https://www.blocksafefoundation.com/), the first blockchain-based system to provide secure access, personal monitoring and control to owners of firearms using smart gun technology, will build out its Blocksafe blockchain using Lisk sidechain technology and will issue a new token for use on that chain called “Trigger” (TRIG). To fund this effort, the Blockchain Foundation will conduct a 28-day crowdsale, commencing on Thursday, Sept 28th , at 10 am pt.

“Blocksafe represents a revolution in managing access to firearms through the creation of a blockchain for smart gun technology,” said Blocksafe founder and CEO Kevin Barnes. “This will allow for gun owners to secure, manage and control access to who can use their firearms, disabling stolen weapons, while maintaining a decentralized database that has no central point of failure or control.”

Triggers will be the token that makes the Blocksafe blockchain work, and it will work with a planned array of smart gun technologies such as magazines, locks and other Trigger-enabled hardware including 3rd party and user-created hardware that can be 3D printed or manufactured.  

Of the 100 million Triggers that will ever exist, 30 million will be offered during the token crowdsale, which will be co-hosted by Bittrex (www.bittrex.com), the leading global alternative cryptocurrency exchange.  The crowdsale takes place over 28 days with a first-day bonus of 20 percent and accelerating price throughout the sale:

Thursday, September 8, 11 am pt, 8000 TRIG per bitcoin (24 hours)
Friday, September 9, 11 am pt,  6400 TRIG per bitcoin (lasts 7 days)
Thursday, September 16, 11 am pt,  6000 per bitcoin (7 days)
Thursday, September 23, 11 am pt, 5400 TRIG per bitcoin (7 days)
Thursday, September 30, 11 am pt, 5000 TRIG per bitcoin (7 days)
Thursday, October 7 11 am pt , crowdsale ends.

Update: I was contacted by Support and they said I should use the recovery tool. It is a group vault and it didn't work, as the tool got stuck at Step 2 in """"Please wait..."""". So we tried again and the same error. I was then notified by a user that the group vault can't be recovered using the tool!!!! You can even read it in their Repository ReadMe:   https://github.com/coinbase/multisig-tool/blob/master/README.md  
  
    Improvements missing
    
    1. There is currently no error checking whatsoever. That means the tool won't let you know if something is wrong with your input or with anything else. It will just silently stop working.
    
    2. There is also currently no support for group vaults.

Hey reddit,

I am extremely frustrated with Coinbase, their platform and their support.  
I have held funds in their multisignature vault and wanted to withdraw them on July 7th. Due to their broken platform I was not able to do so, as the transaction was stuck in """"creating transaction"""" indefinately. The same process was working for withdrawals from this vault without issues before.  

I immediately contacted support which was not able to help me. They even had this amazing autoreply after 2 days because they didn't answer me:

    Jul 21, 2016 07:41AM
    Thank you for contacting Coinbase Support! We sincerely apologize for not having been able to answer your request in a reasonable amount of time.
    
    If this is still a priority for you and you have been unable to find a solution in our Support Center (https://support.coinbase.com), simply reply to this email with a note that you still need help (you don’t need to re-explain the issue you’re experiencing), and we will do our best to address it as soon as possible. If your issue has been resolved please do not reply to this email.
    
    Thank you for your patience during this time and for your continued support while we work to improve our services.

Even after I explained all of it to them again they weren't able to resolve this issue, and exactly 34 days ago they sent me this: """"... we’ll need to wait for the developers to take a look and fix it. My apologies for the issue.""""  

I was mildly annoyed but atleast I was happy that it will be fixed soon. Well... I was wrong...  

After waiting 3 weeks I contacted them again because nobody gave me an update and the issue was still not resolved. They responded with:

    AUG 21, 2016  |  05:12AM PDT
    Randy replied:
    
    Hello again xxxx,

    Sorry again for the issue, and all the trouble this may have caused. I’ll make sure to contact to back before the end of the day on Tuesday.

I was slightly more annoyed but thought it would now be fixed soon after 6 weeks for holding the money hostage. But tuesday came and guess what... no answer from Coinbase. I am not the person to raise issues on social media to get attention on the topic, but I literally warned them and said that if they don't fix this I will feel forced to do so. I hope this post forces them to finally fix this critical issue

TL;DR: Coinbase has 50 BTC in the multisig vault that can't be withdrawn for 6 weeks because the platform is broken. They promise a fix but don't deliver within their own deadline. Outcry on social media so that the issue gets finally fixed.","3"

"1921","Assumption1: 60 - 70% of bitcoin mining occurs in China, distributed under seperate (each &lt; 51%) names, but under one controlling China gov
Assumption2: China gov is going to act in their own self interest and not necessarily as a rational actor


Facts:
Recently Baidu pulled advertising for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 
China gov has spoken about bitcoin in the past and is aware of the technology and the potential
China gov is motivated to stop capital flight/movement out of china 


Theory:
China gov is going to create and launch its own crypto currency (lets call it chinacoin)
China gov, using ability to control the actions of miners, will overnight make bitcoin mining illegal, and simultaneously encourage miners to point their hashing power at chinacoin (new coin, high rewards etc)
They will do this just after a bitcoin difficulty adjustment. The bitcoin network cant adjust to the new low hash state until the high difficulty 2016 blocks have passed, possibly taking months until the next lower adjustment is found


Effects:
During the outage time, bitcoin blocks will fill more than usual, hosts will have an issue with mempools, any transactions relying on multiple block confirmation will take much longer or not at all, a mass exodus will cause blocks to fill more creating more pressure.
Bitcoin is effectively unusable and down, confidence in the protocol will be significantly lost

Chinacoin is here, controlled by China gov
Advertising on China websites of new chinacoin
Development of cryptocurrencies in other countries (rest of world) lessens due to lack of confidence


Advantages for China gov:
No/reduced capital flight issues
Control of all mining is within China (not external gov)
Development of cryptocurrencies actively encouraged under China gov control (consider this a developmental head start on the rest of the world)","3"

"1923","So this idea has had roughly 2 minutes of brainstorming, but it could be the next big thing, who knows!

I read an article today about Google and how in 2017 they will be punishing websites that have a inline popup box, which I think is a load of shit. If a website wants to promote something with a popup, it's their fucking site, let them! If their visitors don't like it, they'll leave, and Google will detect a high bounce rate anyway and be able to demote them in their rankings.

And it got me thinking... Google have WAYYY too much control over websites. Whatever they say goes, unless you want to lose your rankings and let your entire online business go down the toilet.

And we all know, no one will ever be able to take over Google!!!

Or can we, as a collective, create a community powered search engine?

So, my 2 minute brainstorm idea is...

What if a search engine was created, and everyone has 1 vote per webpage, and you can cast your vote to a specific page that you believe is the most relevant for your search, and that is essentially how all the webpages on the internet are ranked.

Demo:

- Billy searches for """"game of thrones episodes"""" and comes across the current Google organic listings and sees Wikipedia's Game of Thrones page first. 
- He looks at the page and finds what he's looking for, so he votes for this page, which essentially says """"I found what i'm looking for on this page for the search 'game of thrones episodes'"""".
- Millions of users around the world follow the same scenario, and eventually you have a search engine which is ranked by what users have actually deemed to be useful to their query, and not what Google believes is useful.

But how do you stop people gaming the system and getting more votes? In the same way we could stop the government gaming the elections of course... by giving everyone a satoshi/token that is unique to them and unforgeable, which they can use to place their vote.

"1929","Bitcoin Price Update for August 31, 2016  

Market Commentary (BTC):  

Although things were looking pretty good yesterday for near term bulls, the market once again turned south following a tag of the 580 $ resistance area.  Now price is sitting back down in the 570 - 575 $ area where it has felt so comfortable for over a month.  We are not expecting any action in the market until later in the weekend going into early next week, therefore we remain neutral on a market that is stagnant and indecisive at current levels.  We will continue to remain patient overall given a still mixed bag of technicals and some waiting time until the next fundamental catalyst (Bitcoin Core 0.13.1), however we are willing to hold our small VST ProTrade long for the time being.

Today we revisit the 6-hour chart for a look at the short to medium term prospects.  We can see that price remains flat within the pivot area, and also continue to hug volume profile PoC, while market structure vacillates between bullish and bearish.  Also note that trading volumes remain anemic and volume profile looks relatively thin on either side of the current trading range, however the A/D line is still slowly pressing to the upside so it appears as though there are still buyers around current levels. Additionally, SCMR continue to paint mixed signals as we had a potential upside reversal that was cancelled a few bars later, but now we have a re-confirmation of the reversal although there has been no follow-through in price action yet. 

Moving on to momentum we can see that the near term EMA's are almost completely flat, the 200-period SMA is still bearish, and PPO is close to signaling slightly overbought conditions despite practically no movement to the upside so far this week.  Finally, we can see that Willy and RSI both failed to push sustainably above their respective centerlines, while MACD continues to dance around it's zeroline as well.  None of these indications are all that encouraging, at least not from a near term perspective, so for now we are expecting more of the same until we get closer to the holiday weekend.  

Considering how tight the market is coiling right now, and has been for some time, we think that when a break of the symmetrical triangle/consolidation range materializes it will send some shockwaves of volatility through the market.  The key levels to watch are now 540 $ on the downside and 630 $ on the upside, so keep an eye out for a break of one of these levels over the next few weeks.  A break lower would likely take us down into the MT ProTrade add zone just below 500 $, while a breakout higher would likely send prices up to more significant resistance in the form of the OTE short zone around 700 $.  For the time being, however, we continue to sit on the sidelines in order to wait for more favorable setups.

As advertised, it is fast and streamlined, almost shocking in the lack of junk on many levels.  I hope that as they fold bitcoin micropayments in it will be easy for me and others to access.

"1931","Hey, guys. Few days ago I've thought about some applied use of Bitcoin in real project, and here is what I think may work - https://pavlovdog.github.io/Pazzer

This is something about imageboard/Reddit/9GAG/etc, but with a few features:

1) You need to pay for adding a new post - but the price is really low, much cheaper than 1 cent. It's a reward for administration, no ads and other shit. I think it should work.

2) When you adding a post, you attach your bitcoin adress, so now, liking will be the same as payment. But again, this is micropayment. This is something about crowdfounding, but you can earn money even on good meme, huehuehue.

3) I think, comments should work about the same.

4) Your like/post will be added only after the transaction is in the blockchain.


What do you think about it? Amendments and criticism are welcome.

P.S. This prototype don't even has a back-end, it's just an illustration of idea (AngularJS + Semantic UI).
P.P.S. Sorry for my English, rush B CYKA BLYAD!","3"

"1933","x-post from my \/r/changetip [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/50u4y4/bitcoin_withdrawal_pending_for_over_20_hours/)

&gt;i withdrew my balance yesterday and it's still pending, it said it can take up to 24 hours. why does it take up to 24 hours just to process a bitcoin withdrawal? this should be a straightforward instant transaction from my changetip wallet to my personal wallet as it has been for accounts with other providers. you can deposit tips instantly but not withdraw instantly? waiting up to 24 hours is unacceptable for a withdrawal of your own bitcoin in this day and age, and i'm wary of how [stripped](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/4p7rw4/deposit_by_card_withdraw_by_gyft_and_paypal_were/) changetip has become.

&gt;i sent in a support request to changetip yesterday too after waiting over 5 hours for my withdrawal and still haven't gotten an email reply.

&gt;withdrawals taking this long has been the case [8](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/3wa3ca/withdrawal/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/comments/4r2apn/how_long_for_withdrawals/) months ago too, the latter took over 3 days, so it's gotten worse...

edit: i got the withdrawal and email reply minutes after posting this in /r/Bitcoin and total time it took was ~26 hours.","3"
"1934","Bitcoins image have suffered badly because of high profile hacks of exchanges and Ponzi Schemes. In it's current state bitcoin services are not dependable. The fact that bitcoin itself is intact does not help much. The services overlaying bitcoin need to be secure aswell in order for bitcoin to be useful.

I'm proposing a solution that would make it possible for services holding bitcoins to prove how big part of their assets are in cold storage without revealing how much assets they actually hold. There might be technical modifications that would allow this solution to be more decentralised, more private, more efficient or more smart and I welcome those. I hope this layout would be a good framework.

For every new account in a service, a new wallet is created. This wallet will require two out of three parties. To sign any transactions. One party is the service. One party is the user and one party is a newly established foundation/company. Ususally, more than 90% of a users funds will be put into this wallet, but it depends on the service.

There could be one or more foundations/companies like this and their daily operations typically are run entirely by software. 

The normal case is that the service  is the one that withdraws money from the cold storage, maybe their clientbase has shrunk or they need more liquid captial. When they want money from the cold storage, they tell the foundation what accounts they want to move how much assets from. The foundation then pseudonomosly publishes the request to withdraw assets and then waits for a given amount of time, like 48 hours.

Both the client and the service can monitor all requests to the foundation. If any unauthorized requests are made to the foundation, they can tell the foundation to cancel them.

The foundation has a few more features, for example, it can initiate a move of funds to a new account if the client loses it's private key. This also has a delay. The client can also directly contact the foundation and ask them to withdraw all their funds.

Every service on the internet will commit to a certain level of cold storage of their own choice. They can generate a badge that shows their level of commitment, thees badges should be considered similar to credit scores or fair trade etc. Services that don't commit to a high level of cold storage should be shun by the community. The badges could be on different levels, like a 10% of assets in a 8 hour delay and 80% of assets in a 7 days delay etc.

Because the users have a pseudonymous key to their cold storage. They can check if the service honors their commitment, not honouring the commitment for a single user should be considered fraud. IE they should have atleast their percentage of every clients assets in cold storage all the time.

This service would be good for exchanges, because it would rid the market of unprofessional actors, and it would help them to avoid being hacked, something that often ends up in a bankruptcy and lots of greif.

It would be good for users because they would know what services to trust. If someone is trying to do a ponzi scheme, they could also notice and prevent it.

The foundations could charge a fee for their features to the services or maybe it could be decentralized and live on the blockchain somehow.","2"

I have all my Bitcoin in a mycelium wallet which I apparently lost the backup seed phrase to. Hurray. Lesson learned at least?

I think my only option is a screen replacement which I've never done. My questions for /r/Bitcoin are:

Does anyone think the screen replacement would work?

If I get it done by someone else at the mall, do I get to watch them do it, or do I hand the phone over to them and they call me when it's fixed? I ask because there is no password on the phone or the wallet so if it works they could just steal my Bitcoin anyway.

"1944","Reasons:

A) It's value is relatively steady compared to many Fiat currencies, even including the Russian Ruble which it has completely out preformed.

B) It can be stored online, thus one can travel anywhere and have access to it.

C) It can be created and stored offline for unbreakable security.

The USD and Gold really have nothing on B and C.. nothing even close.  If you need to flee China, etc the only way you're getting wealth out is Bitcoin.  If the banks print trillions or your currency collapses Bitcoin will not.   I am sure the list can keep going too...","3"
"1945","Reddit and all of you on here are amazing. I've started a coincase account, and I've been made aware how to """"tumble"""" my coins if necessary. I've also received help finding the closest ATM to me. (About 3 hour round trip drive, but that isn't bad, I'm in mid-west USA, I can't ask for much better right now). I was looking for information about a bit coin debit card? Ive tried to read some forums and random reddit threads but they seem to differ or I'm just not fully comprehending the logistics. 
So 
1) how would I get one?
2) what are my options to load them? Will I have to go to the ATM that far away, or can I use my personal debit card?
3) where can they be used if anywhere, IRL. 
4) would I link it to my coinbase account or is it a separate thing entiri? 

I haven't bought any coins yet because of the 3 hour drive and I've yet to have a day off. So any tips or general info would be much appreciated. EVEN if its not related to the cards themselves. I've done a few hours of research so even if I've read what you're telling me before, I'm open to a refresher. 

The patience and overall assistance I've had is amazing haha, I'm looking forward to buying my first coins.","3"
"1946","Hello! I've been into Bitcoin for almost three years now but since I found out about it I have used just browser wallets. I recently heard it's not so safe to store them in a browser wallet so I was wondering.. Is the paper wallet safer than any other one? I'm looking to store BTC for a long time. So I've got the following questions: 



1. If any website goes down (including the one I'm going to generate the paper wallet from), will my BTC still be there? 

2. If that's the case, how can I get my funds back into a wallet? Can I get them on ANY web/offline wallet back or just on specific ones? 

3. Can I simply print it from my home printer or do I need a special type of paper/printer?

4. Why exactly is it safe? Can it be stolen? What are the risks of having it stored on a paper? 



I'm going to save BTC for a while and I decided to find a better and safer way to store them than the web browser wallet. I have already set up an old laptop with a Live CD Linux which removes every chance as soon as I shut it down, so I guess keyloggers aren't a problem anymore as I'm using that laptop JUST for cryptocurrencies. Any other suggestions for safe storage are appreciated. Thank you for taking your time to answer me.","3"

"1949","I am very new to BTC but I've decided to purchase $20,000 worth, purchasing by wire from a bank account that isn't exactly earning me much interest.  I have done a lot of reading, but I have some questions that I'd really appreciate personal experience answers for.  Here are my questions:

1 - What is your favorite exchange for this sort of a transaction and why?  I'm in the US, if that helps.  Also: I want to maximize my privacy as much as possible, with the understanding that I'm buying from an account in my name of course.

2 - Since this will be large ($20,000) from a U.S. bank (where transactions over $10,000 are generally flagged), what can I do to make sure that it goes smoothly?  I don't want to look like a cocaine dealer or whatever.

3 - If it does NOT go smoothly, does anyone have experience that would tell me in what way it would go bad?  Like, will the rest of my bank account be seized?  What's the usual set of problems to anticipate?

4 - Once I have the BTC in a BTC wallet, how easy (and expensive) will it be to anonymize it in the future?  Obviously it will all begin in my name since I'm buying from my bank.  But does anyone have experience tumbling large amounts like this?

5 - Has anyone had any experience with tax issues related to holding large amounts of BTC?  If the value increases threefold again next year, will I have to pay taxes like a capital gain?  My accountant has no clue at all, but someone here might.

6 - Lastly, even though this is a BTC forum I wonder if anyone would recommend any other crypto currencies as well?  Maybe I'll put 15 into BTC and 5 into something else if it comes highly recommended.

THANK YOU for your time.  I am excited to join the Bitcoin community and I hope that this is just a first step.","3"
"1950","So there's a lot of discussion on bitcoin's hashrate playing a role in its price, and its so dang true. I see bitcoin's price action moving steadily upwards forever (so hold) because as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make sense to sell now. This keeps getting more and more rare, and neither the US Central Bank, or any central bank can stop it at this point. We'll get to the moon, but with one acceleration at a time...

(Humor): How would I play this out? I'd pull the trigger if I see an anchor-toss as we're approaching the mid $700s, as the upside-down kettle will limit my potential losses to that price-range.

"1958","# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin &amp; Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)
* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&amp;index=1&amp;list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin Is Independent Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFOwFXlR48)
* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)

For lots of additional video resources check out the [videos wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/videos) or /r/BitcoinTV.  

**Key properties of bitcoin**

* **Limited Supply** (there will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://plot.ly/~BashCo/5.embed?share_key=ljQVkaTiHXjX2W41UiqzCn))
* **Open source** (You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin))
* **Decentralized** (Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works)
* **Permissionless** (No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network of your own free will, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking.  This makes it a truly global payment platform)
* **Censorship resistant** (No one can censor or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point))
* **Push system** (there are no chargebacks in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them)
* Designed to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

Additional Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://coin.dance/stats).  Developer resources can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-documentation) and [here](https://programmingblockchain.gitbooks.io/programmingblockchain/content/index.html).

## Where can I buy bitcoins?

You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, more can be found [here](http://howtobuybitcoin.io/) and [here](https://howtobuybitcoins.info/#!/).  

* [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en)
* [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)
* [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/) 
* [Mycelium LocalTrader](http://mycelium.com/lt/help.html) 
* [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) 
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) 
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) 

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  Also, [Lawnmower](https://lawnmower.io/) is also a handy way to make small recurring purchases of bitcoin.  If you would like your paycheck auotmatically converted to bitcoin use [Cashila](https://www.cashila.com/) or [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Here are a couple useful sites ([bitkoin.io](http://bitkoin.io/), [preev.com](http://preev.com/btc/usd)) that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google """"1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"""".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can """"be your own bank"""" and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka """"bitcoin banks"""" which will hold the bitcoins for you.


* If you prefer to """"be your own bank"""" and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).  If you prefer easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/), [Case Wallet](https://choosecase.com), or [KeepKey](http://www.keepkey.com/) is recommended.  A more advanced option is to secure them yourself using [paper wallets](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) generated offline.  

* If you prefer to let bitcoin banks manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Earning bitcoins

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.

* [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins)
* [Coinality job board](https://coinality.com/)
* [Bitgigs job board](http://bitgigs.com/)
* [xbtfreelancer.com](https://www.xbtfreelancer.com/)

You can also earn bitcoins by participating as a market maker to allow users to perform CoinJoin transactions with your bitcoins for a small fee (requires you to already have some bitcoins)

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (μL) or micrometre (μm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial """"slang"""" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits

**Welcome to the Bitcoin community and the new decentralized economy!**","3"
"1959","You may be familiar with our initiative from our many ads or you have seen the weekly documentary titled **Mr. Robot**. 
(Which, while mildly entertaining for people of below average intelligence, does not paint our company in a fair light and we have cease and desist / takedown orders pending)

Bio:  I am a SVP at ECorp, I've worked for Mr. Philip Price, our CEO, Tyrell Wellick, Terry Colby and others for 9 years.  

Along with Hal Finney and Satoshi, Terry and I were early creators of Bitcoin. Since then we have moved beyond Bitcoin to more advanced private ledgers technology.  We call this """"Blockchain 2.0""""^TM, The Internet of Money^TM.  

My computer science credentials are extensive.  After completing pre-law courses and working in the ECorp compliance department I was moved to IT.  I manage a technical staff of over 2000 people including hundreds of developers.  

My personal technical skills are significant: I have familiarity with 2-factor, DOS, Basic, basic HTML (basic is a language, basic html refers to my skill level with html), Authy, Word, Excel, Gmail, I am an expert-level user of several apps such as Spotify and have made posts on blogs that use Drupal or Wordpress.  I've used advanced programs such as disk defrag on my (supermodel) girlfreind's laptop.

Conservatively speaking I'd say my tech skills are on a level with /u/nullc however I only just heard of him a couple weeks ago so will need to research more.   I have over 100 commits on the core protocol (for ECoin).

As a corporate officer I am entitled to use of the officers only gym, track and dining room.


**About ECoin**

We are pleased at the progress ECoin is making and we think that the Bitcoin community will absolutely love it.  

We'd love to have you on board our team!


**Some benefits of ECoin:**

- with ECoin *we control the ledger*, blockchain is in hands you know and trust and not subject to the whims of users

- ECoin offers *built in compliance tools* such as the ability to reverse or block transactions for criminals, suspects and money launderers 

- ECoin is *not limited in suppliy to 21 million* or any other arbitrary number.  As a serious financial institution, we are aware that there will be far more demand than 21 million.  Therefor ECoin's supply is indefinite, just like the US dollar.  Some radicals think this isn't a benefit but 100 years of economic growth in the US shows otherwise

- ECoin is *not subject to disagreements or development debates*; as you saw a lot of Bitcoin development time wasted discussing """"scaling"""", we already have solved those matters and decisions are made in corporate offices by experienced computer scientists and economists, not simple anonymous handles on GitHub (as a side note, if any Bitcoin developers are determined qualified enough to work on ECoin, make no mistake that there will not be debate, it will be clear who they work for, whether we pay them or not) 

- ECoin is *environmentally friendly*:  using a custom issuance mechanism, ECoin is able to avoid the challenges faced by Bitcoin's archaic proof of work system (side note, one of our proposed bills will allow for carbon offsets for mining)

- Unlike Bitcoin, *ECoin can't be hacked*.  As you know, Bitcoin has been hacked multiple times.  It's not my area of expertise but my understanding is that a fault in the ledger caused by Core Developers was the cause of the MtGox hack and others.  With ECoin you have an actual, stable, trusted ledger run by a company who you know on our servers.  Should there ever be a hack, ECoin software will fork the hacked funds away and revert them to the rightful owner.  Why support hackers?

- When people pull out their wallet and look at an address they want to know that the amount of coins shown are accurate.  Bitcoin has no way of knowing what value an address has other than the blockchain...which isn't even controlled by anyone!  No offense, but that's crazy.  With ECoin, what you see is what you get, or as we techies say """"wysiwyg"""", the balance shown is validated by us.  Every time.

- ECoin has seemless integration with all the products and services you know and trust from ECorp: mortgages, health care, smart contracts etc....all tied to your ECoin wallet

- ECoin is offering a SKD and for app developers to build on top of our platform.  This is where the Bitcoin community can help as it has occured to us that some of you may have technical knowledge or understanding of ledgers.  Once you pay the $1600 registration fee and file with FinCen and your state regulator as a PECSD (Prospective ECoin Softward Developer) you will be scheduled for a back ground check, review of political affiliations and a drug test, if all of this goes well, within 12-18 weeks you will receive  approval to be a FECSD (Full ECoin Software Developer) and be authorized to present your ideas and applications to our technology review committee [please note that all technology developed under this licence is the property of ECorp]

- ECoin does not intend to hoard this technology, we are allowing its use by a consortium of major banks 

- Bitcoin is not backed by anything.  ECoin is backed by the full faith and credit of one of the world's largest most well known companies.

- Today we are working on providing regulatory clarity and assisting in helping lawmakers make laws that work to govern this technology.  Together with our partners at the SEC, FTC and others as well as our counterparts in the EU and Asia we have created a framework we think works.  Without more regulation now, inevitably there will be even worse laws later.  Whether you love or just like ECoin and still believe in Bitcoin, supporting these regs makes sense.  It's time to grow up and distance yourselves from Silk Road and other bad actors.  With increased clarity we all win.

We know that not everyone will support ECoin, there will be some """"purists"""" who think that a blockchain should be some sort of permanent record that is difficult to change *even if there is lost money or crime involved*.  We at ECorp don't find this any more serious than the people claiming Ron Paul was right about the economy or that the Gulf of Tonkin was caused by a false flag operation.  The era of the wingnuts has passed and CryptoCurrency^TM is here to stay.  In an alliance with law enforcement and through patents and other means the old world of Bitcoin is gone.  (In the words of my favorite president, GW Bush """"You are either with us or against us."""")

Don't take this evolution as a loss, see it as a victory.  The road paved by Satoshi, Hal Finney, me, Terry Colby and the other inventors of this technology has you to thank for its early growth.  We are eternally grateful as we move forward in the next steps, with or without you.

Let's work together to make CryptoCurrency^TM a real innovation in technology!

"1960","So for about a month now (only took a proper interest recently) I have been looking into bitcoin whenever I had internet at Uni and while the geek in me loves the conceptband realisation the pessimist says it will die out. I had that 1 usd worth of bitcoin for a while and have no actual use for it. 

I just moved to Budapest, and expected to find more than a mere half a dozen places where they sorta-kinda take btc. Most people here don't even know what it is while in my little Serbia they at least heard about it. 

My question / concern is with how will I be able to buy bread in the morning with btc one day? And average person visiting the sub will do a 180 instantly. It just does not seem approachable and user friendly. It is not stupidproof.




Tl;dr how does bitcoin plan on becoming actively relevant and used?","2"

"1964","Title says it all. Does anyone know how I can purchase bitcoin using venmo? Also, is there is a way that is indirect (Venmo --&gt; _____ --&gt; Bitcoin) what would be the best way to do that?  ","4"
"1965","Has it been confirmed that the website was actually blocked? If it was, it speaks to the tech-savviness of the LBC community in Russia (and perhaps suggests that the number of traders is small and organized).

"1966","Lawnmower got all it's valid stars from being an amazing, let's turn our change into Bitcoin. It then [pivoted](http://imgur.com/a/53cvN) and personally I can't get my monies from it. And, most importantly is raking all the good graces of its original purpose and banking off that.

The same service it provided once upon a time, was what it was graded on. Note it has a new service and it should be graded independent of that. 

My argument is, they should have discontinued and moved on.

"1967","Can anyone please tell me what kind of identification is required to buy bitcoin with Circle? A simpl e scan of your ID or do they ask for selfie or webcam activation?","3"
"1968","Am I missing something? This new bitmain pool called BTC.com is a 0% PPS pool. Their site, pool.btc.com, shows they have found no blocks yet and they are currently hashing at 1.15PH/s. 

I remembered seeing a block that was relayed by them a day or two ago, I went back to find it and I did, block 430723 by BTC.com. On their normal btc.com site they are showing that this pool has found 55 blocks this month and is currently hashing at ~25PH/s.

Am I missing something?","3"
"1969","Apologies if this is a repeat post, I'm not a regular in this community, but I was curious and wanted to ask a question:

I'm a young adult, working professional, with a stable career. I'm not rich or poor - my SO and I own a house that is about the average price in our city. My income is mostly from my paycheck, plus I earn some rental income. I'm saving for retirement, have a few investments, and such. My expenses are same as most everyone's - mortgage, car payment, groceries, clothing, entertainment. I certainly shop online for time to time, especially clothes and gifts.

Should I be considering getting and using Bitcoin? I'm somewhat aware of what it is - a decentralized cryptocurrency that is not regulated by any government. I could see this having a lot of appeal for people - for example, people who have a need to buy things from a lot of different companies, or people using it in their business, people facilitating a lot of online transactions, etc. I've heard the technology is amazing, secure, and will have a huge impact on all currencies around the world, and how transactions are conducted/regulated.

What do I, your average working professional, stand to gain from using Bitcoin? How do you use it and what do you like to use it for? What makes people concerned about getting involved in Bitcoin now, rather than waiting for it to become more mainstream? I mean, if my country's currency gets taken over by Bitcoin and my paycheck starts to be Bitcoin instead of dollars, OK, cool. There's probably reasons that could be a good thing. But what is the difference that that will make in my life? Is Bitcoin much different than a regular fiat currency? If so, how?

So I guess my questions are, 1) what are the advantages of getting involved in using Bitcoin now, rather than later when it becomes more mainstream? And 2) for your average person who just pays their mortgage, buys coffees, buys groceries, saves for retirement, etc., what difference will Bitcoin make in my life if I do decide to use it?","3"
"1970","Without any announcement coinbase.com decided to lower the deposit limits! Down to $400 from $10,000 deposit limit. Just wondering if other people are affected as well? Why was this change not announced?","2"

"1972","Just got off the phone with paypal support about and old business account I have . I was downgrading my account because i never use it. I told the rep i might do a business using bitcoin.. they said if i do a business with it to contact them because they explore options using bitcoin on case by case basis, unofficially.

"1974","I ordered a product from their site (http://cryptosteel.com/) today, was prompted to pay, and selected to do so in bitcoin. I sent the bitcoin to the right address and was told that I would receive a confirmation email with my order details after. An hour passed, then two, now it's been 5 hours and I've received no email.

Any chance this site is not the legitimate one? And if it is, what gives? I've heard that they don't respond to emails often so I figure i'd try reddit to see if I've been bamboozled.

Thanks.","3"
"1975","Hey! I am a PayPal user, and am researching about Bitcoin. I found this reply to a Bitcoin pro thread on this subbeddit, and it really got me thinking about Bitcoin:

""""For the consumer bitcoin is a nightmare. It basically removes all protection from the consumer. 

A seller can run with your money and there's no recourse. 

Paypal is 100x better (not even hyperbole) for the consumer at the moment. You have superb protection when paying with paypal. 

The consumer is who a currency/payment portal should protect. The seller is what bitcoin (currently) protects. 

Completely backwards.""""


Any counter argument or such? 

Thanks for the replies.","2"
"1976","So for a long time I have kept my coins on exchanges and with circle/coinbase/etc. I was a bit afraid of storing them in a wallet on my computer because my computers were old and I wasn't sure about their security state.

Can anyone give me a link on how to properly create a secure suite of wallets for my various coins?

How about some advice on security in general in terms of a new laptop?

Thanks.","3"
"1977","Sorry, I don't get it. Do we see stories of all the people who do buy bitcoins directly getting hassled by the feds because the bitcoins which they originally purchased were then used to buy drugs/guns whatever by someone else down the line after they spent them? I don't see how there is anything to worry about legally, just because you are the original purchaser, as long as none of the wallets the coins go into after your original purchasing wallet can be linked to you. Or even as long as the final wallet which made the illegal purchase cannot be proven that it was you who owns it. 

Otherwise, it seems like there would be tons of stories of people who bought bitcoins  facing federal investigation at some point, because somewhere along the line some coins they spent went to someone who then bought something illegal and got caught? I just don't see how it creates any legal liability at all or why investigators would even waste their time making the trace to the originating point.","3"
"1978","Hey r/bitcoin,

I'm new to bitcoin, and new to tor, but not completely inept with computers. 
Having said that I am getting rapidly lost in the wealth of information that there is out there.
My question is what is necessary for me to use Bitcoin to the highest possible degree of anonymity? As in, what things to I need to set up etc.
I have the latest version of Tor installed of course, and I know how to and am using a VPN, but past this I have little idea what to do.
Could people possibly help me out/give me some pointers?
The wallet I was planning on using is Bitcoin Core, and it's nearly downloaded all the way (am having some issues so would be open to alternative wallet suggestions).

TL;DR tell me what I need to do to use my bitcoin wallet anonymously","3"
"1979","What if we were to organize  and ether monthly  or biannual  hold day?

It would  consist of people  buying at least  .01 bitcoin  and placing  it in their holding spot. It would be a good way to have a rolling  spin on the coin market. Plus habit  behaviors are good for attention  to the coin.

Would the community  be willing  to perform  such events?","3"
"1980","Want to exchange my BTC for USD. I see some people offering Paypal, and I also see some people offer gift cards.

"1982","I've been approached by a very enthusiastic group to join a new business venture in the US to issue gold backed tokens secured on the Bitcoin blockchain. This seems like a fantastic business but there are clearly significant regulatory considerations that concern me, especially in the US.

I understand that such a service would likely be a money transmitter that is required to required to register as such with FinCEN and in all 50 states. I'm basing that on:

* [FinCEN Ruling on PM Broker](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2015-R001.pdf)
* [FinCEN Guidance on Users, Administrators &amp; Exchanges](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FIN-2013-G001.pdf)
* [Coindesk Article](http://www.coindesk.com/fincen-rules-commodity-backed-token-services-are-money-transmitters/)

If such is the case, what are the extent of such a company's requirements for conducting KYC? Is it limited to just clients that interact directly with the business for the issuance and redemption of tokens? Or does it extend to any and all third parties that end up own the tokens? 

The later seems impossible.

Also, is there anyway for such a business to somehow avoid being classified as a money transmitter? Could this be possible if the business did not actually sell the tokens, but rather just issued them to people that deposit gold into its custody?

I would really appreciate any advice or tips for who to speak with on this. Thank you.","3"

He didn't even looked at the Polish Mtgox Bank Account that we sent our deposits that has never arrived at our Mtgox Account!
Mtgox Trustee Kobayashi have been rejected our claims for cash we sent to the Mtgox Polish Bank for deposits! Has he even checked that Polish MtgCOCK Bank Account???

"1987","Hey all

So I used breadwallet but moved to Copay due to multiplatform support.

I was considering to make it multisig for more security; Laptop and Phone.

The issue is I tend to format/reset my laptop every 3-4 or 6 months. And one is overdue...

I wanted to ask: I assume CoPay will each 'devices' a unique restore key. I can use the one for my PC practically endlessly to restore then do transactions when I format it? 

If thats not the case can you explain how will it work etc?

Thanks in advance","3"

"1996","This is a bounty for people to try out http://answer.market/

One answer for a joke, minimum number of Satoshis (100,000 -- the default). I'll do this for any joke.

One answer for a picture of a potato with Answer.Market written on it, 1,000,000 Satoshis. No Photoshops, you need to sacrifice a real potato for this.

And lastly: Make an answer and get someone to buy it. This should be public, and send me a link of the thread. I'll pay you twice what they paid for it, up to 0.05BTC. Sending to the address you used.

I have more of these on Voat, but you'll need an account there to do it: https://voat.co/v/answermarket","3"
"1997","I have a few concerns about using Bitcoins, I say 'Concerns', what I actually mean is that there are parts I don't understand. 

I understand that when I purchase lets say £50 worth of BC, I get a string of random letters and numbers that represents that £50 in BC. 

What I can't understand is, what if you want to pay for something that costs less than £50, lets say I want to buy something that costs £24.95, how am i reimbursed the £25.05..?

I have read about it Bitcoin in depth and can't seem to find the answer to this question.","2"

"1999","So all of my google searches come up with how to buy and sell bitcoin. I'm looking for a way to put mu coins to use. I've run across bitbond and other peer to peer sites. Can anyone make some recommendations for ways to invest coins and earn a return in coins?

Some challenges I've faced are:

1) Some sites exclude US investors 
2) Many p2p sites (including bitbond) are very limited in the opportunities available 

Thoughts? Thanks!","4"
